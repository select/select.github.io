    "Plot": "An office worker has repeatedly been late for work, and his manager has threatened to dismiss him if it keeps happening. To make sure that he wakes up in the morning, the man makes an arrangement with a friend. He ties a rope to his foot, then hangs the other end of the rope out of his bedroom window, so that in the morning his friend can come by and pull the rope to wake him up. But during the night, a drunk comes by and pulls the rope. Annoyed at being woken up unnecessarily, the man dumps water on the drunk. The drunk sits on the man's doorstep for a while, and then decides to use the rope to play a practical joke on the man.",
