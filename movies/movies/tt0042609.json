      "description": "This biography of Jackie Robinson is not a great film. More than anything it represents a significant milestone in baseball and the civil right movement. Jackie doesn't do a terrible acting job which you don't really notice because the screen play, although light, is very face paced. The viewer is rocketed through the life of a young pre-teen Jackie Robinson, his football college career, touches on his military service in the second world war, his minor league career, and through his 1949 season with the Brooklyn Dodgers.",
