      "description": "Eyes will be poked, noses pulled, faces slapped, heads bonked -- the usual sort of slapstick awaits the viewer in this collection of Three Stooges shorts strung together as a feature film involving a ventriloquist giving a history lesson to his dummy. Here Moe, Larry and Curly appear in a variety of guises: the Stooges as cowboys, the Stooges as tramps, the Stooges as dog-groomers, the Stooges as plumbers, the Stooges as professors, and so on, with each adventure aiming for maximum yuks. Starring: Curly Howard, Moe Howard, Paul Winchell, Larry Fine Distributed by Columbia Pictures Corporation Classified PG",
