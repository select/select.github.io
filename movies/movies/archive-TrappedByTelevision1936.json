      "description": "Not to be confused with \"Murder By Television\" starring Bela Lugosi. This film is about a young inventor trying to get his television system financed. A gang of crooks are out to stop him. This film is considered science fiction by many because the concept of television was still on the drawing boards in the 30's, but it's also a comedy. Stars Lyle Talbot, Mary Astor, Nat Pendleton, and Joyce Compton. Whether you would consider this scifi or not, you should find it entertaining anyway.",
