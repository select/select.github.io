    "Plot": "This Terrytoon about golfing animals from 1930 is a synchronized sound film, with a decent sound track that could easily be omitted for a show in a theater which had not been wired for sound. There were still several thousand such theaters in the US in 1930.The film itself is decent, although it shows the usual Terry touches to make it less expensive to produce. There is a lot of looping from the first shot. The gags in the first half are well conceived, executed and timed. The writers must have spent a lot of time on the golf links to know the funny habits of golfers. By the final third, though the movie has slowed down and looks as if it is being filled out to bring up the running time.",
