      "description": "\"The Man Who Turned to Stone\" is a 1957 American black-and-white horror-science fiction film directed by László Kardos . The film stars Victor Jory , Ann Doran , and Charlotte Austin , and it presents a blend of horror and juvenile delinquency themes commonly seen in the era's B-movies. The story unfolds at the La Salle Detention Home for Girls, where social workers Dr. Jess Rogers and Carol Adams investigate a disturbing pattern: several young female inmates are mysteriously dying from heart failures or suicides. The investigation leads them to discover that the detention home's staff, led by Dr. Murdock , consists of immoral doctors who have found a way to extend their lives by draining the vital energies from these young women. If they fail to do this, they begin to petrify.",
