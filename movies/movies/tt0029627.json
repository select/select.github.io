The latter, when he finds out, knocks Pete out cold and refuses to have anything to do with him. Pete and Husky are sent on a working party during aerial bombing practice. They board a floating target to repair it and, unknown to the others, Husky is knocked out by a loose timber. Heading back to the ship, Pete discovers that Husky is missing, jumps overboard from the launch and swims back to the target to rescue Husky.",
