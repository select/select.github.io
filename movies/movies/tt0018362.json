      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the final silent films released to star an all African-American cast, this melodrama follows a young lady as she attempts to move on from an abusive and low-income home. While the film was released in 1929, filming was complete by 1927. Modern reviews praise the film for its technique as well as a unique plot.",
