      "description": "Scarlet Street is a 1945 American film noir directed by Fritz Lang . The screenplay concerns two criminals who take advantage of a middle-aged painter in order to steal his artwork. The film is based on the French novel La Chienne (literally The Bitch ) by Georges de La Fouchardière , which had been previously dramatized on stage by André Mouëzy-Éon , and cinematically as La Chienne (1931) by director Jean Renoir . The principal actors Edward G. Robinson , Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea had earlier appeared together in The Woman in the Window (1944), also directed by Lang. Local authorities in New York, Milwaukee, and Atlanta banned Scarlet Street early in 1946 because of its dark plot and themes. The film is in the public domain .",
