It was made at Majestic Studio in Los Angeles in the fall of 1915 . Chaplin played two roles: one as Mr. Pest and one as Mr. Rowdy. The film was created from Chaplin's stage work from a play called Mumming Birds (a.k.a. A Night at an English Music Hall in the United States) with the Karno Company from London. Chaplin performed this play during his U.S. tours with Fred Karno company and decided to bring some of this play to his film work. Edna Purviance played a minor role as a lady in the audience. Plot Mr. Pest tries several theatre seats before winding up in front in a fight with the conductor and, eventually, the entire cast of an evening variety show. The film concludes when a fire eater takes the stage and Chaplin \"heroically\" drenches the performer and the audience with a fire hose. The difference between \"Mr. Pest\" and \"Mr. Rowdy\" appears to be that one is pleasantly drunk and the other is obnoxious and sober.
