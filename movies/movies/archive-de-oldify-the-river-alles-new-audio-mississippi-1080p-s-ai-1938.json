      "description": "A very interesting film about the Mississippi river and life on its banks 84 years ago. This film clearly shows the influence of man. Watch and weep to see how forests and other vegetation were already then being destroyed, resulting in erosion, floods and other devastation. Have we learned anything since? Sadly on the contrary! The original film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, restored, enhanced and colorized with modern video software based on Artificial Intelligence. The original music has been replaced by copyright-free music, leaving the original commentary in tact. Another A.I. was used to achieve this!",
