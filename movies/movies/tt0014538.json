      "title": "Three Ages (1923) | Colorized Public Domain Silent Comedy Classic by Buster Keaton",
      "description": "Three Ages (1923) is an American silent comedy film written, directed, and produced by Buster Keaton in collaboration with Edward F. Cline. Not only does this film mark Keaton’s first feature-length directorial effort, but it also stands as a masterclass in comedic structure and cinematic parody. This restored and colorized edition revives one of Keaton’s most important works, making it more accessible for modern audiences in the United States, Europe, and worldwide.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe film cleverly tells three parallel love stories set in different historical periods: the Stone Age, Ancient Rome, and the Modern Age (1920s America). In each story, Keaton plays a hopeful young man competing for the affection of a woman, only to find himself pitted against a stronger, wealthier rival.\n\nStone Age: Keaton is a bumbling caveman trying to win the heart of a cavewoman (Margaret Leahy) while competing with a brutish rival (Wallace Beery).\n\nAncient Rome: Keaton plays a Roman citizen in pursuit of the same woman, facing challenges from gladiatorial contests and public spectacle.\n\nModern Age: In a 1920s setting, Keaton plays a poor suitor vying for love in a world dominated by money, cars, and social status.\n\nThe three stories unfold simultaneously, intercut with one another, and each concludes with a resolution of the rivalry. True to Keaton’s style, the film is filled with elaborate physical comedy, inventive stunts, and visual gags that highlight his genius for timing and subtle expression.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Directors: Buster Keaton, Edward F. Cline\n• Writers: Buster Keaton, Edward F. Cline\n• Producer: Joseph M. Schenck\n• Cinematography: Elgin Lessley, George Stevens\n• Editing: Buster Keaton\n\nStarring:\n• Buster Keaton as The Lover (in all three ages)\n• Margaret Leahy as The Girl\n• Wallace Beery as The Rival\n• Joe Roberts as Supporting Role\n• Lillian Lawrence as The Girl’s Mother\n\nFilm Significance:\nThree Ages is often described as Buster Keaton’s parody of D.W. Griffith’s Intolerance (1916), which similarly used multiple historical settings to tell interconnected stories. Unlike Griffith’s heavy-handed moralizing, Keaton transforms the technique into a vehicle for comedy, satire, and romance.\n\nThis film is historically important as it launched Keaton into feature-length filmmaking after his successful run of short comedies. It also introduced audiences to his method of blending elaborate stunts with understated humor, a contrast to the broader slapstick of contemporaries like Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplin. Wallace Beery’s performance as the recurring rival adds depth and menace to Keaton’s struggles, while Margaret Leahy provides the romantic center of each story.\n\nAs one of Keaton’s earliest full-length works, Three Ages provides a fascinating look at both his comedic style and the evolution of silent-era storytelling. Its themes of rivalry, love, and perseverance remain timeless, making it a culturally and historically significant piece of cinema.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation. Colorized Public Domain restores and enhances these historic works through careful digital cleaning, visual restoration, and colorization techniques.

By presenting them in color and modern quality, we make them more engaging and accessible to younger generations who might otherwise overlook black-and-white cinema. This process respects the original film while providing a new layer of appreciation for today’s viewers.\n\nWhy Watch This Colorized Edition:\nThe original 1923 release was filmed in black and white, characteristic of silent cinema. While authentic to its time, modern viewers often overlook black-and-white films. By offering a colorized edition, we honor the legacy of Buster Keaton while adapting the film for contemporary viewing habits. This edition makes Three Ages more visually engaging for audiences in the United States, Europe, and beyond, ensuring that Keaton’s pioneering comedy can continue to entertain and inspire.\n\nSubscribe and Explore More Classics:\n📌 Subscribe for more colorized classics: https://www.youtube.com/@ColorizedPublicDomain?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWe upload restored and colorized films from the Golden Age of cinema — comedies, dramas, thrillers, westerns, and more.
