      "description": "Cappy Ricks, a crusty old sea captain, returns home from a long voyage to discover that his family and his business are in chaos--his daughter is set to marry a nitwit that he can't stand, and his future mother-in-law has taken over everything and is set to merge his business with that of a rival company. Worst of all, though, is that she--in the interests of \"progress\"--has completely automated his beloved ship, \"Electra\"!. He sets out to put an end to all this foolishness and comes up with what he thinks is a foolproof plan. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/affairs-of-cappy-ricks-1937/",
