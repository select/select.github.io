      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: Euro War or Macaroni Combat is a sub-genre of war movies produced and directed Europeans, usually Italian. They emerged in the late-1960s, at the time when Italy’s famed Cinecittà Studio was churning out “genre” films, movies made to cash in on and mimic the success of Hollywood blockbusters, in this case, THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967,) GUNS OF NAVARONE (1967,) and KELLY’S HEROES(1970). Another example of this genre available on PizzaFLIX is Umberto Lenzi’s Desert Commandos (1967).\n\nStars: Gianni Garko, Klaus Kinski, Aldo Canti\nDirector: Gianfranco Parolini\n\nJohn Garko is a fun-loving leader of a bunch of oddball G.I.s whose mission is to steal the German's secret attack plans from a villa behind enemy lines, where they run into a brutal Nazi commander.",
