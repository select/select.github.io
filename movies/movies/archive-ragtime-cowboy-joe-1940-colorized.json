      "description": "When a cattle rustler (Dick Curtis) kills a rancher, he accuses a stranger (Johnny Mack Brown) of the crime. But the stranger, who was actually sent by the Cattleman's Protective Association, escapes being lynched, reunites with an old girlfriend (Lynn Merrick), and learns of the scheme to steal the ranch from the dead man's daughter (Nell O'Day). With Fuzzy Knight as the titular cowboy and songs by Captain Bob Crawford and the Texas Rangers. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
