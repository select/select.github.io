      "description": "The women are still wild. The acting is still awful. The plot is still ridiculous. But now you can see it all more clearly and with a much smaller download file. Directed by James L Wolcott. Released in 1958. Filmed in Coral Gables and Silver Springs, FL. Complete print. TRIVIA: Believe it or not Tennessee Williams (uncredited) directed most of this film.",
