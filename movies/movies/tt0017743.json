      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the early full length documentary features, Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness follows a farmer named Kru and his family in what is now northern Thailand as they battle the wilderness. Nominated for an Academy Award and immensely popular at the time of release, Chang has since fallen into obscurity. Modern viewers find the picture incredibly compelling, with compassion and drama throughout. They do note that the actual recorded violence towards animals could be disturbing to some viewers.",

He solves the problems caused by leopards and tigers attacking his stock by setting traps and killing those beasts. A baby chang (the Siamese word for elephant) is caught in his trap, and thinking he would tame it so it will work for him one day, he tethers it to a post under his house, which is on stilts. Its mother comes and destroys his house. Kru and his family flee to the village, where a mammoth herd of elephants suddenly appear and decimates the buildings in the village. But the villagers fight back.",
