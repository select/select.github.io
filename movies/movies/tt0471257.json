    "Plot": "In 1994, a considerable archive of early films from the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon film company was discovered by workmen doing demolition work. The company, founded by founded by Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon in 1897, achieved most of its success filming the hustle-and-bustle of local life and playing it back; by effectively holding up a mirror to their English audiences. In this sense, cinema is being used as a logical extension of the photograph, without narrative, but instead capturing moments in time. 110 years later, these \"captured\" moments are incredible. 'Manchester Street Scene (1901)' is a two-minute snippet of Manchester life, filmed at the corner of Cross Street and Corporation Street. Unlike many early Edison films, the action is unsimulated, and, indeed, it would be nigh impossible to replicate the crisp energy of an entire street going about its day. It's also amusing to watch pedestrians come to a halt upon seeing the motion-picture camera, some staring intently as though waiting for their picture to be taken, others laughing and jostling each other around. 110 years later, at least that hasn't changed; we can't act normal if we know we're being filmed.",
