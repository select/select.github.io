      "description": "An insurance adjuster named Forbes (Dick Powell) hires a private detective named MacDonald (Raymond Burr) to locate Mona (Lizabeth Scott), the girfriend of an embezzler currently in prison, so that he can repossess the expensive gifts she received. Forbes is a family man but is tired of his job and his wife, and he falls hard for the gorgeous Mona. But so has MacDonald, who becomes obsessed with her. MacDonald plots to use the soon-to-be-released embezzler to deal with Forbes, so as to clear the field for himself. Dick Powell as John Forbes Lizabeth Scott as Mona Stevens Jane Wyatt as Sue Forbes Raymond Burr as MacDonald John Litel as District Attorney Byron Barr as Bill Smiley Jimmy Hunt as Tommy Forbes Ann Doran as Maggie This was colorized using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
