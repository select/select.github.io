      "description": "The Colorado Kid ( Bob Steele), foreman at Colonel Gifford's ranch, is arrested for Gifford's murder. His friend Bibben Tucker (Ernie Adams) breaks him out of jail and he goes after the town boss Wolf Hines (Karl Hackett), who he suspects is the real culprit. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
