    "Plot": "A bank president and his wife, facing a crisis in their life and both nearing the age of fifty, look back on what has happened to them over the years of their marriage; they were young people who got married in the average way, lived average lives, raised two sons and realize that most of the incidents in their lives were counterpoint to most people---hard times, salary raises, promotions, loss of a son in war, discharge of social and economic obligations---and the effect of such was a gradual drifting-away from their church and a diminishing importance they gave their religion.",
