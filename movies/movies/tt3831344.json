    "Plot": "When his wife Amelia suffers an aneurysm that leaves her bedridden and slowly dying, police officer Carter Summerland searches for a way to revive her. He's approached by Wesley Enterprises about allowing Amelia to be the test subject for an experimental program that will place her mind in a new, artificial body - and out of desperation, Carter agrees. But is the result really Amelia Summerland? Or is it something else entirely? Set in the very near future, The Summerland Project uses current, existing technology as a launchpad for a story about where the line truly is between life and death, and to ask the question: What is it that makes us human? It explores the motivations behind the team that creates Amelia, from genius but standoffish Dr. Ellen Beckett to the kind yet arrogant industrialist Paul Wesley, who funds the work. It explores the fallout in the scientific, legal and religious community, with opposition to the project spearheaded by the passionate Senator Williams. But most importantly, it explores the struggle of Amelia herself, who tries to understand what's happened to her, whether she is still human, and whether she'll ever be able to return to the life she once knew - even as those around her question whether she has a right to that life at all.",
