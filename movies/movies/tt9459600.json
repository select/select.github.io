      "description": "A selection of some of the earliest silent films. They are unidentified, but the first, The Car, looks like it came from Melies while the second, The Derby, is probably from the Lumiere Brothers. There is a paper print from Edison, and a very telling shot of Tsar Nicholas and entourage parading in front of the peasants in 1911. His days were numbered at that time.",
