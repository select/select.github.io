      "description": "A filmed performance (in CinemaScope) of the highly popular Broadway hit that was basically a collection of skits, sketches, songs and dances built around a flimsy plot to meld them all together which, for the most part, worked. The plot involves a performer/producer (Ronny Graham)who finds himself in financial difficulties on the eve of opening night because a big check is needed before the curtain can go up. But a wealthy Texan says he will put up the money, if his daughter is in the show and he can see it first. End of plot, but the beginning of the careers of some young and talented people who have had careers across many decades. Ertha Kitt sings four songs, including \"C'est Si Bon\" and \"Santa Baby\" in and around some funny skits; \"Trip of the Month\", \"Snake Charmer\", \"Crazy Man\" and \"Oedipus Goes South.\" Graham and Mel Brooks (in his Melvin Brooks days)are credited with most of the sketch material and just the title of the \"Oedipus\" bit suggests Brooks. There is a burlesque of \"Death of a Salesman\", which was probably the easiest to write of all. It also appears that when Brooks later did \"The Producers\", he hadn't forgotten everything about \"New Faces.\" Written by Les Adams",
