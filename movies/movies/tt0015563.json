Soon she has the hens striking for \"shorter hours\" and \"smaller eggs\". Alice and Julius need to fill an urgent egg order. They spot two roosters fighting. They organize a pugilistic event, and charge each hen one egg admission. Alice and Julius fill their order and drive away ... but the load slips off, breaking all the eggs.",
