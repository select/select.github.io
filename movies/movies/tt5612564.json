    "Plot": "IMITATION GIRL is the lyrical telling of a mysterious being who arrives on Earth in the shape of a young woman. Taken in by Iranian immigrants, a brother and sister living in the American Southwest, Imitation forms an understanding of the strange species around her, and as she learns more about her new body and her companions, she comes to appreciate the beauty and the sadness of her new world. At the same time, Julianna, Imitation's world-wise, world-weary earthly double, knows both glitz and grit working as an entertainer in New York City, where her fraying life and relationships now threaten her preparations for the dream audition that might finally set her on a happier path. On learning of Julianna's existence, Imitation heads to New York, where only by sacrificing themselves to each other can the cosmic twins complete their portrait of a woman and find fulfillment.",
