      "description": "This early Mighty Mouse cartoon -- actually, he was still called 'Super Mouse' at this point -- is one of the better ones, due to the large number of good comedy gags inserted -- cats hiding behind skinny trees, mice running down cats' gullets and into their tails, and so forth.
