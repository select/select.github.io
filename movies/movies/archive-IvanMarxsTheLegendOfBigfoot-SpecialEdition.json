      "description": "A painstakingly researched, enhanced and extended cut of Ivan Marx controversial documentary. More informative and a good bit creepier than the original cut. Marx encounters a small female sasquatch, ancient American Indian markings, witnesses who have encountered mysterious \"U.F.O.s\"and headless creatures with glowing eyes, which would later come to be known as \"Mothmen\". Some say Marx was far ahead of his time. Some say he was a fraud. You be the judge!!",
