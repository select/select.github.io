    "Plot": "The desk sergeant, in dress uniform, takes a call from the chief. Three colleagues enter and he tells them that the chief wants them over at the orphanage to perform. They practice four numbers in barbershop quartet harmony: \"Skinna-Ma Rink-A-Dink\" is followed by something the kids will enjoy - a Mother Goose medley of four nursery rimes sung simultaneously - \"Little Jack Horner\" (alto), \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\" (tenor), \"Little Bo Peep\" (baritone), and \"Pease Porridge\" (bass). Next is a medley of \"Cluckin'\" and \"You Tell Me Your Dream.\" They conclude with the ragtime \"Waddle\" and a bow.",
