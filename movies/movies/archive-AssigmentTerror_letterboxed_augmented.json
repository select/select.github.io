      "description": "AKA Dracula Vs. Frankenstein This is the version avilible here, but with a few tweaks. I altered the title sequenc e to fit the rest of the titles. I enhanced the sound, and lightened the pirnt a bit. Also, this is the French version, so it has more scenes than the AKA version Dracula Vs, Frankenstein (Also avilible here in fullscreen.) What a sad film for poor Micheal Rennie (THe Day The Earth Stood Still) to finish his career on.",
