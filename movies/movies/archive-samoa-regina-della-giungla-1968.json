      "description": "Yet another Edwige Fenech movie. This time she plays a jungle girl and much like Evelyne Kraft in Goliathon her costume barely fits her. Femi Benussi also appears in the film which has something to do with Europeans trying to steal diamonds from the locals.  There are the usual badly staged attacks by trained tigers, stock footage of African natives inserted to lend authenticity even though the film was shot in Italy and shots of what is probably Victoria Falls.  Optional English subs,",
