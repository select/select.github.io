High school student James Young (Gregory Ley) sells his soul over the internet for a little extra spending money. But when it is purchased by a company known as Wholesale Souls, Inc., James tries to track down and buy it back. After frustrating encounters with Wholesale Souls, Inc. executive Stan McReynolds (Stan McReynolds), a man who may or may not be Satan incarnate, James grows increasingly paranoid and his relationship with his friends (Evan Riffe, Arin Baun, Erin Ray, Micah Buchele-Collins) becomes strained. Surrounded more and more by hallucinatory suspicions and personal tragedy, James makes a decision that will change his life and the lives of his friends forever.",
