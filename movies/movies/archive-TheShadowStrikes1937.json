      "description": "The Shadow Strikes * 1937 This is Lamont Cranston, aka The Shadow. It stars Rod La Rocque and Agnes Anderson. Margo Lane is absent; and the Shadow character lacks the supernatural ability that makes him fun; but it's not a bad whodunnit. There are some funny bits, and some people think of it as a comedy. More information can be found on IMDB The source for this upload can be found elsewhere on archive.org. I cleaned up the audio and decided to share it back to this site.",
