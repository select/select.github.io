    "Plot": "I go to YouTube everyday because of the many rarities that happen to be on this site like the short film I'm reviewing right now. It's a series of unusual dissolve shots of the city (presumably New York) done to make the impossible look possible like the way cars and trains seem to go through each other in thin air. The trick photography is done by one Alvin Knechtel with various film stock whether black &amp; white or blue tinted. The music that was added years later is by Brian Robison who provides what sounds like perfect period music of the film's timeline that just makes one marvel at the completeness of it all. Once again, I have to thank YouTube and other similar sites for this discovery since I don't think I'd even know about this otherwise...",
