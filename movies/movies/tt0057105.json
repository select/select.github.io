      "description": "http://imdb.com/title/tt0057105/ Another spaghetti and sandal flick, this time with Cameron Mitchell desperate for work. Very loose version of Caesar's Commentaries. May appear choppy at times, due to conversion from a 24-fps QT. Not recommended for downloading by whiners -instead, better upload your own higher quality version.",

Vercingetorix has rallied many tribes to his cause, including one led by the beautiful Queen Asterix and others who'd once pledged allegiance to Rome. At first things go badly for the Romans, complicated by the fact that Vercingetorix has captured and tortured a centurion named Claudius Valerius who's in love with Caesar's ward, Publia, who has also fallen into the hands of Vercingetorix. Eventually a great battle pitting Caesar against the rebellious Gaul decides the fate of all concerned.",
