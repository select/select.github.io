      "description": "Live action version of anime. Yuya has a new stepsister named Mitsuki and shortly after the family moves in together, she is haunted by a ghost. The ghost, Hiyori, often takes over Misuki's body and there is a chastity belt for some reason.  Gets surprisingly graphic though being of Japanese pedigree, the nasty bits are all blurred.  Japanese with optional English subtitles",
