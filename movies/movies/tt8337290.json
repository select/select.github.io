      "description": "What is a priest to do when one of his students, within the privacy of the confessional, admits to multiple murders? Benji is the boarding school’s “golden boy,” both in the classroom and on the playing field; Dyson is just the opposite. But they have one thing in common: hatred of their form master, Fr. Goddard.They torment him by falsely confessing to increasingly outrageous sins (knowing that the “seal of confession” forbids Goddard from punishing them and thus revealing what he knows). Benji eventually confesses to murdering the drifter Blakey and burying the body in the woods. Or has he? Later, Benji confesses to murdering again. Did he? After all, it’s right around the time that Dyson vanishes from the school grounds…How can Fr. Goddard separate fact from fiction without revealing Benji’s confessions? Fr. Goddard: Richard Burton; Benji: Dominic Guard; Dyson: David “Dai” Bradley; Blakey: Billy Connolly (yes, the banjo-pickin’ comedian – who plays it straight). Written by Anthony Shaffer (“Sleuth”)",
