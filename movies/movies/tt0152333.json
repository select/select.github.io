    "Plot": "Scrappy ges a Saint Bernard and drags it home from the pet shop. He introduces the huge beast to his parrot, Pete, and leaves them to get acquainted. Of course they have a comic battle.Pete is an interesting-looking character, since he wears pants and a belt -- none of this stuff that got Donald Duck banned in Sweden. He also has a pair of dueling pistols that can fire dozens of balls, one after the other, when he loses his temper, which he does immediately. The Saint Bernard, in contrast, is the immense, slow thinking creature that reminds me of the Saint Bernard of a friend from half a century ago.It's all very amusing, even thugh it goes nowhere. Perhaps that's one of the reasons it's so funny.",
