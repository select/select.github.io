      "description": "When a murderous gang kidnaps the government's best engraver and forces him to make counterfeit money, the Secret Service sends its best agents (two-fisted Jack Holt and feisty Evelyn Brent) to infiltrate the gang and track down its leader (John Ward) by following his chief henchmen (Tris Coffin and Ted Adams). But a rival gangster (Joe McGuinn) foils all their plans. Holt gets occasional assistance from a fellow agent (Edward Hearn). 15 chapters. Strangely, actor Jack Holt plays a character named Jack Holt. But then Jack Holt spends the entire serial pretending to be an escaped criminal named Nick Farrell. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
