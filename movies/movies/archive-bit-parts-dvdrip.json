      "description": "A plastic surgeon has badly injured his daughter in a car accident. In order to make her look \"perfect\", he lures unsuspecting young actresses to an abandoned warehouse, kills them, and put their \"perfect\" feature (like a nose) on his daughter's face. When Brenda's sister turns up missing, she comes to Los Angeles to find her.",
