    "Plot": "Krazy Kat is washed ashore on an island by a giant fish. He finds himself among cannibals. They have a night club where he is to be served as a main course. It is a Cotton Club dance club and it is inhabited by stereotypical black people. They look pretty much like monkeys. Krazy attempts to save his life by playing music with them. Once again, the cartoon is used to promote music. Here it is the Cab Calloway stuff. The animation is quite good, and once again, instruments have a life of their own. Still, it's amazing that Blacks have come as far as they have considering the deplorable depiction of them that was Hollywood. They are musically talented and incredibly stupid. How sad that the music was embraced and, yet, the people who produced it so minimalized.",
