      "description": "She Done Him Wrong is a 1933 pre-Code American crime/comedy film starring Mae West and Cary Grant. The plot includes melodramatic and musical elements, with a supporting cast featuring Owen Moore, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery Sr., Rochelle Hudson, and Louise Beavers. It was directed by Lowell Sherman, and produced by William LeBaron. The film is famous for West's many double entendres and quips, including her best-known (and frequently misquoted), \"Why don't you come up sometime and see me?\" The film was adapted from the successful 1928 Broadway play Diamond Lil by Mae West. The Hays Code declared the play banned from the screen and repeatedly demanded changes to remove associations with or elements from the play, including suggested titles with the word \"diamond\". The adaption was finally allowed under the condition that the play not be referred to in publicity or advertising.",
