    "Plot": "Waffles the Cat and Don Dog set out on an adventure to find the North Pole - which is a physical object that looks like a barber pole. Their dog sled comes to an abrupt stop when a rabbit stands in the way. The aggressive bunny slaps the face of the lead dog, which causes the dogs to fight amongst themselves and then run off into the distance, taking sled and supplies with them. Poor Waffles and Don are alone in the frozen wilderness with only a seltzer bottle filled with liquor to keep them warm. Meanwhile, the native wildlife sing and dance. Seals, polar bears, penguins and walruses enjoy themselves with musical merriment.",
