    "Plot": "The usual gang of small Terrytoon animal characters is down at Joe's lunch diner when in walks a tough racketeer who eats all the food and demands to know who supplies the baked goods in this decent Terrytoons.I have never really enjoyed Terrytoons, since they were aimed at small children -- even when I was a small child, I far preferred Loony Tunes and Precode Fleischer. There is certainly no denying the competence of Terry's staff in this period, with a goodly assortment of gags at a good pace. Nonetheless, there are no characters that stand out. They are all utility comics, capable of a good job, but nothing to make a particular effort noteworthy. And this cartoon is another of that breed.",
