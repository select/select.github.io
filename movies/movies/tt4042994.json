      "description": "A 30-year-old postman learns that he doesn't have much time left to live due to a terminal illness. He is plagued by a constant headache, visits a doctor and is told that he has a brain tumour. A devil then appears in front of him and offers to extend his life if he picks something in the world that will disappear from his life. The man thinks about his relationships with ex-friends, ex-lovers, relatives and colleagues who will be sincerely sad when he dies. As the phone disappears; so does the memory of his girlfriend, with the movie; his friend, the watch; his father... In this fantasy human drama, a man struggles with the conflict of erasing his own existence, or his love, friends and family. (Source: MyDramaList) ~~ Adapted from the novel \"If Cats Disappeared from the World\" (世界から猫が消えたなら) by Kawamura Genki (川村元気). ",
