      "description": "This very interesting footage about old London has been colorized using a new method. Later in this film we go deeper in to this. In this film we in particular see what transport in London was like a century ago in 1924. Already many buses and taxis roamed the streets starting by showing a very busy Fleet Street with St.Pauls cathedral in the background, and where many newspapers reside. The first buses appeared on London's streets just after 1900. Until 1933, when the \"London Transport\" company was formed, the number of public transport companies were skattered all over London. Many were privately owned. From 1908 onwards some consolidation started. Many markets occupied London's streets like shown in this film on Tower Bridge Road. A Galeries LaFayette store at Regents Street can been seen. This store came over from Paris France in 1905. It was closed in 1972 and since then it is occupied by the well known Hamleys toy store. Another great shot shows The Strand looking towards St Mary le Strand church, followed by many more buses at St. George's hospital The penultimate scene shows many buses on their way to and from Knightsbridge. This part-1 of our short London films about old London in 1924 ends at Broadway in the city of Westminster. For those who prefer B&W footage the same A.I. enhanced film is subsequently shown again without added colour. Normally restoring and colorizing historic footage takes me about 1 hour per minute of film. This new method takes about 10 times longer but is certainly worth it. It is based on manually colorizing reference frames for each scene. The manual colorization itself often takes over an hour per reference frame. The A.I. keeps track of the colors of all objects, but degrades over time such that new colorized reference frames are needed. The degradation depends on the complexity of the scene and how fast a scene changes. The film ends with a side-by-side comparison of the original footage next to our colorized result.",
