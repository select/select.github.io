      "description": "The title, is Probably an Americanization of the French, Les Mousquetaire de Pigalle, This is one of the better Griffith shorts. Made in 1913, it has a lovely performance by Lilian Gish which should remind you why she became a great star. Harry Cary who later did unbelievable stunts for John Ford and other Western directors is also in the picture. He is the tough looking gang member. Notice the interesting crowd scenes in the alley and on the street where every member of the crowd has a part to play. With Griffith pictures, always look fr the AB which protects their copyright. Also notice the clear suggestion of corruption in the police at the end.",
