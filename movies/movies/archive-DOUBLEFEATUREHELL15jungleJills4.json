      "description": "Welcome to the fourth insomniac double feature dedicated to ladies of the leaf litter. Any similarity to actual persons living or dead is a shame. The back lot, stock footage and Bronson Canyon adventures begin with a coming attraction and a cartoon. Then Irish McCalla starrs in the low-budget jaw-dropper “She Demons.” The intermission short is chapter 2 of “Panther Girl of the Congo” with Phyllis Coates. Then a hand mirror lures cutie-pie Rochelle Hudson onto captivity in “The Savage Girl,” and yes there’s a guy in a gorilla suit. ",
