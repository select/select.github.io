    "Plot": "Dick Huemer gives Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Match Girl\" his own over-the-top take, four years before his compeers would return with a serious, Oscar-nominated version.This being Dick Huemer's cartoon, all stops are let out and there is an immense amount of detail work to buttress the work's absurdity. Oopie cannot sell his matches and returns home where an ugly brute demands dinner. Every barbed hair on the villain's chin is carefully delineated and all seems hopeless until Scrappy shows up to save the day.If some of the Scrappy cartoons are weak, it is because for some reason there is frequently only four minutes' worth of material for a six-minute cartoon. That is certainly not the case here.",
