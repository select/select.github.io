    "Plot": "When the lions get loose at the circus, it's up to Mighty Mouse to beat up on the big cats in this bog standard Terrytoon.I don't think that Paul Terry's organization knew what to do with their break-out star character. Every time he appeared he had to beat up cats. That's what his audience of small children seemed to want. With this one, they eke it out by having mice listen to the story on the radio. This makes it clear that Mighty Mouse is derived from Superman. Yet while the Superman comic could do all sorts of stories and the radio show actually would be instrumental in fighting the Ku Klux Klan, Mighty Mouse just beat up on cats. Every time.It's not that they didn't try. They tried to ornament the story. They used their top-of-the-line animation. They varied the setting and the details of the mice MM would save from cats. They would use alley cats, lions and cats with bat wings. But it always wound up the same.",
