    "Plot": "Man's vocation is not always one of choice, it is more often one of circumstances. This story illustrates the fallacy of parents selecting, without regard to the natural inclination or ability of the child, a line of pursuit or means of livelihood, which accounts for the large number of dismal failures in life. In this instance the father of John Wallace, prompted by his religious fervor, urges the boy to enter a monastery. John obligingly acquiesces and starts on the journey, but later changes his mind, seeks employment on a farm and subsequently marries. Old man Wallace often meditates about his boy and watches the pilgrimages of the padres, hoping to get a glimpse of his son. John finally visits his father, in company with his wife and child. The disappointment of the father is intense, but the sight of his grandchild softens his heart and he yields to nobler sentiment.",
