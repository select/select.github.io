    "Plot": "The old soldier's little daughter has two persistent suitors. One, a manly fellow, who tells the girl she will marry him in spite of all. Her other suitor is a good-natured, shiftless chap, whose weaknesses are booze and music, he being the village fiddler. He tries to get the lead on his neighbor by presenting her with a mammoth pumpkin. He thinks this little attention should win her, but she has met and become interested in a young stranger from the big city, who is hunting and fishing in these hills. The fiddler, despairing, plays soulfully on his violin, thinking the strains may soften her heart. They do, but for the other fellow, with whom she consents to elope. Her manly friend prevents this, however, by driving the city fellow away. The girl realizes the error of her intentions and accepts her mountain knight, just as the fiddler arrives to renew his suit, aided by the pumpkin. He might have exclaimed, \"Well, I'll be darned,\" but he simply ejaculates, \"Oh! Pumpkins!\"",
