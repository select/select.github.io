    "Plot": "This script rode in right off of the range that had been ridden at least twice by Tim McCoy at Columbia. Writer Elmam did little other than moving it from a Western to a big-town Eastern. Don Castle plays a newly-elected district attorney but, just before he takes office, the town's crooked political boss (Edward Keane) has his henchies (including Jeff Chandler)kidnap him with intentions of replacing him with an ex-convict(Don Castle in a dual role) who is his exact double. While the D.A.'s double/replacement is studying his mannerisms where he is being held captive, the D.A. knocks out the double, takes his clothes and manages to fool the gang boss into thinking he is the ex-con. The henchies then kill the ex-con thinking he is the D.A. The latter continues to impersonate his double until he has set and sprung the trap on the gang boss and his minions. Peggy Knudsen plays the D.A's. fiance, Patricia Knight the wife of the ex-con and Joe Sawyer pops up as a crooked police official.",
