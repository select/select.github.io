It caused so much laughter you couldn't hear what the actors was talkin'. Charles Chaplin was the leading fun maker.\" [ 3 ] A reviewer for the New York Dramatic Mirror wrote, \"Superlatives are dangerous epithets, especially when dealing with pictures. For that reason it is unwise to call this the funniest picture that has ever been produced, but it comes mighty close to it.\" [ citation needed ] References 1 Walker, Brent E. (2010).
