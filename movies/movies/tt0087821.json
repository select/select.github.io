      "description": "The film is about the interconnection of events that, at first glance, mean nothing, but in fact have an impact on the lives of complete strangers. The viewer is immersed in the flow of travel in space and time. There is no one main character or a single narrative outline, there is no plot in the usual sense of the word. This film is a reflection of life, where people’s destinies intersect in a bizarre way, creating on the screen the image of Russia in the late 90s. Each character carries his own story, his own unsolved secret - like a passerby on the street whom you noticed and immediately lost from sight forever.\n\nYear of production: 1998\n\nDirector: Shakhnazarov Karen\nWriters: Alexander Borodyansky, Karen Shakhnazarov\nComposer: Anatoly Kroll\nOperator: Karyuk Gennady\nProduction designer: Kusakova Lyudmila\n\nCast: Ilyin Vladimir, Fateeva Natalya, Sukhov Fedor, Koreneva Elena, Storozhik Valery, Germ Anna, Panin Andrey, Stychkin Evgeny, Priemykhov Valery, Vasilyeva Nadezhda, Zotov Vasily, Tsygankov Andrey, Chindyaykin Nikolay, Shevchenkov Alexey, Yankovsky Philip, Anisimova Galina , Afanasyev Valery, Sinyakina Anna",
