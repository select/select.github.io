    "Plot": "This is a very entertaining British murder mystery. The plot concerns a gang of four jewel thieves, led by Diana Napier, who steal two highly valuable diamonds out of a set of earrings. Napier sells them to a dishonest businessman (Willoughby Goddard) at his country estate, but the gang plans to return later and steal them back. However, Goddard's long-lost half-brother (John Benley) suddenly returns to the estate accompanied by his new fiancée (Patricia Owens). Bentley wants to claim his half of the inheritance, but soon discovers that his half-brother has squandered the family fortune and is now engaged in buying and selling stolen gems. He confronts Goddard, who panics, and hits Bentley over the head with a poker. As he is about to strike a death blow, a shot rings out and Goddard falls dead. The police arrest Bentley for the murder but soon have to release him for lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Patricia Owens tries to find the real killer by playing up to one of the members of the gang, who happens to be an old boyfriend of hers. The best scenes in the movie occur when Diana Napier pulls a gun on Patricia Owens and ties her hands behind her back. Later, while tied hand and foot and gagged, Patricia manages to stand up and hop to a table where she grabs a telephone by its cord. She then hops across the room and is able to hurl the telephone through a glass window to attract attention and get help. Eventually, John Bentley comes up with a plan to lure the gang to the mansion and expose the real killer. There is a neat plot twist and surprise at then end of the movie. It is definitely worth watching, especially for mystery fans.",
