      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time, with her books selling over 2 billion copies! Christie’s \"And Then There Were None“ has been adapted to film over a dozen times, but our 1945 version is widely considered the iconic one to watch.\n\nStars: Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Roland Young, and many more!\nDirector: Rene Clair\nIn Agatha Christie's classic mystery, ten people are invited to an isolated island. While they wait for their mysterious host to appear, the guests begin to be murdered. Could one of them be the killer? This version is an adaptation from Christie's successful stage play, not of her novel, Ten Little Indians, and the most glaring difference is what happens in the last few minutes.\nTRIVIA: Richard Haydn, who plays the Butler, also did the voice of the Caterpillar in Disney's \"Alice in Wonderland.\"",
