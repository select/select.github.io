      "description": "Abel Ferrara began filming Driller Killer in 1977 and finished the film in 1978, but it was not released until 1979. Then in 1982 the UK distributors of the film, Vipco, took out some full-page advertisements in a number of movie magazines. The advertisements showed the video's violently explicit cover, complaints began flooding into the Advertising Standards Agency, and by 1984 'Video Nasties' were banned in the UK.
