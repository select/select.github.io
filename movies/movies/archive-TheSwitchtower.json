      "description": "The Switchtpwer 0r Saved by their Son was directed by Anthony O'Sullivan in 1913. Arogant tramps, a railroad man , counterfeiters, detectives and a boy to the rescue. How could you ask for more in about 10 minutes The switchman is played, by the way, by henry B Warthall who later starred in Birth of an Nation. I found this film under D W Griffith films and first listed it as such. It certainly looks like Griffith and includes a number of his regular players, but I bow to Wikileaks and IMBD",
