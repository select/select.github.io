      "description": "Four soldiers-two Germans ( Maximilian Schell , Marlon Brando ) and two Americans ( Montgomery Clift , Dean Martin )-experience the horrors of World War II. Brando made his character more sympathetic than Irwin Shaw 's original book intended. Because of these and other changes, the author distanced himself from the film adaptation. Nevertheless, it remains a multifaceted portrayal of the war years.",
