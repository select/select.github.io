      "description": "Martha Proctor (Aline MacMahon) feels that something sinister has come to her home when her nephew, Dr. Dan Proctor (Scott McKay), arrives with his frail fiancée, Evelyn Heath (Anne Baxter). Tensions rise as Evelyn, hiding her true intentions, begins to manipulate those around her, particularly her future brother-in-law, Douglas (Ralph Bellamy). As Evelyn’s behavior creates conflict between the Proctor family members, secrets begin to unravel, and suspicions grow. With the atmosphere growing increasingly tense, it’s unclear just how far Evelyn is willing to go to achieve her desires—until an unexpected turn leaves the household on the brink of disaster.\n\nColorized version https://youtu.be/C0Zr6PMjDBU\n\n\nDirectors: John Brahm, Lewis Milestone,\nWriters: Ketti Frings, Hagar Wilde \nStars: Anne Baxter, Ralph Bellamy, Aline MacMahon\nGenres: Classics, Drama, Film-Noir\n\n\n@CultCinemaClassics  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdZ0h0ouY9tWI-vfLlRO1Nt2",
