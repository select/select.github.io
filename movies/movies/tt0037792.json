    "Plot": "A young Frank Sinatra is in the studio with a full orchestra. He records a take of \"If You Are But a Dream,\" then breaks for a smoke. From the studio, he steps into an alley where he sees nearly a dozen kids chasing one smaller boy. Frank stops them, asks why, and they tell him it's because of the boy's religion. So Frank asks them if they're Nazis and explains a few things about America, blood banks, World War II, and teamwork. Then he sings \"The House I Live In\" for them. Off the lads scamper, and the kid Frank's saved gives him a look of gratitude.",
