      "description": "An extensive interview originally broadcast in Feb. 1979. Host David Susskind and Truman Capote discuss the icon's history, his writing, his social persona and impact. More than an interview, the wide-ranging conversation between longtime friends delves into topics you are unlikely to see elsewhere.\n\nIn this candid 1979 interview from The David Susskind Archives, Truman Capote offers a sharp, witty, and unapologetic glimpse into his life as a literary icon and socialite. Capote addresses controversies—including media misrepresentation of his behavior, fallout from his unfinished novel Answered Prayers, and his infamous Studio 54 escapades—while defending his lifestyle and artistic choices. He reflects on friendships with figures like Andy Warhol, Jackie Kennedy, and Barbara Paley, critiques societal envy, and shares anecdotes about plastic surgery, health, and his love of nightlife. Capote’s trademark humor and candor shine as he dissects fame, wealth, and the complexities of human relationships, revealing both vulnerability and defiance. A revealing portrait of a writer navigating the highs and lows of public life.",
