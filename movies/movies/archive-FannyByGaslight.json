      "description": "“Pioneering, innovating film” “Very engrossing” “Part Dickens, part soap opera” “Entertaining” “Overblown Gainsborough gloop” (IMDB reviews quotes). Victorian romantic melodrama with a plot too risque for the prudish Hayes Office censors. It was banned in the US until 1948. Good cast and good period-piece production. IMDB rating 6.6. Directed by Anthony Asquith. UK release 1944. US release 1948. Complete print. A. K.A. “Man of Evil”",
