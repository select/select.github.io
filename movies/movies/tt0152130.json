    "Plot": "Van Beuren cartoons are extremely variable, especially in the number of gags and whether the absurdist humour shines through enough (sometimes it does, other times it doesn't), but are strangely interesting. Although they are often poorly animated with barely existent stories and less than compelling lead characters, they are also often outstandingly scored, there can be some fun support characters and some are well-timed and amusing.While Van Beuren have done worse overall, for me 'Rag Dog' is one of the worst of their \"Rainbow Parade\" cartoons (27 in the series overall and a mixed bag). Not without redeeming qualities and not a complete waste of time, but it just didn't do anything for me. Saw it really as somebody who is trying to see as many Van Beuren cartoons as possible, so that is pretty much the main reason to see it.There are strengths certainly. Quite liked the animation, which has come on a lot since (human) Tom and Jerry and Cubby the Bear. Despite the character drawing lacking refinement and some garishness which does give off a primitive feel, the colours appeal generally to the eye while the backgrounds are elaborate and meticulous. Even better is the music score, it is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. Some of the synchronisation is sharp enough. The very interestingly animated, through rotoscope, dogs are very easy to root for, mainly because the three kittens are so annoying to make 'Rag Dog' near unbearable at its worst.'Rag Dog' suffers from a lot of things, and with complaints common in the \"Rainbow Parade\" series. The content is pretty thin, not much to it, and not only are there not enough gags as such but any absurdist humour or surrealism present in some of Van Beuren's earlier work is completely absent. The cartoon is too saccharine and very cutesy in characterisation, some of the sugar excessive.Only liked the dogs here. Hated the obnoxious and overly-cute and bratty kittens, and the conflict was just too predictable, brutal, anaemic and pointless. The story is non-existent with little in terms of events and conflict to be engaged by, and the pace never really comes to life.To conclude, the animation, music and dogs save this mediocre cartoon from being completely unbearable. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
