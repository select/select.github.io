      "description": "This public domain film is a film noir involving a female undercover detective who is gathering evidence about some wealthy smugglers.  It has some suspense and the obligatory fight scene.  Restoration was by J. Clement.  Unfortunately the original transfer was botched so it was not possible to restore the result to the original 24 frames/sec.  This results in some judder and flashing during pans. The cast includes: Preston Foster Irene Hervey Walter Woolf King Frank Jenks Fred Keating Regis Toomey Clay Clement Frances Robinson Raymond Parker Milburn Stone Doris Rankin Harry Hayden",
