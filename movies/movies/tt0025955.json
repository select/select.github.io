      "description": "PLEASE VISIT THE RUSS COLUMBO SOCIETY AT russcolumbo.org TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN TO HAVE RUSS COLUMBO AWARDED A STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME. THANK YOU. Wake Up and Dream was part of a concerted (and successful) effort to turn radio crooner Russ Columbo into a major movie star. The story is the old saw about a trio of vaudevillians, Paul (Columbo), Charley (Roger Pryor) and Toby (June Knight), who have a falling out when both Paul and Charley fall in love with Toby. The girl is indecisive, but she comes to the conclusion that Paul is the man for her. By this time, however, Paul is convinced that Toby is crazy about Charley, and he tries to bring the two of them together.
