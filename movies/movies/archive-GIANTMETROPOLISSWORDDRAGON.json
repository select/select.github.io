      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu with a photo from the movies and drive-in style audio. SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the .zip, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. But I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be seen here on the site. This disc contains the movies THE GIANT OF MARATHON & THE SWORD AND THE DRAGON, as well as the preview and intermission reels laid out to play like an old drive-in show.",
