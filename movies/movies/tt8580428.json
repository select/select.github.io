Tasked with reaching the most northeastern point of Eurasia and putting the vast Arctic territories on the world maps were their main purpose in life. Even when their crew is faced with deadly storms, severe northern frosts, and hunger, they remain determined to let nothing stop them. \"The First\" is an incredible story about loyalty, faith, and honor!\n\n2018 | Stars: Nail Abdrakhmanov, Evgeniy Tkachuk, Alina Lanina\n*Licensed from ITN.
