      "description": "The 2am Theater scraped the very bottom of its film vault to come up with this 3rd and final jungle jills insominac double feature. No stock footage animals were harmed during its assembly. This safari into the forbidden lands of phony leopard skins begins with previews of comming distractions followed by the adventures of prehistoric Florida magazine models in \"The Wild Women of Wongo,\" It's followed by \"Bowanga Bowanga\" a sociological study of the cultural mores and group dynamics of white women in Southern California pretending to be in Africa, and there's a guy in a gorilla suit. SPECIAL NOTE: For those with less than chronic insomnia, \"The Wild Women of Wongo\" and \"Bowanga Bowanga\" (a.k.a. \"Wild Women\") are also available as separate items in the Picfixer Feature Film Collection.
