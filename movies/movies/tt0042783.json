    "Plot": "After countless hours of rehearsal to perfect their routines and years of struggling to get bookings, dance duo Guy Richards and Carol Williams, who are also an offstage couple. are enjoying enough success on the nightclub circuit to make longer-term plans, like imminent marriage. Then Carol falls ill, is taken to the hospital, and is diagnosed with polio. The prognosis is good: with hard work and patience she might be able to walk again, and there's a even a slim possibility that she might dance again. She is admitted to an institution that specializes in rehabilitation for polio patients. Beyond Carol's and Guy's fears for her overall health, they still might not last as a couple, although they love each other, because of feelings of guilt and resentment about Carol's illness; also, Carol feels inferior, only being able to associate with people who are like her. Only true role models may be able to show both Carol and Guy that they can lead a happy life together.",
