In the world of BloodSpell, some people are infected with magic in their blood. When that blood is spilled, the magic is released, to harm or heal. When Jered, a young monk trained to hunt the Blooded, realises he has magic in his own blood, he must flee into the slums and magical hideouts of the Blooded, pursued by the Church of the Angels who trained him. \"There's some damned fine storytelling and editing/production work here\" - Cory Doctorow, author and blogger \"Blood, Angels and loads of vicious smiting: what more could you ask for?\" - Alan Campbell, author of Scar Night. \"\"A movie that defies most of the rules of traditional film-making.\" - The Guardian What should I download?
