      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This romance comedy was one of the earliest color films by Warner Bros. Unfortunately, the color version has been lost except for a small segment. Still, the film was nominated for an Oscar for best art direction, and was a massive box office success, so it had positives beyond just color to sustain it. ",

At the restaurant, she meets Blair, and they both fall for each other, but Blair is engaged to Marcia. Sally is hired to impersonate a famous Russian dancer named Noskerova, but at that engagement, she is found to be a phony and that Blair is engaged.
