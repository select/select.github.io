    "Plot": "One of the poorer of the Fleischer Brothers' cartoons, this suffers from a hackneyed plot -- no one likes the hero because of something that he is not responsible for (in this case, being a smelly onion) until it turns out that they need him (in this case, various fruits and vegetables) for rescue from an evil menace (in this case a caterpillar that looks a lot like a dragon from a Betty Boop cartoon half a decade earlier). Then joy and acceptance: now they like him because the caterpillar might come back and we need him, so put up with the stench.On top of that, it's one of the most poorly drawn Fleischers, with no fluidity of line -- although that might be an artifact of the print.",
