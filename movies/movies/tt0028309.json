    "Plot": "The previous comment seems to refer to a totally DIFFERENT film, apparently the 1938 SOVIET Russian, very modern musical comedy \"Volga-Volga,\" directed by Grigori Aleksandrov and starring his wife Lyubov Orlova as \"Strelka\" (not \"Stalka\" or some other distorted name). Whereas this film, \"Stjenka Rasin\" [\"Stenka Razin\" is the more familiar transliteration to English] was a FASCIST German film about an 17th-century uprising of peasants against the Tsarist Russian establishment. Razin, the leader of the uprising, died in 1671, during the reign of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich (father of Peter the Great). \"Stjenka Rasin\" featured German actors and was directed by an anti-Soviet émigré Alexandre Volkoff. Thus two totally different subjects, two totally different films. -- Prof Steven P Hill, Russian and Cinema, University of Illinois.",
