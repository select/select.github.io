    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie sneak into the New York Auto Show to look at the new cars. Then they go home and build their own auto from bath tubs and sausages. Will they be the hit of the show?Dick Huemer invented Scrappy and directed the cartoons for a couple of years before he moved on. Scrappy, as he was drawn, was a caricature of a child whose world was a child's world. After Huemer left, that continued, but then it went downhill. Before it had been erratic, often with a great start and a dull finish. But under Huemer, the world was Scrappy's, a world that a child might believe he lived in. Huemer might have fun with that, but he never talked down to his audience in this children's series. Looking at this one. It's fantasy as soon as Scrappy and Oopie begin building their car, but there is no sense that Huemer is looking down at these kids, laughing at them for their naïveté. That's what the series lost when he left.",
