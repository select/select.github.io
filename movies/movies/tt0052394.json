      "description": "Alright - so we know it is too cold for a drive-in feature - at least here in the north east USA, but since when did something like the weather ever stop us! Besides, we thought we would try and warm things up a little with some more \"Wild Women\". Of course, after the usual coming attractions and a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we proudly bring you that 1958 classic from the sunny land of Florida - \"The Wild Women of Wongo\". Then, after a our brief intermission, we close out the evening with \"Island of Lost Women\", featuring a cast of few and Alan Napier - Alfred the Butler from the 1960's Batman TV show. Now, if this doesn't cause you to turn up the heat and visit the snack bar for a bit of hot-toddy, we figure you are dead and we look forward to seeing you in one of our future presentations! http://shockerredirect.tk/ or http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/",
