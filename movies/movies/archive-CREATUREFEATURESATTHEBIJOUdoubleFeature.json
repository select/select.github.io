      "description": "Return with us to those wonderful days of yesteryear when gigantic bugs and antimatter vultures from outer space bigger than battleships ruled the big screens of America. I get choked up just thinking about it. Nature run amok begins with previews of coming disasters and a cartoon. Then it’s 30-year-old teenagers and a monstrous arachnid in “Earth vs the Spider.” Next telepathic crabs would like to make cakes out of us in the Roger Corman classic “Attack of the Crab Monsters.” Where was Aquaman when we needed him? (Damn stuck-up superheros!)",
