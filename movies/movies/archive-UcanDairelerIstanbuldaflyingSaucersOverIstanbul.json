      "description": "Ucan Daireler Istanbulda (Flying Saucers Over Istanbul) is a Turkish sci-fi comedy from 1955. It's recommended for fans of old Turkish movies and psychotronic cult films. It has a quite different feel than the more familiar superhero films from the country like Kilink Istanbulda, etc. It more closely resembles something like Abbot and Costello On Mars, with the addition of belly dancing. There are leotard-clad female aliens, a Plan 9-style spaceship, a Marilyn Monroe imitator. and a robot made out of a cardboard box. The leader of the female aliens tries her hand at interpretive dance. The plot, or what I can discern of it, involves a club founded by older unattractive wealthy women. The club uses sexy belly dancing to lure men in, then the womenfolk attempt to have their way with them. There are files with and without subtitles. It was directed by Orhan Ersin, and stars Orhan Ersin, Zafer Onen, Halide Piskin, Semiramis Guze, Ozcan Tekgul and Mirella Monro. I especially like the credit sequence- the featured dancer is unbearably cute. Give this a try- it's odd and interesting.",
