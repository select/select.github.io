      "description": "The state comes into confrontation with director Andrei Khrjanovsky, who gives new vision to the masses and shows them a different horizon.  Glass Harmonica was shelved by Soviet censors who found it ideologically disturbing and was finally released after perestroika. It was the first animated film score by the late legendary Russian composer Alfred Schnittke, who was to collaborate with Khrjanovsky on more than half of his films.  The animators Yulo-llmar Sooster and Yuri Nolyev-Sobolev were among the most important artists of the Soviet underground.  Before finding refuge at Soyuzmultifilm, they participated in the famous and controversial Manege exhibit of underground art, which was eventually closed down by Khruschev and condemned by the Soviet press.",
