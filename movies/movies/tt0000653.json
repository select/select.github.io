      "description": "A Calamitous Elopement was directed by D.W. Griffith for the Biograph Company in 1908. One of the hundreds of films Griffith made for the company, it is a not particularly distinguished comedy about the comic complications a couple encounter when eloping. These pictures were often made in a week and were sometimes not well thought out. For example, why did she elope with an empty trunk?",
