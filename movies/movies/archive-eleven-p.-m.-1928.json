      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Afro-Cuban immigrant filmmaker Richard D. Maurice released this surrealist crime drama in 1928 to little acclaim or box office, though modern views highly praise this film as highly experimental with an innovative cinematography. This is the only surviving full-length film from Maurice unfortunately, but it has thankfully been well preserved.",
