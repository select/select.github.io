      "description": "Title: The Blue Parrot Summary: A London Soho nightclub is the focus for an undercover investigation into the murder of a small-time crook. Directed by: John Harlow Actors: Dermot Walsh, Jacqueline Hill, Ballard Berkeley Production Company: Association of Cinema Technicians (A.C.T.) Release Date: October 1953 (UK) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 A British film noir featuring John Le Mesurier giving a superbly understated performance in, for him, a non-typical role as a shady Soho nightclub owner. The film gives the viewer a real feel for the seamier side of Post War London and also features the new ideas and methods involved in crime fighting, including a visit from an American cop. Strong supporting roles from many British actors, mostly known for their comedic roles, including Ballard Berkeley (as Supt. Chester), later famous for his role as 'The Major' in Fawlty Towers. Well-written and directed and with some great twists in the plot, which play away from the typical 50's stereotypical characters of the more mainstream crime films of the period. A real gem!",
