They swipe it with the aid of the turtle and his elongated neck, but are pursued by a police officer. They try to paddle away across a pond and up a river, but the officer's determined to catch them. He tricks them into his paddy wagon and they end up in prison, where the hijinks continue with a daring jail break. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/alice-the-jail-bird-1925/",
