      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: Euro War or Macaroni Combat is a sub-genre of war movies produced and directed Europeans, usually Italian. They emerged in the late-1960s, at the time when Italy’s famed Cinecittà Studio was churning out “genre” films, movies made to cash in on and mimic the success of Hollywood blockbusters, in this case, THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967,) GUNS OF NAVARONE (1967,) and KELLY’S HEROES (1970). Another example of this genre available on PizzaFLIX is Umberto Lenzi’s Desert Commandos (1967).\n\nStars: Guy Madison, Peter Lee Lawrence, Erika Blanc \nDirector: Alfonso Brescia\n\nSet during World War II in the days just before the D-Day invasion, a special parachute unit is sent to destroy a German flame thrower installation on Omaha Beach.",
