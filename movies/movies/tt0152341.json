Scrappy and Oopie are tootling along in a car-and-trailer rig, and it's a most remarkable trailer, larger on the inside than the outside, , able to submerge and fly, and containing a cow, as well as a tree they can plant to picnic under. It contains a wasp nest and a bear. Maybe they stole it from Doctor Who.Maybe they are Doctor Who. It would explain so much about this often brilliant and often baffling series.Like many of them, it takes an abrupt turn in the middle, going from ridiculous and inventive to standard.",
