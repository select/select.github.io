      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. \"He has almost no money... Mother-in-law berates him and sneaks around with another man... and he is about as courageous as a turtle... Poor Daddy!\" This early Chinese comedy is about a man who seems to never catch a break, as well as his son who always fights for him. While the picture does rely on some misogynistic tropes for some of the humor, there are stunts, fights, and more than a few surprises in this film that definitely make it worth watching. I couldn't find a soundtrack for this picture, so I designed one using public domain Chinese recordings, as well as modern public domain songs that use classical Chinese instruments. I've also uploaded two versions of the film, one with slightly choppier video, but slightly better quality otherwise. The other with a much less choppy frame-rate. I decided to do the soundtrack for the less choppy version as I felt it was more watchable. ",
