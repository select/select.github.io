He also takes a shine to the Princess -- looking like Kitty in a blonde wig -- and she to him. But can Krazy and she get together when earlier applicants who failed to raise a smile get dragged off to the headsman?It's a fairly good entry in the series which had torn its moorings to the George Herriman comic strip a decade earlier. A redesign of the character had recently taken place, using the newer egg-based designs, and the animators were having fun stretching themselves.... and the characters.",
