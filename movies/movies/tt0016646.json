      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This cross-dressing romantic comedy follows Marion Davies as the cousin of the prince of the country of Graustark. Her cousin is about to be decreed as king, but he suffers an injury that keeps him in bedrest. The prince begs his cousin to take his place and she happily does so. Unfortunately, she now has two issues to contend with: keeping up the act of being a haughty prince, and falling in love with the prince's bodyguard. The film was a great financial and critical hit upon release and ended up being Davies' biggest success. ",
