      "description": "“One of the greatest British films” “Magnificent, compelling” “Wonderfully done and perfectly cast” “Bloody good movie” (IMDB reviews quotes) NOTE: Although less than perfect, this upgraded copy is crisper and with improved contrast. The green cast of the un-enhanced original has been removed. The superb screen adaptation of Shaw’s classic tale of Eliza Doolittle and her teacher-tormentor Henry Higgins. Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller lead an outstanding cast. One Oscar win for best screenplay. Re-adapted in1964 as “My Fair Lady.” Highly recommended. IMDB rating 7.8. Directed by Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard. Released in 1938 (UK). Complete print (original UK release). CAST NOTE: Wendy Hiller’s second film role.",
