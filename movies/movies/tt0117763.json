    "Plot": "A decent movie, with a moderately interesting story.  Certain parts feature some really good humour, others some cool gang fighting, but all in all, it just fell short due to the fact that you just don't care enough about the characters.  Not bad, good if you can pick it up for cheap, but don't pay import prices for it.",
