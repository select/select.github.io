      "description": "This is the same Trip To The Moon that you will find in three other places on the Archive, one of them mine. I realized after uploading that those versions went at the video speed of 30 frames per second. Those movies were originally projected at 18 frames per second. I went back to my editing program but the closest I could come to it was 20 fps. I thought I would have to replace the music, but slowing it down like that did something t it which is not unpleasant. enjoy. â ",
