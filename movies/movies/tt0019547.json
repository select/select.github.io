    "Plot": "This animated film begins with a child's toy disappearing--with a balloon carrying the doll away. However, it's tour of the world is bizarre, as the tour is NOT sequential--with the toy bouncing back and forth all over the world with little rhyme or reason. It goes from the changing of guard in Sweden, to some Moroccans, to a Bavarian park, a Japanese parade, Mexico, India (with Indian cartoons looking like overly stereotypical blacks), a Javan hot springs, Holland (the costumes were very nice), Greece (with an interesting melting effect) and Borneo where you see hippos--about 5000 miles from where they SHOULD be in Africa! Overall, this is a film where the story is a bit shabby but the animation and concept is quite good. Well worth seeing for fans of early animation.",
