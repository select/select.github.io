Simonson is murdered apparently by a burglar at the Chelsea Towers West where he lives, efficient Detective Thorn is assigned to investigate the case with his partner Solomon \"Sol\" Roth. Thorn comes to the fancy apartment and meets Simonson's bodyguard Tab Fielding and the \"furniture\" (woman that is rented together with the flat) Shirl and the detective concludes that the executive was not victim of burglary but executed.
