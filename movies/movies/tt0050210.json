      "description": "A powerful criminal brain from the planet Arous hijacks the body of an Earth scientist and threatens countries all over the world with destruction unless they acknowledge his rule. But another alien brain arrives to capture him, gaining the cooperation of the scientist's fiancee and her father. John Agar as Steve March Joyce Meadows as Sally Fallon Thomas Browne Henry as John Fallon Robert Fuller as Dan Murphy I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
