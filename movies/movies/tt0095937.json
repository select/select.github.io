      "description": "A backstage murder leads to a jury room drama in which Joe E Brown is the only holdout for acquittal. \"Twelve Angry Men\" it's not, but as a primative early talkie it is an interesting curiosity. The print is in reasonably good condition. Directed by Albert S Rogell (as Albert Rogell). Released in 1929. Approximately 3 minutes are missing. CAST NOTE: Joe E Brown began his show biz career at the age of ten as a circus tumbler and clown. In later years he would claim he was the only kid who had parents that told their son to run away and join the circus.",
