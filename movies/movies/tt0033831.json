    "Plot": "The Austrian goverment, always short of money, tries to sell the Austrian customs to a consortium of Swiss banks. Unfortunately on the Austrian-Swiss border there is the customs officer Laurenz Hasenhuettl, played by the unforgettable Hans Moser, who confuses the envoy of the Swiss banks with a wanted criminal. He creates such a chaos that finally the Austrian goverment collapses. This is one of the very few Hans Moser films, which besides excellent performance of Moser is also based on a good story.",
