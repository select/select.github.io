      "description": "Young shipping clerk turns out to have extraordinary golfing skills that impress his boss so much that he gets the clerk admitted to the local ritzy country club. There he falls in love with a young rich gal. Fun silent romantic comedy starring William Haines and Joan Crawford. Colorized with DeOldify technology. The original film deteriorated with age and shows blemishes in various parts, but these are still watchable. No soundtrack. (Note: Although this movie is public domain, the colorization is copyright by me. My colorized movies are freely uploaded for free personal use. Please don't put them on your own YouTube channel and monetize them. Thanks.)",
