Baker and Monty Berman and directed by Quentin Lawrence . The film stars Forrest Tucker , Laurence Payne , Janet Munro and Jennifer Jayne . The special effects are by Les Bowie . The story is based on a 1956 British ITV \"Saturday Serial\" television programme written by George F. Kerr , Jack Cross and Giles Cooper under the collective pseudonym of \"Peter Key\". The film was released as The Crawling Eye in the United States on 7 July 1958 by Distributors Corporation of America and as The Trollenberg Terror in the United Kingdom in October 1958 by Eros Films . It played on a double bill with the British science fiction film The Strange World of Planet X , retitled Cosmic Monsters for American audiences. The Trollenberg Terror ' s storyline concerns United Nations troubleshooter Alan Brooks, later joined by journalist Philip Truscott, investigating unusual accidents occurring in the area of a resort hotel on the fictional Mount Trollenberg in Switzerland. Brooks suspects that these deaths are related to a series of similar incidents which occurred three years earlier in the Andes Mountains , which involved an unexplained radioactive mist and an odd cloud formation believed by locals to be inhabited.",
