      "description": "Another week and we say \"Welcome back to 'Shocker Internet Drive In'\". Once again we invite you relive the great old days of warm summer nights (or cool fall evenings), stale popcorn, dry hamburgers, bad movies, fun cartoons and,everyone's favorite drive in activity, backseat love. Tonight we present are presenting a black & white double feature in \"Deadland\". After an early Porky Pig cartoon, we proudly present the George A. Romero classic \"Night of the LIving Dead\", sourced from a nice print by the way (parental discreation is advised). And if that wasn't enough, we close out our show with another \"dead\" cult classic - \"Carnival of Souls\"! (FYI - per request!) Of course, as always, our feature includes the usual movie previews, drive-in advertisements and fun. So sit back, put your speaker in the car window and enjoy.
