    "Plot": "Intent on stealing the ultimate instrument of destruction, the rapid-fire Gatling gun, the U.S. Cavalry deserter, Private Sneed, betrays his country for personal profit. To ensure that he can sneak out of the country with the machine gun, Sneed tricks the irenic preacher, Reverend Harper, into accompanying him; however, Lieutenant Wayne Malcolm and his small patrol unit manage to apprehend him, retrieving the gun. But, under those circumstances, the fearsome Apache warrior, Chief Two-Knife, is willing to offer mountains of gold, or even sacrifice some of his men, to get his hands on Richard J. Gatling's devastating invention, and no one can stop him and his hordes. Now, it's up to Lieutenant Malcolm, a scout named Runner, Jim Boland the rancher, and the ingenious man nicknamed Tin Pot to put an end to the dangerous ambition of the Apache leader. Can they protect the King Gun, the super-weapon to end all wars?",
