      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This once-lost film serial is one of the earliest sound serials that still exists. It has an attached soundtrack and some sound effects, but has no spoken dialogue. Tarzan the Tiger is actually a sequel to the Tarzan the mighty serial series, though that serial is unfortunately considered lost. While reviews are not exactly ecstatic for this serial, it still serves as a fun time capsule for the era.  Version Sourced from \"Cult Cinema Classics\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HdMyBN8vow , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACcmRT0lEW8",
