      "description": "Director Anthony Kilburn's daring, 60s-inspired journey through sex, drugs, and art in a unique take on the age-old question of whether or not to sell out or stay true. Struggling painter Calvin (Christopher Bolla) has always tried to do the right thing while not sacrificing his own desire to one day become a successful artist. Unable to adequately provide for or satisfy his seductive, longtime girlfriend, Nancy (Christianna L. White), he begrudgingly makes a series of artistic and ethical concessions that deliver fame and wealth, but threaten to corrupt his ideals. All the while, Calvin scrupulously perfects a painting of his spirited model and newfound muse, Marjorie (Milan Alley), in secret, risking both his relationship and success. His dilemma is ultimately Faustian; Will he choose everything he's ever wanted or everything he's ever needed? ***This motion picture has been rated 18+ by the filmmakers due to NUDITY, SIMULATED SEX, DRUG USE, PROFANITY, and BRIEF VIOLENCE.***",
