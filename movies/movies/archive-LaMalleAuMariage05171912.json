      "description": "Pathe comedy written and directed by Max Linder. Premiered in Vienna on May 17, 1912. Released in the UK on June 8, 1912 \" The guardian of Mamie, with whom Max is in love, wishes to make the girl his wife. Mamie, holding her guardian in mortal terror, insists upon Max concealing himself one day when the former obtrudes his presence upon them. Max obeys, and finding behind the hanging wardrobe a lady's long plush coat and hat, he dons both articles to make his escape. The disguise leads the guardian, who observes him depart, into supposing that a pretty woman is the owner of the coat. He follows \"her,\" and Max inveigles him into his own rooms, shams a scare on account of a supposed husband, and manages to get him locked up in a big trunk, from which he is released only on his giving his consent to Max's engagement to Mamie.\" (The Bioscope, May 30, 1912) Note: For this upload, German intertitles, which survive on a censorship card (No.:17812; Berlin, May 8, 1912) are the basis for the English translation.",
