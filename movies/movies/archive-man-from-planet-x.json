      "description": "A scientist (Raymond Bond), his daughter (Margaret Field), and an American reporter  (Robert Clarke) discover that a spaceship from a previously unknown rogue planet has landed in the foggy moors of a remote Scottish island, carrying a humanoid alien. But an unscrupulous colleague (William Schallert) tries to force it to reveal the formula for the incredibly strong but light metal of its ship, and the alien responds by imposing mind control on several of the local townsfolk, apparently preparing for an invasion of the Earth. Robert Clarke as John Lawrence Margaret Field as Enid Elliot Raymond Bond as Professor Elliot William Schallert as Dr. Mears Roy Engel as the Constable Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
