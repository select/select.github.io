Oppie begins to wreak havoc, but when the toys begin to attack the two of them, they defend themselves.It's one of the better Scrappy cartoons following ick Huemer's disappearance from the series, with some nice fantasy sequences and a paricularly apt score. Although some of the gags are a bit rote -- like when Oopie puts on a blonde wig and does a Mae West imitation -- there's a good deal of childlike imagination on display.",
