      "description": "Another simulated double feature program in a second-run movie house of the type which no longer exists: The lighthearted entertainment begins with coming attractions and a cartoon. Then in \"Half a Sinner\" a makeover and a naughty canary send a bored school marm (Heather Angel) and a handsome stranger (John King) off on a rolicking car chase with a corpse in the back seat. This leads to romance for her, him and the canary. The great Constance Collier is part of the fun. Next Diana Lynn and Guy Madison costarr in the quirky romance \"Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven.\" However it's the noted character actors of its large supporting cast who provide much if not most of the off-beat fun. Director William Castle's first A-feature production, and Audie Murphy's screen debut.",
