      "description": "Go back more than a century in time on a spectacular trip to see the England that Shakespeare used to know! Visit his favorite haunts like Leamington Spa, Kenilworth castle, Stratford upon Avon, Warwick & Warwick Castle, Anne Hathaways cottage and much more. Anne Hathaway was Shakespeare's wife whom he married in 1582. Shakespeare's most important works were written around the year 1600. We also see the house of Marie Corelli. She was a novellist who moved to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1899 and did a lot for this town.
