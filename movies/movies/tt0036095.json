      "description": "“So realistic it hurts” “Some nice moments” (IMDB reviews quotes). A wartime drama meant to recruit women for nursing that may have had the opposite effect by being too true to life. An adaption of the novel “One Pair of Feet” by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens. Good cast and production. IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Maurice Elvey. Released in 1943 (UK only). Complete print.",
