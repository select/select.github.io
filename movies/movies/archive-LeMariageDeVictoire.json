      "description": "\"How Bridget's Lover Escaped\" (\"Le marriage de Victoire\") is a comedy from Georges Méliès. It begins with a man (I think he's a fireman) in he kitchen--making out with the cook, Bridget. When folks overhear the commotion, they enter the kitchen and the man hides. After a while, I guess he got bored and attacks them. This leads to a police chase on the rooftops of Paris. In the end, Bridget and her lover marry. Director: Georges Méliès",
