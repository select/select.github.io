      "description": "DVD remux of the 1946 Monogram Pictures film \"The Trap.\" IMDb TMDB Wikipedia The Trap is a 1946 American mystery crime film directed by Howard Bretherton and starring Sidney Toler and Victor Sen Yung. The main premise is that two members of a show troupe are murdered, and detective Charlie Chan is called in to solve the case. This was Toler's 22nd and final appearance as Chan, and his final film of any kind. Suffering from cancer during his last few films, Toler was often so weak that he could hardly walk or say his lines coherently. (The film entered the public domain due to the omission of a valid copyright notice on original prints.)",
