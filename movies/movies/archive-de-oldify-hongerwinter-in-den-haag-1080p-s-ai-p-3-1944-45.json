      "description": "This Part-3 of my series about The Netherlands during WWII focusses on a very sad period towards the end of the war during which the Northern half of the country suffered a terrible famine. Most parts of The Netherlands south of the three main rivers (Rijn, Maas & Waal) had been liberated by the allied forces at the end of autumn 1944. However, the North remained under German occupation. Food became increasingly scarce caused by cut off supply lines and the Germans plundering the country to the bone. Hordes of Dutch citizens went to the country side to try to get some remaining food that some farmers still had in stock. Many trees were cut down and twigs were gathered to provide some heating and cooking fuel. Wooden blocks between the tram rails were gathered and used as well. People illegally tore wooden panels, doors and other objects from bombed houses. Many food stores were closed because of lack of stock and people desperately tried to trade their remaining posessions for any food they could get their hands on. Especially the children suffered. Overall between 20,000 and 25,000 people are estimated to have died as the direct result of the famine. Indirectly there was an over-mortality of 58,000 people. In my town of birth, The Hague (in Dutch Den Haag), approximately 2100 people died of starvation during the so called \"Honger winter\" of 1944/1945. People ate beatroot, tulips bulbs and sometimes even their cats and dogs. In the last months of the war about 200,000 inhabitants of The Hague got their food in the form of soup from the so called \"Gaarkeukens\" (public kitchens). Relief came in the days after the 8th of May 1945 when the whole country had been liberated. Allied planes dropped food packages in large numbers over The Hague and other large Dutch cities. For the first time in 5 years people and especially children could be properly fed, as can be seen in this rather emotional film.",
