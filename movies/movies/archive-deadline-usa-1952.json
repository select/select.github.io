      "description": "Learning that his newspaper is about to be sold, a crusading editor (Humphrey Bogart) at first views his impending unemployment as an opportunity to win back his estranged wife (Kim Hunter). But when one of his reporters (Warren Stevens) is badly beaten, he goes on a crusade against the ganster who did it (Martin Gabel), hoping to prove him guilty of a woman's murder in the three issues that he has left. Humphrey Bogart as Ed Hutcheson Ethel Barrymore as Margaret Garrison Kim Hunter as Nora Hutcheson Ed Begley as Frank Allen Warren Stevens as George Burrows Paul Stewart as Harry Thompson Martin Gabel as Tomas Rienzi Joe De Santis as Herman Schmidt Jim Backus as Jim Cleary I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
