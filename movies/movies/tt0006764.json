    "Plot": "Roscoe Arbuckle and Mabel Normand are cast as a happy couple living in a richly furnished mansion. Roscoe is a physician. Things begin to happen when Mabel's old school friend, William Jefferson, comes to see her. Their innocent pleasure in talking over old times is misunderstood by Roscoe, and he is fuming with rage and jealousy, but Mabel pays no attention to him. Complications occur aplenty owing to the machinations of crooks. They send a hurry-up call for Roscoe, saying that a patient is dying in a nearby town. When Roscoe finds that the address given is that of a vacant house, he races back in his big auto. But things are happening rapidly meanwhile at the mansion. Mabel goes to bed and discovers Al St. John, a burglar, under her bed. Her cries bring Jefferson on the scene. The burglar makes a sudden getaway through a window. When Roscoe returns, he finds Jefferson trying to restore Mabel who has fainted away. Roscoe is furious and knocks Jefferson down several times. He then turns on Mabel and chokes her. He leaves her unconscious, but she suddenly comes to. With a gun in her hand and with fury in her eye, she pursues him to the stairs. He falls and slides halfway down the stairs, turns a complete flip-flop, and comes to rest with a thud at the bottom. Mabel takes pity on him, and they forget their animosities and settle down to happiness again.",
