    "Plot": "Krazy Kat steers his magic carpet to three exotic locations while declaiming in the style of a radio announcer. The locales are the North Pole, where penguins luge down the mountains to the sea atop (presumably leopard) seals, Holland, where dachshunds wear wooden shoes, and somewhere in Equatorial Africa, where he watches vartoon Ubangis invent rhythm.Yes, it's about that bad. The variety of vices in the Krazy Kat cartoons in this period show that franchise runners Manny Gould and Ben Harrison were running out of ideas. It was a frequent cycle for long-running cartoon series, in which Mickey would be upstaged by Goofy and Donald, or Oswald the Lucky Rabbit would show up only to introduce whatever critter was actually going to be funny. This one doesn't even show signs of trying very hard, sticking to lazy stereotypes for its jokes.",
