When he and his employees have gone back into the store for a moment, a trash collector mistakenly picks up the crate and carries it off. A frantic chase results in most of the hats being scattered throughout the neighborhood. Later, Mr. Cohen, upset about the loss, looks for a way to make some of his money back.",
