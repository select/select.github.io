      "description": "A simulated double feature program at a second-run movie house. The dastardly deeds and desperate situations begin with coming attractions and a cartoon. Then Edmond O'Brien solves his own murder in the 4-star thriller, \"D.O.A.,\" followed by a short subject, \"Souvenirs of Death.\" Then in the critically acclaimed \"Detour\" Ann Savage is the psychotic pickup from hell who leads herself and Tom Neal to disaster. NOTE: The upgraded \"D.O.A.\" print in this simulation has also been uploaded as a separate item under the title \"\"D.O.A.video quality upgrade\"",
