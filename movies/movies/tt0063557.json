      "description": "A rugged trapper, forced to trade his valuable furs for a well-behaved, escaped slave, vows to retrieve the furs from the Indians and later from the renegades who killed them..  An elegantly staged Western that reflects the political climate of the 1960s: after initially promoting violence as a legitimate means of combating oppression, the conciliatory ending weakens this thrust.",
