      "description": "*SUBSCRIBE to MOVIE CENTRAL!* - https://bit.ly/3mRDJox \nOctober 1992. Londoner Jane Darcy travels to Greenvale, New York to claim the remains of her mother, Emma Grey, who died from a brain aneurism. She encounters Christopher Dodd, a twisted man with a deep connection to her late mother and Sheriff Miranda Lacey, his fierce protector. An evil secret wrought by Jane’s grandmother Mary's guilt from an illicit affair with a local priest decades earlier has savage repercussions. It is only when Jane sees Christopher ceremoniously burning Emma's things in a raging fire he set in a rusted-out silo, that the full extent of the evil comes to light.\n**This film is under non-exclusive license from Distribution Solutions/Alliance Entertainment.
