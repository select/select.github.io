      "description": "The 2am Theater presents a bone-chilling and funny-bone-tickling simulated double feature program at a second-run theater in the ‘60s. The chills and chuckles begin with coming attractions. Then we’re off to sunny Italy where in “Curse of the Faceless Man” a two-thousand-year-old gladiator comes back to life because he has the hots for a certain reincarnated cutie. (Hey, it could happen!) Next we’re off to sunny Mexico to meet evil Baron Vitelius and his monstrous killer tongue in “The Brainiac,” which is so astoundingly bad it’s fall-down-laughing hilarious. NOTE: “Curse of the Faceless Man” is now available as a separate item here:  https://archive.org/details/curseofthefacelessman    ",
