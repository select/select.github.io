Victory presses Pete to fight for the position of the mine superintendent, which he earns. Unable to bear her poor surroundings and unsatisfied with being a miner's wife, Victory decides to climb the social ladder and have an affair with the wealthy owner of the mine, Gary Linden (Conway), unbeknownst to her faithful husband. Suddenly, a ferocious tornado forms and hits the town and the mine, putting everyone's life in danger. For its time, the film has impressive visual effects for the tornado sequence.",
