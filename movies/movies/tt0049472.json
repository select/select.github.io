    "Plot": "Mexican gunfighter Dave Robles outdraws gunfighter Dan Ritchy and later kills two outlaws while dispatching a third. As a result, Robles is asked to assume the office of sheriff after the previous lawman quits the job. But a tin star doesn't bring automatic respectability and Robles is shunned by the town's leading citizens. His popularity with its less-savory element, particularly saloon owner Bannister, wanes dramatically, too, as he starts to take his job seriously. It is his love for a decent, caring woman that keeps Dave in town, but can she convince him to lay down his gun and start a new life?",
