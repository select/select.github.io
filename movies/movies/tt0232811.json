    "Plot": "Tillie and her girl chum see their old gardener burning brush in the garden and they jump on their bicycles and ride to the fire-engine house and give the alarm. When the hose-cart is left before the house the girls climb to the driver's seat and make off with the apparatus. Their experience is a wild one and they have a high old time, running into several things and nearly over many folk. At last when closely pursued they uncouple the hose, hitch it to a hydrant and play the water on the unfortunates.",
