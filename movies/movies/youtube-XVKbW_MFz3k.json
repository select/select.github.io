      "description": "Ex-con trucker shifts gears from suspect to sleuth!\nA truck driver stops on a rainy road at night to help a stranded motorist, but it turns out to be a ruse--he is attacked, knocked out and his truck stolen. Since he has a criminal record, the police immediately suspect he's involved in the hijacking, and their suspicions are reinforced later when he is discovered--unknown to him--to be hauling stolen merchandise. He realizes he is being set up as a fall guy by the organization behind the truck hijackings, and he and a friend set out to determine who is trying to set him up, and why.\n\nColorized version: https://youtu.be/vFP9T_ksoAQ\n\nAlternative title: Gangster from Chicago (1950)\n\nDirector: Sam Newfield\nWriters: Orville H.
