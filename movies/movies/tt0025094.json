      "description": "Jessie Matthews reprises her celebrated role as Harriet Green in this rendition of the Rodgers and Hart musical. Three songs by the American composer Harry Woods are thrown in for good measure.

Matthews had a dual role as both mother and daughter. The film was produced by Michael Balcon and directed by Victor Saville.

    "Plot": "Harriet Green, a beloved and radiant music hall star of the Edwardian era, has a guilty secret: She has a baby daughter, born out of wedlock. Harriet leaves her public and flees to South Africa to raise her daughter quietly. The years pass, and now her daughter, Harriet Hawkes, returns to London as a young show-biz hopeful. Tommy, a wily publicity man, knowing that young Harriet is a dead ringer for her famous mother, convinces a theater producer to star her in a new revue as none other than the original Harriet Green, miraculously untouched by old age. The ruse works too well: Now the public believes Harriet is a well-preserved 60-year-old and Tommy is her son. The deception is more than merely inconvenient, because now Harriet and Tommy have secretly fallen in love.",
