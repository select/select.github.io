      "description": "Murder à la Mod is a 1968 experimental, low-budget murder-mystery directed by Brian De Palma in his first feature film as a director and writer. Starring Andra Akers, William Finley, Margo Norton and Jared Martin. Plot: Karen (Margo Norton) discovers her lover Chris (Jared Martin), who she believed to be a widower, is in fact not only married but a director of sexploitation films and complicit in a peeping tom scam. He is only doing this, he says, to finance a divorce. She is so in love that, apparently in keeping with the times, she accepts being slapped around. And so in love that, to prevent him wasting his talent by demeaning himself on such shoddy goods, she steals cash from socialite pal Tracy (Ann Ankers) to fund the divorce. After a fake attack by nutcase Otto (William Finley) with a prop ice-pick, Karen is done to death by a real assailant with a real ice-pick. So then the tale shifts as we follow the perspective of different characters in different time periods, each time uncovering a bit more of the truth or perhaps the fiction.",
