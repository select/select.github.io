      "description": "“Surprisingly candid propaganda” “A war film of rare authenticity” “The film Winston Churchill wanted to ban” “Spying, training, combat action -- this film has them all” (IMDB reviews quotes). A compelling government-produced action-docudrama which effectively shows how careless words at home can lead to combat losses overseas. Excellent cast and production. National Board of Review Top Ten Films List for 1943. IMDB rating 6.9. Directed by Thorold Dickinson. UK release 1942. US release 1943. Complete print (PAL transfer) NOTE: Fortunately for the British and us World War II German espionage usually proved to be much less competent and effective than depicted in this film.",
