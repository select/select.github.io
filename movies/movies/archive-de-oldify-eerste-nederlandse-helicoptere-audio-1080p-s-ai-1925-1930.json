      "description": "Remarkable footage of very early attemps to construct a Helicopter in The Netherlands. This Helicopter was designed by A.G. von Baumhauer. He engaged on this development adventure as a direct result of the issue in 1922 of a competition by the British Air Ministry to award a prize to the first person or organisation who would develop a helicopter that could reach a height of 100 meters and fly at a speed of 100kmh. This film shows in great detail how the first prototype was constructed. Its first flight took place on the 30th of October 1925 which sadly ended in catastrophe when the helicopter toppled-over and was totally destroyed. Almost two months later, on the 24th of December a second attempt was made. This flight was more successful and the helicopter shortly hovered about half a meter from the ground. Viewed through todays eyes these attempts make a somewhat ludacrous impression, hence the chosen music. However, these first attempts were deadly serious, especially considering the Dutch desire to follow in the footsteps of the great Russian-American helicopter developer Igor Sikorsky who already made his first helicopter design in 1909. Sikorsky's second design, with his model \"S2\", already flew at a height of between 60 to 80 feet as early as in 1910. Nevertheless it took about 30 more years for the helicopter-era to really \"take-off\". Various films on Youtube show Sikorsky himself piloting his VS300 model in 1941. In the in between years important lessons needed to be learned especially regarding the need to apply gyroscopes and a tail rotor for flight stability. It is unclear what happened to the Dutch attempts to build helicopters. It seems that not much effort was made to continue these developments after 1930. What is know for fact is that Von Baumhauer ceased his attempts simply because he ran out of money. The original film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of modern video software. Source B&W footage: Beeld En Geluid.",
