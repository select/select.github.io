      "description": "This final film by silent screen star Harold Lloyd comes nine years after his previous feature. In this film, that reprises a character portrayed by Lloyd in a 1925 film, it is shown what happened to our hero, Harold Diddlebock (Lloyd), twenty years after his big triumph on the college football field. Struggling in the same job he received twenty years previous, Diddlebock is fired so he wanders the streets and eventually goes into a bar. After drinking his first drink in his life, and a specially prepared drink in his honor, Diddlebock goes on a crazy rampage through town, buying things including a new wardrobe, a horse-drawn cab with cabby and also a circus. This Movie is one of my all-time personal favorites! enjoy",
