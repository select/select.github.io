    "Plot": "Fuzzy Knight is there when the curtain rises, singing nonsense scat songs into the piano lid, and generally mugging it up.If you know Knight at all, it is almost certainly from on of the more than 180 movies, almost all of them B westerns, in which he played the comic sidekick. Here he is doing his stage act, a silly thing in which he plays quite well, sings jazz quite well, and....i'd like to tell you how good Knight was, but despite his evident competence at this sort of comedy, it's just not my cup of tea. Still, for the kind of over-the-top humor it is, it looks well done.",
