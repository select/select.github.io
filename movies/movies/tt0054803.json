      "description": "The story takes place in the 1960s. Young nuclear scientists, obsessive experimenter Gusev, and skeptical theoretical physicist Kulikov are longtime friends who are in love with a girl named Lelya. As a result of scientific experiments, Gusev receives a life-threatening dose of radiation. Doctors' warnings about the danger threatening his life do not stop the scientist in search of scientific truth, perhaps the last for him.\n\nIMDb rating: 7.5\n\nYear of production: 1961\n\nDirector: Romm Mikhail\nWriters: Daniil Khrabrovitsky, Mikhail Romm\nComposer: John Ter-Tatevosyan\nCinematographer: German Lavrov\nProduction Designer: Georgy Kolganov\n\nCast: Smoktunovsky Innokenty, Evstigneev Evgeny, Ovchinnikova Luciena, Batalov Alexei, Voitsik Ada, Lavrova Tatyana, Teterin Evgeny, Plotnikov Nikolai, Grabbe Nikolay, Blinnikov Sergey, Sergeev Nikolai, Kozakov Mikhail, Belyaeva Valentina, Batyreva Natalya",
