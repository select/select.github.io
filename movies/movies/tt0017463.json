      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Director John Ford's final silent western, 3 Bad Men doesn't seem to have made much of an impact upon release, critically or financially. Modern viewers however have a lot to praise about the film, especially in regards to the acting and cinematography. The picture follows three outlaws as they attempt to protect a woman from other criminals during the gold rush in South Dakota. ",
