      "description": "A somewhat primitive proto-wuxia B&W silent short movie from 1933, with Chinese intertitles. A man and wife are bullied by their neighbors, but then get even through the use of a lot of fighting. The movie was directed, acted, and produced by Ren Pengnian, with his wife Wu Lizhu also acting. The pair went on to create well-regard Kung-Fu movies in Hong Kong after WWII.",
