    "Plot": "A newsreel parody. Among the scenes: The champagne spilled christening liberty ships makes the fish drunk; a professor shows us how simple self-defense with judo is by drawing a very complicated diagram; a riveter leaving work in shaky condition; the agricultural college huddles at their football game to plan a victory garden; a skier in Sun Valley skis into a pack of wolves (perusing a centerfold) ; an elaborate set of machinery for cheating at cards works mainly because the victim keeps getting bonked on the head.",
