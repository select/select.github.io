      "description": "A woman gets arrested after acting as a decoy in a bank robbery, even though a former childhood sweetheart believes her innocent. But before going to jail, she manages to steal the bank money from her accomplices, leaving it with her landlady to collect when she gets out. But complications ensue. Faye Emerson as Dot Burton Julie Bishop as Myrtle Reed Frank Wilcox as Kenneth Phillips Roland Drew as Carey Wells Jackie Gleason as Wilson Ruth Ford as Lucy Fenton Virginia Brissac as Mrs. Stoner Dorothy Vaughan as Jenkins Dorothy Adams as Deaf Annie William Hopper as John Vera Lewis as Ma Silsby I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
