    "Plot": "There's not much comedy - nor love - in this Comedy of Love. This film must have seemed a bit outdated even back in 1942. It simply isn't interesting enough material to really catch the viewer's attention. There are no interesting actors either. Magda Schneider, who ten years earlier was amazingly graceful in Liebelei, has turned into a stout Hausfrau and is much too old and stocky for the part of an aspiring young painter, mistaken for a lover of a popular composer. Her acting manners are rather tiresome as well. Operetta star Lizzi Waldmüller looks very elegant but hasn't much to do, aside from a rather forced big production number at the very end of the film. To put it short - a programmer. There are much better entries in the recently re-released series of war time German classics.",
