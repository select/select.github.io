      "description": "The 2am Theater presents a special Gothic horror double feature staring Barbara Steele, the stunning British beauty whose real voice was seldom heard on screen because most of her films were dubbed. The night of witchcraft and hauntings begins the with usual horrific previews. Then in “The Mask of Satan” (AKA “Black Sunday”) Barbara is an evil witch who returns from the grave to possess the body of her innocent descendant. Next in the uncut version of “Nightmare Castle” gorgeous Babs again returns from the grave, but this time it’s to wreak vengeance on the evil doctor who tortured and killed her and her lover. Now turn out the lights!",
