    "Plot": "Willy the Mouse refuses to drink his milk. His parents send him to bed, where he dreams he is a desperado in the Old West in this amusing Terrytoon.This Connie Rasinski cartoon uses a lot of tropes pulled from the Terry Studio's bag of tricks, including the mechanical horse that Willy rides in his dream. That horse dates from Terry's term as producer of Van Beuren's Aesop's Fables cartoons in the 1920s. It's all put together competently, as Terrytoons invariably were, but its protagonist with his squeaky child's voice and the child-like gags are all of a piece. Terry's audience was small children and this is aimed at them. You may enjoy it. For me, it's just another in a long series of mediocre cartoons assembled from a standard bag of tricks for characters that don't interest me.",
