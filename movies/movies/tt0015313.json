    "Plot": "Robert Andrews hosts a large party and there stages his own murder, to keep bank examiner Alfred Austin from examining the records of his bank. Everyone is suspected--especially young Hammond, who is in love with Andrews' ward, Anne Maynard, and Lester Knowles, who has been suspicious of Andrews' friendship with Mrs. Knowles. The hilarious turmoil that ensues is finally cleared up by the reappearance of Andrews himself and the announcement that Joshua Brown has repaid the large loan that the directors wished to conceal from Austin. Finally, the group learns that Austin has turned to real estate, and Andrews proclaims his love for Anne.",
