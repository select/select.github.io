Simon suspects that one of his partners, Paul Ravitch (Albert Lieven), is the man who set him up. Simon and Anna are desperate to get Simon a new trial. But no one believes him to be innocent, since he confessed to the murder. Simon's only chance is to escape from the prison hospital and track down his three former accomplices in order to obtain their truthful testimony regarding Simon's innocence.
