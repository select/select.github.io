The Fairy Godmother invisibly helps Cinderella, helping her when she goes to gather wood, and enabling her to meet Prince Charming as he travels through the forest. Soon afterward, the king plans a great ball so that the prince can meet all the women and choose one for his bride. Cinderella must help her family prepare for the ball, while she stays at home. But the Fairy Godmother appears again, and miraculously enables Cinderella to go after all, with dramatic consequences.",
