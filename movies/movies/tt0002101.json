      "description": "Cleopatra is a silent film created in 1912 by Helen Gardner and the Helen Gardner Picture Players. The film, in which Gardner stars in the title role, was based on a play written by Victorien Sardou. In a series of elaborately staged tableaux, it depicts Cleopatra (Gardner) and her love affairs, first with handsome fisherman-slave Pharon, then with Marc Antony. The film features lavish sets and costumes and at just over an hour, it was considered fairly lengthy.",

    "Plot": "When she discovers that a slave named Pharon professes his love for her, Cleopatra makes a bargain with him: she will give him ten days of \"love,\" at the end of which he is to commit suicide. He agrees, although the queen's handmaiden Iras, in love with the slave, isn't happy with the arrangement. Later when Cleopatra is seducing Marc Antony, her relationship with Pharon is used against her, but with little effect. She allies herself with Antony against Octavius, participates in a brief war, then meets her end rather than be subjected to Roman rule.",
