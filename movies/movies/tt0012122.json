    "Plot": "Gypsy Fair, a music hall dancer, is admired by Spike McFadden, a swaggering bully with a golden voice, and his brother, Billy, a timid and frail composer and poet. She is also coveted by Swan Way, a Chinaman who seeks vengeance when Gypsy not only rejects him but reveals his secret gambling den. One of Swan Way's followers attempts to rob Billy, and when the boy kills him, Spike assumes guilt for the crime and Swan Way makes it appear that Gypsy has betrayed him to the police. At the inquest, Billy saves Spike by a last-minute confession and is acquitted on a verdict of self-defense. Billy achieves fame as a composer, while Spike and Gypsy sign a contract with an important theatrical production.",
