      "description": "Both an American agent (George Brent) posing as a lawyer with the United States Embassy in London, and a Scotland Yard detective (Basil Rathbone) posing as a music critic, try to get close to a famous singer (Ilona Massey) whom they suspect of espionage. George Brent ... Tim Hanley Ilona Massey ... Carla Nillson Basil Rathbone ... Reggie Oliver Gene Lockhart ... Sidney Grenner George Zucco ... Webster Francis Pierlot ... Dr. Rowan Martin Kosleck ... Bruner Charles D. Brown ... Tetlow Marjorie Gateson ... Bertha Grenner Leyland Hodgson ... Sergeant Moulton Clayton Moore ... Sewell I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
