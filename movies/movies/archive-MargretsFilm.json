Late in the evening a phone call reached me, she had made herself ​​naked, I should come, take a picture of her, \"a photo for the Arts\". Irritated I drove to the hospice, but without a camera. When I saw her before me, I understood how serious she was. The next day, her wish was fulfilled as if it would have been mine, with this both our lives fulfilled miraculously.",
