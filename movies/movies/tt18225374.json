      "description": "Lost Lake Confessions | Drama Romance Movie | Full Free Movie 2024\n\nAfter a brief, tumultuous stint as a Hollywood director, JD returns to his hometown, where he receives news that could change his life forever. Longing for a break from this mid 30's reality, he gathers his three closest friends - Hill, Connie, and Ray - for an off-grid escape to Lost Lake, to relive the good times they had before life got in the way. What begins as a carefree weekend of drinking, music, and psychedelics soon takes an unexpected turn. When JD shares his secret, a ripple effect of confessions follows, unearthing the silent battles each of them has been fighting alone. Long-buried truths collide with laughter and heartbreak, forcing the group to confront the past, the future, and the unshakable bond that connects them. Through the haze of their wild reunion, they rediscover that hope, love and friendship are the strongest forces in their lives and that none of them are ever truly lost.\n\n2024.  Stars: Khamisa Wilsher, Gigi Saul Guerrero, Jerome Velinsky\n*Licensed from Indie Rights.
