      "description": "The Killers is a 1946 American  film noir  directed by  Robert Siodmak  and starring  Burt Lancaster  in his film debut, along with  Ava Gardner ,  Edmond O'Brien  and  Sam Levene . Based in part on the 1927  short story of the same name  by  Ernest Hemingway , it focuses on an insurance detective's investigation into the execution by two professional killers of a former boxer who was unresistant to his own murder. The screenplay was written by  Anthony Veiller , with uncredited contributions by  John Huston  and  Richard Brooks . Released in August 1946, The Killers was a critical and commercial success, earning four  Academy Award  nominations, including for  Best Director  and  Best Adapted Screenplay . Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his thematic intentions, was an open admirer of the film. It is widely regarded as one of the classics of the film noir genre. In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"",
