    "Plot": "A bully kicks Scrappy and his friends out of the barn that they have been using as a club house. They try to take it back in this increasingly bizarre and well made Dick Huemer cartoon.Huemer and his team quote extensively from other sources, including Victor Herbert's MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS and Lewis Milestone's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. This was fairly typical of the series. Unlike some of the series -- particularly the ones made after Huemer had left -- there's a full cartoon's worth of gags, so that the pace never lets down; Huemer even finds an amusing closing gag that is new to me.",
