Directed by: Douglas Peirce Actors: David Tomlinson, Andrew Crawford, Peggy Evans Production Company: Highbury Productions Release Date: 17 January 1949 (UK) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 Set in England, post-World War II; three young women attempt to balance their waitress jobs and their respective love-lives whilst their employer's restaurant - and all the waitresses - is investigated for potential black-market food trading. This lighthearted, romantic comedy is refreshingly heart-warming despite its subject matter. This is helped by tongue-in-cheek performances from the main actresses and a snappy script.",
