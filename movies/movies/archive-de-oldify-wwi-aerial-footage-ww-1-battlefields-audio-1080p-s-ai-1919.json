      "description": "This film shows unique and spectacular aerial views of the destruction of a town in the North of France after WWI as well its surrounding battlefields.  Extremely clear images of the trenches and the surroundings come into view as the cameraman on board of an early type of Zeppelin circles the battlefield. The name of the destroyed town is unknown. It is located near a wide river or close to sea. Special modern Artificial Intelligence video software was used to motion-stabilize, speed-correct, enhance and colorize this footage. Music: Trevor Kowalski - \"Remarkable convictions\" Source B&W film: Prelinger Archive.",
