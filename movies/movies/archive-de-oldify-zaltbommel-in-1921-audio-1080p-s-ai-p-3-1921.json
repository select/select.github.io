      "description": "Zaltbommel is a town in te province of Gelderland in The Netherlands. It lies in the 'Bommelerwaard', a fertile (river clay) agricultural area between the rivers Maas and Waal. The town is over 1000 years old. The first mentioning in scriptures of a town called Bomala was around the year 850. In 1350 it obtained city rights. This film shows the Sint Maartenskerk church, the local market, many great buildings, a nice panoramic view over the town with the nearby rivers, the bridge over the river Waal, busy shipping traffic on the river, the dykes along the river, the beautiful old water tower (still in existence!), and many picturesq spots in the old town, now exactly a century ago! Please help to complete the timeline below! The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced, restored and colorized by means of modern Artificial Intelligence video software.
