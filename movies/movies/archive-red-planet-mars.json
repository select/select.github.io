      "description": "An American scientist (Peter Graves) believes that he has made contact with people on Mars, who inform him that Mars is a utopia and that Earth's people can be saved too, if they return to the worship of God. Revolution sweeps the Earth, including the Soviet Union. But there remains doubt about the messages being genuine, as an ex-Nazi comes forward and claims that he has simply been pretending to be comminicating from Mars. Peter Graves as Chris Cronyn Andrea King as Linda Cronyn Herbert Berghof as Franz Calder Walter Sande as Admiral Bill Carey Marvin Miller as Arjenian Willis Bouchey as The President Morris Ankrum as Secretary of Defense Sparks Orley Lindgren as Stewart Cronyn Bayard Veiller as Roger Cronyn I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
