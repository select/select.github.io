      "description": "Gory revenge is raised to the level of visual poetry in Toshiya Fujita’s stunning  Lady Snowblood.  A major inspiration for Quentin Tarantino’s  Kill Bill  saga, this endlessly inventive film, set in late nineteenth-century Japan, charts the single-minded path of vengeance taken by a young woman (Meiko Kaji) whose parents were the unfortunate victims of a gang of brutal criminals. Fujita creates a wildly entertaining action film of remarkable craft, an effortless balancing act between beauty and violence.",
