      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. From Louis Feuillade, writer and director of other iconic film serials such as Fantomas and Les Vampires, this serial follows an explorer as he returns from Indochina with his new companion, Tih Minh. Unique for the time, Tih Minh is actually played by a biracial woman, Mary Harald, and her performance was especially heralded at the time of release. While the serial felt a little slow to overseas audiences, it was a commercial and critical hit in France. ",
