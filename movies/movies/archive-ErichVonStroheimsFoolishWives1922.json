      "description": "FILM IN 2 PARTS!!!! The 130 minutes version left of a film supposedly 6 hours long in its primary form. The most expensive production of that time, they say. (Director Stroheim, $700,000 producer Carl Laemmle, $1,300,000). Monte Carlo was entirely recreated on Hollywood backlot. Impressive indeed! more info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013140/",
