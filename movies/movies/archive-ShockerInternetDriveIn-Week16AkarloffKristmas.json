This double feature includes two of Boris' later works - the mexican miricle of weird movie making, \"Snake People\" as well as the 1963 Roger Corman classic of 3 day film fun, \"The Terror\". As always, we have included some wonderful trailers for some of the Master's other 1960's scares along with some of the usual advertisements guaranteed to bring you into our snack bar so that you can part with some of your hard earned cash!
