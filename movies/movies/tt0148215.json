He saves a baby from a burning building and is acclaimed a hero and is appearing on a television show. His fellow ghosts see the program and are afraid he will ruin the ghost business, and fly to the television studio. However, Casper tells the audience that the ghosts are there to entertain them, and the people laugh. The mayor gives Casper a skeleton-key to the city.",
