      "description": "A gangster revives the careers of a faded Gilbert and Sullivan troupe in an elaborate scheme to get back at the girl who rejected him. The plot is farfetched, to say the least, but in my opinion, Robert Armstrong turns in a better performance in this obscure B musical than in King Kong. And the musical numbers, taken from a variety of G and S operettas, are great and performed authentically. Robert Armstrong .... Jimmie Allen Irene Hervey .... Pearl Paula Stone .... Mabel Edward Brophy .... Pie Vivian Hart .... Beatrice William Danforth .... Howard Hathaway Holmes Herbert .... Charles Dillon Gwili Andre .... Flo Caritz Crawford .... Yum Yum Max Davidson .... Max Arthur Kay .... Adolph Wilbur Mack Frank Moulan .... Mark/Koko Horace Murphy .... Joe Bert Roach .... Sugar Plum Allen Rogers .... John Mildred Rogers .... Peggy Vera Ross .... Beatrice Hathaway Josef Swickard .... Jonesy Richard Tucker .... Charles Dillon Harry Tyler .... Chuck",
