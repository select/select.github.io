      "description": "Two men, a cynically disillusioned U.S. Marshal and an idealistic Army lieutenant, embark on a search for white people who have fallen into the hands of the Comanches. At the end of their bloody journey, they discover that not all of the prisoners are ready to return to civilization.. John Ford's Western often seems like a less consistent, less committed, and less meticulously crafted variation on \" The Searchers \" ( 1956 ). Remarkable compared to the average of the genre, but unconvincing given its director's stature.",
