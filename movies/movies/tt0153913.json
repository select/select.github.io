    "Plot": "Actually quite liked Terrytoons' 1948 output. While Mighty Mouse's efforts were a bit mixed and suffered from too much recycling of old hat premises, the Heckle and Jeckle cartoons for this year (same with 1947) were consistently good, the best very good and up to this point of the studio's overall output there hadn't been a single bad cartoon in that series. Which is amazing considering that the duo had only started featuring in cartoons two years before.Which is why it is sad that this cartoon, the third and last of the 1948 batch's non-regular character cartoons, was a misfire. The premise was not the most appealing or interesting of ones, but having seen a number of things that have made their premises a lot more interesting than they had right to be there was a glimmer of hope. For me, this is easily the weakest cartoon of Terrytoons' 1948 batch and the only one to actually do very little for me. Not terrible, but pretty lacklustre.There are a few good things. Music is fantastic and as ever with Terrytoons the best thing about this cartoon. It is beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is terrific fun to listen to and the lively energy is present throughout, doing so well with adding to the action. Close behind was the animation, as said more than once this component has come on considerably since the Terrytoons Studio first started. Overall, it is nicely detailed, lively and colourful, with nice attention to detail and vibrant colours that don't look garish.Some Terrytoons cartoon started off not so promisingly but got a lot better as it progressed. It was the opposite here. Actually thought that the first portion was quite promising. There is one amusing gag, one with the blimp.In a cartoon that is otherwise quite low on the gag count and what gags there are feel quite stale and one struggles raising even a smile. Despite starting off promisingly, it very quickly runs out of ideas and becomes very tedious and pretty much non-existent when it comes to the plot. And the cartoon was already very slight narratively, but the last third really is quite aimless all round and that there is too little content is very obvious in the too stretched out pace.Moreover, what little there is of the action borders on stupid, has no excitement or tension and is predictable. None of the characters, including the lead, are interesting or have personalities that appeal. All of them actually are pretty bland.Despite initial potential, this was a dull, lacklustre effort and the weak link of Terrytoons' 1948 batch. 4/10.",
