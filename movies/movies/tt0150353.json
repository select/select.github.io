    "Plot": "Puddy Pup is starring in a dog show -- a variety show in the Terrytoon universe -- when the affair is broken up by a dog catcher.Puddy was the white dog with a black ear that had been appearing in Terrytoons for a year. This is the first time I have seen him credited. Given that the credit is offered in a title card from a television print about a quarter century after this cartoon was first issued, it's impossible to say whether the name was current at the time. If so, he joined the long list of cartoon characters with alliterative names, like Mickey Mouse, Porky Pig and Barney Bear early in the compilation.The unnamed animator who had been enlivening Terrytoons for a couple of months offers some more fun. The dog catcher is simply designed and fluidly and amusingly animated. Otherwise it's more animals doing human things like acrobatics, singing sentimental ballads and pitching food in disapproval at the performers.",
