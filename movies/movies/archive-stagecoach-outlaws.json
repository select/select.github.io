      "description": "Billy Carson (Buster Crabbe) saves a woman (Frances Gladwin) from being kidnapped by a gang run by Steve Kirby (I. Stanford Jolley), who is trying to sabotage the stagecoach line of her father (Ed Cassidy).. Kirby sends his henchmen to recruit killer Matt Brawley, but they mistakenly return with Billy's old pal Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John). Fuzzy plays along with the masquerade to expose the gang, but then the real Brawley (Bob Kortman) shows up. Directed by Sam Newfield I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
