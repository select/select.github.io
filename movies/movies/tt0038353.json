    "Plot": "Ware College is a small Black college in Ware, Ohio. Once prominent, it is now low in attendance, low in enrollment and low on money; and at a meeting with instructors Drury and Annabelle Brown, Dean Hargreaves reveals that CEO Benjamin Ware III, grandson of the college's founder, claims the estate of his late grandfather is now also destitute, which they believe is untrue and a result of Annabelle's having spurned his affections. They decide to appeal to their famous alumni for financial help thru a reunion, and invitations are sent. Many could help; but surely not Lucius Jordan, a timid lad who loved Annabelle too but dropped out under pressure from Ware. What they don't know is, he's now Louis Jordan, king of swing and leader of the Tympani Band. By accident, Jordan and his band's train is sidelined in Ware for repairs and when he learns of the college's plight, he agrees to pitch in. Though the stuffy faculty are unaware of his reputation, the kids are, and class attendance soars with Jordan's presence in the classroom. Flames of romance with Annabelle are rekindled. But things start looking bleak: other alumni are all declining to help, and Ware has found out about the fundraising scheme and orders the Dean to resign immediately... The plot serves as a structure for about a dozen swing numbers by Jordan's group, with dancing by the Aristo-Genes Girls' Club.",
