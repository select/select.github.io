      "description": "Chicago's top newspaper reporter (Pat O'Brien) plans to move to New York to take a higher paying advertising job and marry his sweetheart (Mary Brian). But he can't resist going after the story when a high-profile prisoner (George E. Stone) escapes a scheduled hanging. The newspaper's editor (Adolphe Menjou) goes to extraordinary lengths to keep him working on getting the scoop. A wild melee ensues when the possibly-innocent escapee hides in the courthouse press room. Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Adolphe Menjou), and Best Director (Lewis Milestone) I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
