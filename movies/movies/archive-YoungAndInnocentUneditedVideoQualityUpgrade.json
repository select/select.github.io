      "description": "This is the complete 83 minute version which is much sharper and with a smaller download file than the 80 minute print already here at IA. The Hitchcock touch is readily apparent in this highly entertaining romantic thriller spiced with dashes of wry humor. Good cast and good FX with convincing miniatures. Adapted from Josephine Tey's novel, \"A Shilling For Candles.\" One of Hitchcock's last all-British productions before the start of his Hollywood years. P.S. It's easy to spot Hitch in this one. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock Released in 1937 a.k.a. \"The Girl Was Young\" and \"Coins For Candles\" Complete print (original release)",
