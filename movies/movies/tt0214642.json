None believes him, but his nephew wins a model boat building contest and gets to make the model into an actual boat. This is where Uncle Victor comes in, as a supervisor for the construction, and when the funds for the boat fall through, he even chips in to finish the build. Having been constructed in the backyard, however, makes it tough to get to the Seine River. The whole family has to chip in as one thing after another goes awry. What will become of the troublesome boat, and will Victor ever return to the grocery?",
