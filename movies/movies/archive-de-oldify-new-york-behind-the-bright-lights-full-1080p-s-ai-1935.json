      "description": "Many viewers of my films about New York before the war have asked how on earth it was possible to have neon lights show all kinds of patterns and varying texts in an era when there were no computers yet. Especially many such comments can be found under this film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpXnEvW0XD0 In a number of cases I already replied that these probably were electro-mechanical devices consisting of many relays, rotating drums, pins and contacts alike a wind-up music box. This film gives a wonderful insight into how it was actually done! Indeed the drums form part of such systems, but actually these \"motograph\" systems are even more complex than one would expect. You will surely enjoy this detailed explanation by the Chevrolet Motor Company who operated a huge 23 stories high billboard around 1935. The original film has been motion-stabilized, restored, enhanced and colorized with A.I. video software. Source: Library Of Congress. Music: Original spoken American soundtrack",
