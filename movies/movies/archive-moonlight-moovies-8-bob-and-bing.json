      "description": "MOONLIGHT MOOVIES #8 is a complete drive-in program. We offer a couple of classic comedies this time, featuring the beloved duo of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Following a grab bag of coming (or not) attractions, settle in for \"Cheese Burglar,\" starring Herman the mouse. Our first feature (“My Favorite Brunette”) finds baby photographer Ronnie Jackson (Hope) on Death Row, explaining to reporters how he ended up there. It all started with Jackson hanging out in the neighboring office of private detective Sam McCloud. In walks Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour), who believes Ronnie is an actual detective. He’s too cowardly to admit the truth, and soon ends up tangling with Lon Chaney, Jr., and Peter Lorre. Keep your eye peeled for some uncredited cameos. After a very brief intermission, we find ourselves trekking “The Road to Bali.”  Rushing from Melbourne in order to avoid various marriage proposals, two song-and-dance men sign on for work as divers. They stop on an idyllic island on the way to Bali where they vie with each other for the favors of Princess Lala. A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels which arouses the less romantic interest of some shady locals.  Please drive carefully as you exit, and come again soon!",
