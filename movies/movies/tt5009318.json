      "description": "The Yank - Shot on location in Cleveland, Dublin and County Clare, Ireland, \"The Yank\" is a farcical satire on Irish America and it's \"paddywhackery.\" It's the story of Tom Murphy, a middle-aged Cleveland bachelor whose view of Ireland comes from The Quiet Man, starring John Wayne. He also tends to let the expectations of his family get in the way of finding true love. So when his best friend, Marty, decides to get married in Ireland, Tom's family and friends send him off on a side splitting epic adventure. Tom does not know it yet, but he's about to come face to face with the real Ireland.\n2014: Stars: Colm Meaney, Fred Willard, Kevin P. Farley\n**Under license from Vision Films Inc.
