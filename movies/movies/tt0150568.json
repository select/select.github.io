The docent is voiced by Mel Blanc, who does a voice midway between Sylvester the Cat and Jerry Colonna, as he rambles on about stewed clams reeling out of a saloon, and carps directing traffic. Theyre traffic carps, get it?That's about it for this one. There are a few puns that are funny the first time, if you haven't beat the carp to the punchline.",
