      "description": "Around 1900, two bandits are nearly chased to death by unknown pursuers after a train robbery. They escape to Bolivia with a friend, rob banks again, and are finally caught by the militia and their persistent pursuer.   An impressively photographed tragicomic Western with plenty of humor that doesn't capitalize on the deeper potential of the theme of relentless chase and escape, instead remaining on the surface of successful entertainment.",
