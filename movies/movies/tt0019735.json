      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Bulldog Drummond is an adventure/crime film that spawned a long running series of movies. While this wasn't the first film to attempt to capture the popularity of the series of mystery novels on which it was based, this was the first attempt with sound, which helped launch the series. Lead actor Ronald Colman would be given an Oscar nod for his role in the picture. ",
