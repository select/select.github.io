      "description": "This is the tale of a young woman who abandons her fiancé, and runs off with a circus performer. Things do not end well. The movie was heavily censored when originally shown in the US due to its erotic content. It is notable for the natural acting style of Asta Nielsen, a method unseen at the time in American cinema. There are many missing and degraded frames due to deterioration of the nitrate-based film used in making the picture. Stars: Asta Nielsen, Poul Reumert, Hans Neergaard, Robert Dinesen, Emilie Sannom, and Oscar Stribolt IMDb Page The intertitles are in Danish. English subtitles are listed as SUBRIP and via the torrent file.",
