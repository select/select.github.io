    "Plot": "When the Groundhog tells his radio listeners there will be six more weeks of long underwear, the ducks decide to fly south. Farmer Al Falfa has a gun and wants a nice duck dinner, much to his regret in this funny Terrytoon.This is a fine and funny cartoon from Terry's up-and-coming co-directors, George Gordon and Mannie Davis. Looking at it, however, you see that the ducks are quite wacky, and they're black mallards.... and it's a month before Tex Avery's PORKY'S DUCK HUNT was released, starring the neophyte Daffy Duck. It looks like a coincidence to me. Clearly they all used little black ducks for better visual contrast and because Disney's Donald was a white duck. However the aggressive and funny ways that Terry's and Schlesinger's ducks behaved made it clear that each knew how to produce a cartoon... but Schlesinger's staff knew how to produce that far more valuable commodity, a star.",
