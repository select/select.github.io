      "description": "The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery is a 1959 heist film, directed by Charles Guggenheim and starring Steve McQueen. It does have noirish undertones at some points and it is a good film so I have uploaded it.    Based on a 1953 bank robbery attempt of Southwest Bank in St. Louis, the film was shot on location in 1958 with some of the men and women from the St. Louis Police Department, as well as local residents and bank employees, playing the same parts they did in the actual robbery attempt.  Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_St._Louis_Bank_Robbery Suggested Film Noirs: http://bit.ly/2tLevkl The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.
