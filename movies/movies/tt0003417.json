Both are extremely fond of Mabel, and after a tiff between the two men, the cobbler puts Limburger cheese into the grocer's shoes. His plan works, as the offensive smell forces the grocer to leave the party, and the cobbler has Mabel all to himself. But the grocer discovers the cheese, returns and smears the cobblers face with the gooey smell, and has the last laugh, as Mabel faints into his arms.",
