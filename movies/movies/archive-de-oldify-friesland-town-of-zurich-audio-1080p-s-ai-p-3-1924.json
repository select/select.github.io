      "description": "The original title of this video said \"Beautiful Zurich in Friesland\", because Zurich was mentioned as the main topic in the original Beeld En Geluid video. Probably this was because the film starts with the statue of the \"Steenen Man\" which is not far away from Zurich on the dyke to Harlingen. Just to note that the village of Zurich is not to be confused with the city of Zürich in Switzerland. Its name also doesn't have an umlaut on top of the letter \"u\". However, the main part of this film deals with the towns of Bolsward and Sloten in the same Dutch province of Friesland in the North of my country. The locations and street names are still to be determined. Any help with tthe timeline will be appreciated. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, restored, enhanced and colorized by means of modern A.I. video software.
