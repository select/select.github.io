    "Plot": "This totally silent remake of popular folk play is stunningly beautiful when it comes to visual issues. Young Eino Kari as cinematographer can be very proud of his first work.Erkki Karu's direction is stable but the story really doesn't work with this early tech of movie making as the lines grow long and the scenes remain empty. Nowadays the melodrama seems way too naive to be taken seriously and can't compete with Valentin Vaala's strong and personal works which took over a decade later.Still Erkki Karu's achievements like \"Nuori luotsi\" shouldn't be underrated. They did build the base for all Finnish film.",
