    "Plot": "Waffles the Cat and Don Dog are relaxing in a hammock, which they have tied between the legs of their camel, when the camel suddenly kicks them off onto the Egyptian sand. Don spots a pool of water, and the three of them dance over to it. Once there, they fight over who gets to drink it. Waffles ties the camel's neck in a knot and finally punches him in the face, until the poor animal is dead. A bird, posing as a small tree, drinks the water and flies away. Then a sphinx suddenly glides across the desert and angrily declares, \"You killed him!\" Waffles tries to blame Don, but the desert is suddenly filled with frightening images of pyramids and stampeding camels. Suddenly, Waffles and Don fall through black emptiness until they find themselves inside an Egyptian tomb. There, Waffles shakes with fear, and Don looks on with detached curiosity, as skeletons dance, play the piano and a variety of other weird things.",
