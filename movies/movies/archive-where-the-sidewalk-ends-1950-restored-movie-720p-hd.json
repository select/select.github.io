      "description": "Where the Sidewalk Ends is a 1950 American film noir directed and produced by Otto Preminger . The screenplay for the film was written by Ben Hecht , and adapted by Robert E. Kent, Frank P. Rosenberg, and Victor Trivas . The screenplay and adaptations were based on the novel Night Cry by William L. Stuart. The film stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney . Andrews plays Mark Dixon, a ruthless and cynical metropolitan police detective who despises all criminals because his father was one, and finds himself trying to cover up his own accidental killing of a suspect in a murder case. Considered a classic of the genre, the film displays a brand of violence \"lurking below urban society\" considered an important noir motif.",
