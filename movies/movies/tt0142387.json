    "Plot": "Oswald has to substitute for the organ grinder's monkey in this very early sound Oswald the Talking Rabbit cartoon.Although the gags are well coordinated to the music, this is more of an experimental film, an effort by Lantz and his team, which was still being assembled at this point, to see if they could produce a sound cartoon to compete with the senior sound cartoons: Disney's Mickey Mouse, Van Beuren's Aesop's Fables, which had been at least occasional soundies for a few months before Mickey's debut, and the Fleischer Brothers' Screen Songs, which they had been producing since 1924.Although the gags are well timed for the purely musical background, the animation is very crude, and the backgrounding is primitive. The net effect is poor. Lantz would assemble his team and get better fast, but except for some historical interest, this is not worth your time.",
