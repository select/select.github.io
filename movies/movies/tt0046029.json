Arthur Rank Organisation Release Date: 5 August 1954 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1 In 1942, Britain was clinging to the island of Malta since it was critical to keeping Allied supply lines open. The Axis also wanted it for their own supply lines. Plenty of realistic reenactments and archival combat footage as the British are beseiged and try to fight off the Luftwaffe. Against this background, a Royal Air Force reconnaissance photographer's romance with a local girl is endangered as he tries to plot enemy movements.",
