Then, we're in an elegant room with a chandelier where Paul Tremaine is directing the Aristocrats in their arrangement of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\" It's a 15-piece orchestra. They follow with \"Road to Mandalay\" and a medley of songs one might hear on a Mississippi riverboat. The medley includes \"Old Kentucky Home,\" \"Oh Susanna,\" and \"Mississippi Mud,\" among others. The music includes a few vocals from a trio of musicians.",
