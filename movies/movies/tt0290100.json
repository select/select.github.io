    "Plot": "Orson Welles' Vienna (1968)*** (out of 4) When reviewing the career of Orson Welles it's always shocking to see how many great movies he made when able to but it's even more shocking when you look at the countless films that he started and never was able to fix. This short runs a brief 8-minutes and features the legend walking around Vienna and showing off some of his favorite locations. This includes showing us a man who has fed the birds everyday for fifteen-years. Welles also shows us one of his favorite pastry shops. From here there's even a brief mention of THE THIRD MAN before we end the short with a spy spoof featuring Mickey Rooney.Yeah, there's obviously nothing too special here but it's still worth watching just because of how captivating Welles is as the host. He certainly demands your attention with that deep voice and those incredible eyes. Information wise I'd argue that there's nothing too impressive here and your typical TravelTalks short would be better. With that said, it's interesting hearing Welles discuss THE THIRD MAN and it's even more entertaining getting to see him and Rooney act. Just think where both were in 1941 compared to where they were at the time of this being shot.",
