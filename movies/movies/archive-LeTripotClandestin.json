      "description": "A combination gambling den and bawdy house is set up so that croupiers, patrons, prostitutes, and the owner can quickly change it all into a mercantile establishment when the cops stage a raid. The women become shop girls and customers, the men become clerks and shoppers. The craps table becomes a long counter. The police do raid the joint, and the nearly-instantaneous conversion into a dry goods store covers all the evidence. The police leave in dismay and disgust. But will they be back? What is their real motive? Also Known As (AKA) Le tripot clandestin France (original title) Az illegális szerencsejátékosok paradicsoma paradicsoma Hungary The Scheming Gambler's Paradise USA",
