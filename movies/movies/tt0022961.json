      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Also known as Three Broadway Girls, The Greeks Had a Word for Them inspired four other films which had a similar plot. This version follows a group of three Broadway women who try to nab either rich husbands or sugar daddies, but keep foiling each other. The film was repeatedly censored before and after release due to puritanical views of the time, even with the lax enforcement of the pre-code era. Modern viewers like the actresses but feel overall that it is a good, but not great, movie.",
