      "description": "Whether They’re from Mars or Planet X those dastardly aliens are out to get us. The proof is in this simulated double feature program at an inner-city second-run theater. The future shock begins with coming attractions and a cartoon. Then evil aliens in satin Cossack shirts let loose a mini-plague of zombies in “Plan 9 From Outer Space.” Followed by an invisible alien in a visible diving helmet raising hell in Southern California in “Phantom From Space”. We need a border wall in space! NOTE: The superior quality print of “Phantom From Space” used in this simulation will soon be available as a separate item.",
