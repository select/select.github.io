Raised by fierce lions, the boy grows into a powerful man; however, when money-obsessed businessman, Neil Forbes, arrives in Africa, his men manage to capture the lion-man and his loyal feline companions. Now, as the rare specimens are on display at a circus, the untamed man, now called Kaspa, begins to feel nostalgia for his beloved forest, and nothing can stop him from returning to his roots--not even fire. Will Kaspa, the king of the jungle, find his way back to Africa?",
