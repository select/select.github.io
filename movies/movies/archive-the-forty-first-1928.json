      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. 1918, during the Russian Civil War: Central Asia. A detachment of soldiers of the Bolshevik Red faction are being pursued by the conservative White army. The best sniper of the Red detachment, Maryutka, is entrusted with guarding a captured White officer. When they are the only two left alive, how will she remain in control of this unruly prisoner? Considered a classic of Russian silent cinema, this picture was remade again in 1956. The download includes an English subtitle track. ",
