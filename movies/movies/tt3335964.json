Their unconditional love for Punk Princess Debbie and the raw power of Alternative Rockabilly Music are the only statements of freedom in this little nowhere town. Everything else around them is boundaries and pressure. But they decide to run and live their truth. This film has a big cast of great young actors, intense emotions, and an original soundtrack by German rockabilly bands.",
