      "description": "Dementia is a black and white film from 1955. It is a silent film and there is not a single line of dialogue in the entire film, nor are there any storyboards to tell the viewer what is going on. The film was later re-released under the title Daughter of Horror and had the dubious benefit of an added narration.
