      "description": "Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton team up as hotel bellhops. Some interesting props, including a horse-drawn elevator. Decent gags, culminating with a classic chase scene. The movie is not a classic, but it's typical Arbuckle and Keaton and a good illustration of the kind of comedy they did together. The IMDb entry is at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008874/",
