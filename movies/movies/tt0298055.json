      "description": "Sorry for the poor quality THIS FILM IS LOOSELY BASED ON A REAL LIFE EVENT! Plot:  Corrupt police agent Pancho catches two colombian traffickers and uses them to widen his network of crime and vice. IMPORTANT BACKGROUND NOTE:  On   January   14 ,  1982   the   bodies   of   13   men   were   found   on   the   borders   of   a   drainage   canal   in   the   Tula   River . The   bodies   showed   signs   of   extreme   torture   and   mutilation ,  some   of   them   with   their   heads   still   conserved   in   plastic   bags .  Some   were   decapitated ,  others   slashed   with   machetes ,  most   with   a   shot   to   the   head .  The   facts   of   what   was   to   be   known   as  the  \" Tula   River   massacre \"  were   denounced   by   J .  Gonzales   Gonzales ,  who   accused   his   boss ,  Arturo   Durazo   Moreno ,  the   then   Mexico   City   police   chief ,  of   being   the   intellectual   author   of   the   ghastly   crime .  Moreno   was   the   chief   of   police   in   Mexico   City   during   the   administration   of   his   friend ,  President   José   López   Portillo . The   dead ,  apparently   all   Colombians ,  formed   a   band   of   criminals   that   was   exploited   by   Moreno ,   who   hid   them   in   jail   and   released   them   to   rob   banks   repeatedly .  It   was   said   that   Durazo   decided   to   keep   the   loot ,  and   do   away   with   the   Colombians   and   their   Mexican   taxi   driver   who   also   disappeared ,  last   seen   in   June   1981   by   his   mother . It   was   said   that   the   group   were   held   in   secret   jails   and   the   La   Castaneda   psychiatric   hospital ,  tortured   and   murdered ,  then   dumped   into   the   sewer   in   Mexico   City .  Their   decomposed   remains   were   later   fished   out   of   the   Tula   river   by   a   Red   Cross   diving   team .  Arturo Durazo was considered one of the most incompetent, corrupt chief of police at the time. ",
