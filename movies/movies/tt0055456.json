      "description": "“Rarely dull” “Pretty good horror quickie” “Cheap little snake horror” “Poor” (IMDB reviews quotes). This is an Ed Wood movie. That is if Ed had been British, had this mostly competent cast and he had been able to write coherent dialog. The plot is right out of the Ed Wood school of low-budget, off-the-wall movie making. If you’re trapped for an hour with absolutely nothing else to do, watch this movie. It probably won’t bore you into thoughts of suicide. IMDB rating 4.9. Directed by Sidney J Furie. Released in 1961. Complete print. AKA “Terror of the Snake Woman”",
