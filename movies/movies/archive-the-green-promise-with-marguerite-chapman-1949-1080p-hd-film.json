      "description": "Mr. Matthews (Walter Brennan) is a farmer who is constantly being encouraged to update his work practices with newer technology. Staunchly dedicated to the time-honored methods that he knows, Matthews, a widower, raises his family in a similarly old-fashioned manner. Over time, his extremely stubbor n ways begin to alienate his children, who are growing up whether he likes it or not. Eventually, he has to learn to loosen up and change with the times or risk pushing his kids away.",
