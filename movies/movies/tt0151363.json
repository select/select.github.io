      "description": "The industrious little red hen is always on the move while the other farm animals just lay around and sleep. She finds a grain of wheat, plants it, harvests the wheat crop, shucks the wheat, grinds it, and then bakes a loaf of bread. When the time comes for the bread to be eaten, the farm animals want a share of it, but all they get from the little red hen is a lecture about when there is bread to be baked, don't loaf on the job. This proves just how hard-working the little red hen really is...not many would do that much work just to be able to make a bad pun. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/little-red-hen-1955/",
