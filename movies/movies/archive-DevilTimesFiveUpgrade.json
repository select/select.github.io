      "description": "Variously known as “Peopletoys” (original title), and “Devil Times Five” (elsewhere in the Archive), this print is titled “The Horrible House on the Hill.” My source claims an aspect ratio of   1.78:1. It’s a clearer print, with better color reproduction, than the others already here. Stars include future teen heartthrob Leif Garrett, his mother Carolyn Stellar and sister Dawn Lyn; Shelley Morrison (“Rosario” on “Will and Grace);” and Sorrell Booke (“Boss Hogg.”)",
