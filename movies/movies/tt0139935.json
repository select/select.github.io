    "Plot": "Two lovers perform a fandango dance. A jealous quarrel follows and the heart-broken swain decides to end it all. He throws himself from the window of his room, but instead of being killed the anchor of a passing balloon intercepts his flight and he is taken up high into the clouds. Laughing at the poor, unfortunate mortal, the moon arouses the anger of the desperate lover and a battle between the two ensues. The moon seems to get the worst of it and a comet appears, transforming into a beautiful woman, who remonstrates with him for the trouble caused. The moon enters a complaint against her antagonist and three stars sit as judges to hear the case. The legal battle is terminated in favor of the lover. He, however, implores the pardon of the court and is discharged, whereupon he drops down to earth into the arms of his sweetheart, who is glad to see him.",
