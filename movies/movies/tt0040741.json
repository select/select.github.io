Fox is Robin Hoodlum and the Crow is the Sheriff pursuing R. Hoodlum and his merry band. He escapes one trap after another until he is lured into an archery contest at the Palace---everybody plays the Palace sooner or later---and caught. He escapes, through the efforts of his faithful followers, and they kidnap the Sheriff and the King to act as their servants.",
