        "Charlie Chaplin's 29th Released Oct. 26 1914 The story involves Chaplin and Chester Conklin working as waiters at a restaurant where the cooks go on strike. When the two are forced to work as bakers, the striking cooks put dynamite in the dough, with explosive results. Dough and Dynamite was one of two Charlie Chaplin films that were to be shown at a special event in September, 2001. However, in the light of 9/11, it was taken off the list of films as it ends with Charlie walking out of a blown up building. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0003863/",

Williams Edited by Sydney Chaplin Charles Chaplin (uncredited) Distributed by Mutual Film Corporation Release date October 26, 1914 Running time 33 minutes Country United States Languages Silent film English (Original titles) Box office $130,000 Dough and Dynamite is a 1914 American comedy silent film made by Keystone Studios starring Charlie Chaplin . Plot The story involves Chaplin and Chester Conklin working as waiters at a restaurant. Charlie is especially inept and his comic carelessness enrages the customers. The workers in the restaurant's bakery go on strike for more pay, but are fired by the unsympathetic proprietor. Charlie is put to work in the bakery where his lack of skills upsets his boss and co-worker Chester Conklin. Meanwhile, the vengeful strikers have arranged to smuggle a loaf of bread concealing a stick of dynamite into the bakery. During a free-for-all involving Charlie, Chester, and their boss, the dynamite dramatically explodes. At the end of the film, Charlie emerges groggily from a pile of sticky dough. Mack Sennett's recollections In Mack Sennett's 1954 autobiography, King of Comedy , he recalled he was absent from Keystone Studios for most of the filming of Dough and Dynamite . Before Sennett left, he put Chaplin and Conklin jointly in charge of creating a new comedy with basically no guidelines. The two comedians began creating a film in which each man was a roominghouse boarder competing against one another in trying to woo the landlady, but they abandoned the idea after a short time. When they saw a \"help wanted\" sign outside a local bakery, the idea of a slapstick comedy set within a bakery came to both men almost simultaneously. Sennett claimed, however, that it was his idea to have a stick of dynamite concealed in a loaf of bread. Sennett declared Dough and Dynamite to be Chaplin's breakout film with Keystone. Reviews The New York Dramatic Mirror praised Chaplin's efforts in Dough and Dynamite , writing, \"In a comparatively short time, Charles Chaplin has earned a reputation as a slapstick comedian second to none. His odd little tricks of manner and his refusal to do the most simple things in an ordinary way are essential features of his method, which thus far has defied successful imitation.\" [ citation needed ] Moving Picture World commented, \"Two reels of pure nonsense, some of which is very laughable indeed. Chas. Chaplin appears as a waiter in a French restaurant and bakery. He has a terrible time breaking dishes and getting the dough over the floor. The bakers go on strike and at the last the whole place is blown up by dynamite. This is well-pictured and very successful for this form of humor.\" [ citation needed ] Cast Charlie Chaplin - Waiter Chester Conklin - Jacques Fritz Schade - Monsieur La Vie, Bakery Owner Norma Nichols - Mme.

    "Plot": "The bakers in the employ of Monsieur La Vie go on strike. In the emergency Pierre and Jacques, the waiters, take possession of the kitchen, and as there is quite a bit of jealousy between them, on account of the female waitresses who smile impartially on both. It is not long before the dough is flying. Meanwhile, the strikers have conspired. They drill a hole in a loaf of bread and insert therein a stick of dynamite, cleverly replacing the piece of crust on the end of the loaf. Then they give it to a little girl, instructing her to carry it to the bakery and explaining that because the bread is too heavy her mother has sent it back. The wife of Monsieur La Vie returns the child's money and orders are given to the bakers to put the loaf back in the oven and bake it some more. They comply. The whole establishment is in a demoralized state. Customers in the café cannot get waited upon. The cook is in a towering temper. Pierre is clubbed on the head by the strikers, and goes about in a maudlin condition, getting himself and everybody else into all sorts of trouble. And then, the dynamited loaf explodes. The innocent victims are buried in splintered ovens, broken china an earthquake of pastry and bursting flour sacks, and huge mounds of dough heave fitfully where human hearts once throbbed. At the very end of the tragedy we see the yeasty mass churning and swelling, and then, out of the sticky lump, the unfortunate Pierre thrusts a gluey head.",
