      "description": "The ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) tele-movie event Dangerous Remedy tells the fascinating story of Dr Bertram Wainer. Living and working in Melbourne in the 1960s, Dr Wainer put his life at risk to expose police corruption in an effort to change the law on abortion and put an end to the illegal operations that were killing young women.\n\nIt’s a truly inspiring story. Dr Wainer’s determination, even when his own life and that of his family’s was threatened, never faltered. He was living proof that one person can make a difference and change the status quo.\n\nWith the support of Dr Wainer’s family, the filmmakers have endeavored to capture the essence of his struggle to expose police corruption and change the law.\n\nStarring Jeremy Sims, Susie Porter, William McInnes, Maeve Dermody, Peter O’Brien and Gary Sweet, Dangerous Remedy is an intelligent thriller with danger, suspense, complex characters, contradictions and romance.\n\n#freemovies #moviesondemand #fullmovie",
