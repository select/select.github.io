Later Pike and Shorty are accosted by Molly Jones, whose brother, Ethelbert, actually is a missing sailor. Deeming her an impostor, they elude her by slipping into a nearby cafe. Jimmylegs, the bosun's mate, follows, intending to arrest them because the street woman complained when Pike and Shorty reclaimed the money. There Jimmylegs loses his roll of money, and he chases Molly, suspecting her to be a thief. Molly, Pike, and Shorty end up at Ma Pike's chicken farm. Pike and Molly fall in love. Then it is revealed that Jimmylegs is Molly's long-lost brother, Ethelbert, and all ends happily.",
