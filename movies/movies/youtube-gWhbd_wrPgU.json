      "description": "A troupe of struggling aspiring actors—including Norman (William Holden), Marge (Barbara Britton), and Tony (James Brown), Kate (Susan Hayward), Dottie (Martha O’Driscoll), George (Eddie Bracken) —share a Greenwich Village apartment, enforcing a strict “no romance” rule... until Marge and Tony’s secret marriage and a surprise visit from Dottie's judgmental father upend their plans. Chaos erupts when clueless George barges in mid-shower, sparking a madcap scramble to disguise their co-ed living situation, while producer Arthur Kenny (Robert Benchley) gets tangled in the farce. Lies spiral, doors slam, and the gang’s Broadway dreams hinge on improvising their way through parental interrogations and mistaken identities.\n\n\nOriginal title: Young and Willing \n\nColorized version: https://youtu.be/QdQ1mXGcuac\n\n\nDirector: Edward H.
