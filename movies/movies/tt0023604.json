      "title": "Tombstone Canyon (1932) | Colorized Public Domain Western with Ken Maynard and the Phantom Bandit",
      "description": "Tombstone Canyon (1932) is a Pre-Code American Western film directed by Alan James and starring Ken Maynard. This restored and colorized edition of the public domain classic revives one of the early 1930s B-Westerns that combined action, suspense, and mystery in the rugged landscapes of Arizona. Known for its blend of traditional Western storytelling and masked-villain intrigue, the film remains a valuable glimpse into the cinematic traditions of the early sound era. With this colorized restoration, audiences in the USA, Europe, and beyond can rediscover a film that blends the open-range adventure of the Western with the pulp mystery sensibilities of its time.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe story follows Ken (Ken Maynard), a wandering cowboy who finds himself entangled in the violent conflicts of Tombstone Canyon. The peaceful desert settlement is plagued by raids from a mysterious masked figure known only as the Phantom Bandit. This outlaw spreads fear across the canyon, striking without warning and vanishing before justice can be served.\n\nAs Ken investigates, he discovers that the bandit’s vendetta is deeply personal and tied to hidden family secrets. Along the way, Ken forms a bond with Jenny Morgan (Cecilia Parker), a courageous ranch owner whose land and livelihood are threatened by the ongoing attacks. Guided by his sense of justice, Ken must confront both hired gunmen and the masked Phantom to bring peace to Tombstone Canyon.\n\nThe film builds to a dramatic revelation where the true identity of the Phantom Bandit is uncovered, exposing a tragic past of betrayal and vengeance. Combining fistfights, horse chases, and tense standoffs, the film showcases both the action and melodrama that characterized early B-Westerns.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: Alan James\n• Cinematography: Ted D. McCord\n• Editing: Charles J. Hunt\nStarring:\n• Ken Maynard as Ken\n• Cecilia Parker as Jenny Morgan\n• Sheldon Lewis as The Phantom Bandit\n• Jack Rockwell as Sheriff\n• Frank Brownlee as Morgan\n• Henry Hall as Old Man\n• Edward Coxen as Deputy\n\nFilm Significance:\nTombstone Canyon is emblematic of the low-budget but highly popular Westerns of the early 1930s. These films catered to Depression-era audiences seeking escapism through tales of frontier justice, moral clarity, and thrilling gunfights. Ken Maynard, one of the era’s most recognized cowboy stars, brought a charismatic screen presence and horsemanship that made him a favorite with Western fans. The inclusion of a masked villain shows the influence of pulp serials on the genre, foreshadowing later Western-mystery hybrids.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
