Even the military police was sent from the north to free the city from the terror regime of the gang of Oss. When they discover sex crimes and fraud even amongst the local clerics and prominent members of the community, the conflict escalates between the Catholic south and the Protestant north that eventually leads to the fall of the 'Colijn' administration, the last operating pre-war administration. During this, a young woman named Johanna wants to escape from the web of crime that surrounds her. The harder she tries, the deeper she sinks into fraud, prostitution, and even murder she gets stuck in fraud, prostitution, manslaughter and even murder.",
