      "description": "\"Sword of Lancelot\" (known as \"Lancelot and Guineveret\" in the UK) is a British film starring Cornel Wilde, his real-life wife at the time, Jean Wallace, and Brian Aherne. This lesser-known version of the Camelot legend is a work almost solely made by Cornel Wilde, who co-produced, directed, co-wrote, and played Lancelot.\n\nLancelot is King Arthur's most valued Knight of the Round Table and a paragon of courage and virtue. Things change, however, when he falls for Guinevere (Wallace), bride of Arthur (Brian Aherne, who had essayed this character previously in 1954's Prince Valiant), and she for him.\n\nMade ten years after Richard Thorpe's film Knights of the Round Table, the illicit romance this time is portrayed as a more intimate affair, and the sword fights have a more menacing reality (Wilde was an excellent fencer). A sub-plot concerns Arthur's effort to forestall a challenge from a rival king, a problem that will inevitably catch Lancelot up in a personal conflict.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Jacques Tourneur and Mario Bava, produced by Bruno Vailati, written by Alberto Barsanti (story), Ennio De Concini (writer), Augusto Frassinetti (writer), Raffaello Pacini (story) and Bruno Vailati (writer), starring Steve Reeves as Phillipides (Phidippides), Mylène Demongeot as Andromeda (Creuso's daughter), Sergio Fantoni as Theocritus, Daniela Rocca as Charis, Philippe Hersent as Callimachus, Alberto Lupo as Miltiades, Daniele Vargas as Darius I (King of Persia), Miranda Campa as Andromeda's handmaid, Gianni Loti as Teucro, Anita Todesco as Andromeda's friend, Ivo Garrani as Creuso, Sergio Ciani as Euros, Franco Fantasia, Carlo Lombardi, Ignazio Balsamo, Gian Paolo Rosmino and Walter Grant.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"Lancelot and Guinevere\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
