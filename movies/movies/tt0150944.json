      "description": "Life on Krazy's small but happy Polynesian island largely consists of non-stop music making. Though the only proper instrument seen is a ukulele, Krazy, his girlfriend Kitty, birds, bugs and monkeys coax music out of everything from worms to houses to rings in the native women's noses. At the end, Krazy has a brief scrap with an alligator, resulting in the standard \"turns-into-suitcase\" gag. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/honolulu-wiles-1930/",
