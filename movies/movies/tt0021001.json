      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Betty Compson leads this film as a spy for the German government during World War I. Her mission is to infiltrate the British territory of Gibraltar to sabotage the British fleet. Compson's performance in the film has been praised, but the plot has a couple twists that don't always work in its favor.  I've uploaded two versions of this film, one with superior sound quality, but which cuts out all title and ending cards and location cards. The other has certain scenes that are indecipherable due to the poor audio preservation. ",
