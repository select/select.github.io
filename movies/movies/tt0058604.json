      "description": "A Soviet-Cuban two-part feature film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov, released in 1964. The film was shot after the triumph of the Cuban revolution, the advent of the socialist regime in Cuba, and allied relations between Cuba and the USSR.\n\nPlot-wise, it consists of four unrelated novellas that tell the story of the Cubans fighting against \"American oppressors\" to turn their country into the Island of Liberty. In the 1960s, due to the rise of socialist ideals, the theme of revolution became relevant both for Soviet and Western cinema.\nThe film is made on a high professional level, primarily due to the innovations of DP Sergey Urusevsky and his crew. This was the last time Urusevsky, and director Kalatozov worked together. The films’s production was challenging in regards to staging, camerawork, intraframe editing, hand-held shooting for creating dynamic scenes using a hand-held camera in motion and transferring it from hand to hand, using specially made engineering structures, etc.\n\nThe film was shot between 1963 and 1964 with a considerable support from the Soviet and Cuban authorities during one of the most strained episodes of the Cold War - the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US blockade of the island, and the difficult economic situation in Cuba.\n\nYear of production: 1964\n\nDirected by: Mikhail Kalatozov\nWritten by: Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Enrique Pineda Barnet\nDirector of photography: Sergei Urusevsky\nMusic: Carlos Fariñas\nProduction designer: Yevgeni Svidetelev\nStarring: Sergio Corrieri, José Gallardo, Raúl García, Salvador Wood, Luz María Collazo, Jean Bouise, Celia Rodriguez\n\nThe film was digitally restored by Mosfilm Cinema Concern\nFind out more: https://cg.mosfilm.ru/en\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel, and be sure to click the bell so that you won’t miss the best Soviet movies!\n\n#FullMoviesWithEngSubs #Cuba #Kalatozov",

    "Plot": "This study of Cuba--partially written by renowned poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko--captures the island just before it made the transition to a post-revolutionary society. Moving from city to country and back again, I AM CUBA examines the various problems caused by political oppression as well as by great discrepancies in wealth and power. Beginning in Havana in the pre-Castro era, we see how foreigners contributed to the city's prostitution and poverty; this sequence features dreamy, hallucinogenic camera work that creates a feeling of unease and dislocation. Then, in glorious images of palm tress and fertile land, the film looks at the sugar cane fields in the countryside, and the difficulties faced by peasants working the land. Finally, back in the city again, leftist students battle the police and a corrupt government--and pay a high price for their rebellion.",
