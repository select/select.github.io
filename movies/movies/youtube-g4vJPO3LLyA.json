      "description": "Plucky paper pusher Sarah Jane McKinney (Leslie Bibb) lands a great promotion after innocently killing her boss, Milo Beeber (Brandon Routh), and soon she's employing her talent for treachery to scale the Judge Pharmaceuticals ladder. In this black comedy, the executives drop like flies as Sarah Jane beats a path to the confessional of Father Grisham (Barry Bostwick). But the game gets dicey when she falls for cop Bill Malloy (Adam Goldberg).\n\nDirector: Abram Cox\nWriter: Doug Steinberg\nStars: Leslie Bibb, Adam Goldberg, Kathy Baker, Brandon Routh\n2010\n\nEdited for YouTube ad standards\r\n\r\nMORE Popcornflix MOVIES, FREE on YouTube!\r\n\r\n Action: https://bit.ly/2XC8pvv\r\n Romance: https://bit.ly/2NVnIQ2\r\n Horror: https://bit.ly/2LeNNaK\r\n Crime: https://bit.ly/2NK201z\r\n Drama: https://bit.ly/2G6Uasy\r\n Comedy:  https://bit.ly/2LPCNQD\r\n Western: https://bit.ly/2S7FRc4\r\n Popcornflix Channel page: https://bit.ly/2Saak9p\r\n\r\nWatch more free movies and TV series at Popcornflix.com, or on the Popcornflix app available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Chromecast, and AppleTV.\r\n\r\n#Popcornflix, Full length free movies and TV series.\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Popcornflix\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Popcornflixnews\r\nPopcornflix is owned/operated by Screen Media Ventures",
