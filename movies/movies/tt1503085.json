    "Plot": "A Musical Melange (1929) ** 1/2 (out of 4) This Vitaphone short features the Kjerulf Mayfair Quintette in their only film performance and a quick Google search really didn't turn up too much on them. Their act is basically five women, three on a harp, one on a violin and another that does the singing. The songs performed are \"Sextette,\" \"Neapolitan Night\" and \"Lonely Little Bluebird,\" which must have been what they were remembered for as this here did turn up a few other mentions across the internet. It's always funny watching these Vitaphone shorts because quite often you're seeing a group, act or person who might have made pennies on a vaudeville stage and this one film is all that we can really remember them for. The music here, is, what you'd call \"sweet\" I guess. It's pretty simple and slow but I reckon if you needed to come down from an angry rage that the music would put you in a somber mood. I think fans who enjoy going through these Vitaphone films should at least be slightly entertained.",
