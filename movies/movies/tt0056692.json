      "description": "An old geezer recalls some of the antics of the men and women of his western town, more wild and woolly than Tombstone or Dodge City. In this town, no one is a good shot, the women are hungry for new meat, and practical jokers abound. A stranger strolls into town, proving resistant to the mayhem and, after donning some cowboy duds, begins cleaning up that town. This one actually has some decent production values. Oldbones found no registration for this 1962 movie..",
