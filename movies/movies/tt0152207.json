    "Plot": "A rather Irish sounding Robinson Crusoe tells the details of his voyage to a radio audience: the shipwreck, the beaching, discovering Friday, the brass band, the cannibals; in this nicely formatted Terrytoon.A modern audience will have some problems with the 1930s-style Black cannibals, but John Foster has directed a good, if standard, 1930s cartoon. Foster was another long-time animation man whose earliest credits date from 1925. When Paul Terry had left Van Beuren to form his own studio, Foster had taken over Terry's role as producer. When Van Beuren had lost his cartoon distribution through RKO and given up animation, Foster had gone to Terry. He remained there in various roles, through the 1940s; in fact, he directed the debut of Terry's most famous character, Mighty Mouse.",
