    "Plot": "Johnny Randall, a young race-car driver, falls in love with Tony Bradley, who hates racing because her brother was killed in a midget car-race (the car size, not the driver-size.) To compound that, his mother also objects because his father was killed while racing in the Indianapolis 500. But he continues racing, even though he narrowly escapes death when a rival-and-jealous racer schemes to get rid of him. Then, after these narrow escapes, he loses his nerve, but enters one last race. Is there a gas-station ownership in his future?",
