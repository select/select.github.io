    "Plot": "The prologue says that in the old days, the strong men were Samson and Hercules, but today it is Willoughby Wren, a little wimp with a magic hat that gives him unusual strength. Willoughby has a crush on the trapeze artist in the circus, and gets a job as a handyman, doing such menial tasks as following the parade-elephants with a scoop and a bucket (hey...it's show business) and cleaning the animal cages. When the ferocious ape escapes and goes after the trapeze girl, Willoughby dons his magic cap and goes to the aid of the distressed damsel.",
