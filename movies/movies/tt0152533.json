    "Plot": "Dingbat incites the Bert-Lahr-voiced Fox into reading Aesop's fable of the Fox and the Grapes, nails some bunches to the upper branches of a tree and then frustrates the fox with the usual assort of anvils and scissors in this pretty good Terrytoon.There are some excellent production values in here, including some fine \"candybox\" background work and the usual emphatic goofiness of Philip Scheib's score. Mannie Davis pitches the squawk-laughing Dingbat somewhere between Screwy Squirrel and the Road Runner -- he goes looking for trouble and then punishes his prideful foe. It's possible something might have been done with this series. However, inflation and the competition of television was about to hit Paul Terry's market and the urge to experiment with expensive techniques would vanish.",
