      "description": "What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City (1901) Director: Edwin S. Porter, George S. Fleming What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City is a 1901 American short film starring A. C. Abadie and Florence Georgie in which a woman's undergarments are accidentally exposed. A similar 1901 film, Soubrette's Troubles on a Fifth Avenue Stage, also starred Abadie and Georgie. Plot: The 77-second film depicts a woman, escorted by a man, walking over a grate. The hot air lifts her skirt, she laughs and they walk on. Comparisons: In 2001, Rosemary Hanes and Brian Taves compared the sequence to the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch, writing \"With The Seven Year Itch (1955), the image of Marilyn Monroe's thighs exposed under her  billowing skirt entered American popular culture. The Library's motion  picture and broadcasting collections provide the opportunity to document  not only how women's roles and their depictions have changed throughout  the past hundred years, but also how much has remained the same.\" Tom Gunning contrasts the two events as narrative devices, writing, \"The act of display [in What Happened...]  is both climax and resolution here and does not lead to a series of  incidents or the creation of characters with discernible traits. While  the similar lifting of Marilyn Monroe's skirt in The Seven Year Itch also provides a moment of spectacle, it simultaneously creates character traits that explain later narrative actions.\" -From Wikipedia",

Ladies in crossing this shaft often have their clothes slightly disarranged. A young man is escorting a young lady and talking very earnestly. They walk slowly along until they stand directly over the air shaft. The young lady's skirts are suddenly raised to an almost unreasonable height, greatly to her horror and much to the amusement of the newsboys, bootblacks, and passersby.",
