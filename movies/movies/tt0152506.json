    "Plot": "Krazy Kat is a soda jerk. There are the obligatory scenes from his soda fountain as several kids order various concoctions. One of the kids is his girlfriend who stays after the others leave. She and Krazy dance and then the trouble starts. A wolf shows up in a big sports car. The girlfriend is immediately taken with the guy, and after being wooed, ends up in his penthouse apartment. He tries all kinds of moves on her and she must allow her sense of danger to take over. Krazy must come to the rescue. There is an element of sexuality here that hasn't appeared in anything I have seen of these cartoons. The wolf, of course, has become the symbol of lechery.",
