      "description": "Corri Uomo Corri (1968), also known as Run, Man, Run , is a Spaghetti Western directed by Sergio Sollima. The film revolves around a character named Tomas Milian , who portrays a Mexican bandit named Cuchillo .  Cuchillo, who is adept at avoiding violence, gets caught up in the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution. He discovers that a group of revolutionaries are attempting to steal a large cache of gold intended for the federal army. As the revolution escalates, Cuchillo tries to navigate this treacherous landscape while evading both the revolutionaries and the law. Throughout the film, viewers see Cuchillo's humorous yet cunning tactics to survive, his encounters with various characters, and the moral complexities of the revolution. Eventually, he becomes entangled in the very conflicts he wishes to avoid, leading to a series of action-packed, often satirical, events. It is the second film of Sergio Sollima centred on the character of Cuchillo, again played by Tomas Milian, after the two-years earlier successful western The Big Gundown. It is also the final chapter of the political-western trilogy of Sollima, which includes Face to Face, and his last spaghetti western.",
