      "description": "While preparing to marry his fiancee (for the umpteenth time!), Drummond discovers that there is a treasure buried somewhere in the secret passageways beneath his ancient British estate. When England's most-noted history professor reveals this to Drummond, he is invited to stay at the manor house. He is murdered before he can figure out the meaning of the ancient cypher, and Drummond & Co. have to discover it AND the murderer. A VERY interesting story, with secret passageways, ancient torture devices, and all sorts of \"death-dealing devices\". John Howard, H. B. Warner, E. E. Clive, Leo G. Carroll and many more. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031125/",
