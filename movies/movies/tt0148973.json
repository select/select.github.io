They find him in the snowy north country and he vigorously resists against being arrested, especially by talking magpies. He runs, they pursue, and the chase ends up in Hollywood, where Pierre thinks he is safe in a disguise. But Heckle and Jeckle turn up in the same disguise, and drive Powerful Pierre mad with frustration.",
