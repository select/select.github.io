      "description": "This glitch-free print is sharper than the existing IA copies, and with a smaller download file. A lively, pre-code show business comedy that's one of Buster Keaton's better talkies. One extended sequence qualifies as a slapstick masterpiece. Good supporting cast. Original story by Clarence Kellard. Directed by Edward Sedgwick Released in 1932 Complete print",
