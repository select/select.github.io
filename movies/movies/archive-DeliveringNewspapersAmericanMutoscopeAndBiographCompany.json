      "description": "CREATED/PUBLISHED United States : American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, 1903. SUMMARY The film shows a group of about fifty pre-adolescent boys running and crowding around a one-horse paneled newspaper van that pulls up in the foreground of the picture. On the side of the van is a sign reading \"New York World.\" As they gather around the rear of the vehicle, a fight breaks out between two of the boys. The film ends as the crowd forms around the two fighters. Probably filmed at Union Square. NOTES Copyright: American Mutoscope & Biograph Co.; 24Apr1903; H30745. Duration: 0:53 at 15 fps.
