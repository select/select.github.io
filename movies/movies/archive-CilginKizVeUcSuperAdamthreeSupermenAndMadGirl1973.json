      "description": "This is a very strange Turkish film from 1973. It's sourced from a poor condition VHS tape, so it suffers from the same preservation issues as most all vintage Turkish films. It's recommended for people with an interest in cult cinema and/or old Turkish films. The plot: Super villain \"Mad Girl\", who's dressed in a red Vampira suit, is trying to take over the world. She works for another villain, who's dressed all in red and wears a dime store devil mask. Aiding her in her attempt at world domination is a band of men in green satin Klansman's robes. She also has a robot made out of cardboard boxes. The robot is equipped with a death ray, which causes victims to disappear in a puff of smoke. Battling her are the \"3 Supermen\", scrawny guys who wear ill-fitting bullet proof red suits with an \"S\" on the front. For the better part of an hour the two sides battle each other in a series of spectacular fights. I don't really understand it, but it's entertaining.",
