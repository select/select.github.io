    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie build a bird house, and a sparrow wants to move in. However a mean robin stops him, and then tries to kill him with an arrow.It's a particularly fine Scrappy cartoon from the silly mind of Dick Huemer . All too often, his Scrappies are split in two, and the second half has a tacked-on feel to it, as if he thought \"We really need a plot, so here it is.\" At that point, they often lose their silly, inventive sense. Not this one. This maintains its five-year-old sensibilities all the way through to the end.",
