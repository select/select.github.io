      "description": "Renee Bennett (Amy Schumer) knows what it feels like to be average looking in New York city - a city of the genetically and financially blessed.  After falling off her bike and banging her head during a spin class, she stumbles in  the locker room and it is there that she first sees what has happened - her legs are toned, her hair is silky, her chin is defined - she is GORGEOUS. Except that, to everyone else, she looks EXACTLY THE SAME. Even though her appearance hasn’t changed AT ALL - Renee’s new belief in herself sees her climbing the ranks at the cosmetics company she works for, getting the respect of her impossibly beautiful boss AVERY LECLAIR (Michelle Williams), bagging a cute boyfriend in ETHAN and getting invited to rooftop parties. With her new confidence comes overconfidence, and even the tendency to treat the ‘less genetically fortunate’ in the same dismissive way that people used to treat her. Eventually Renee believes the spell has been lifted - and finally realizes that when she thought she was ugly, she may have been the most beautiful, and when she believed she was beautiful, she had started to turn a bit ugly. She learns that true beauty is not skin deep.\n\n2018 | Directors: Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein | Stars: Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams, Emily Ratajkowski\n\n*Welcome to Movie Central, SUBSCRIBE NOW!* - https://bit.ly/3mRDJox\n*MORE FREE MOVIES  on YouTube!* - \n🌟 Free Action Movies: https://bit.ly/3uMwRxq\n🌟 Free Sci-Fi Movies: https://bit.ly/3o3lLAm\n🌟 Free Horror Movies: https://bit.ly/3aBBt2J\n🌟 Free Asylum Movies: https://bit.ly/3cipzeI\n🌟 Free Crime/Thriller: https://bit.ly/3o01prJ\n🌟 Free Drama Movies: https://bit.ly/3Pu4mN9\n🌟 Free Comedy Movies: https://bit.ly/3IE0wPd\n🌟 Free Western Movies: https://bit.ly/3RqTX6u\n🌟 Free Adventure Movies: https://bit.ly/3yHolAT\n🌟 MOVIE CENTRAL Channel: https://bit.ly/3o27Fze\n\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
