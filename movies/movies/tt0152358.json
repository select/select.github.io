    "Plot": "This was fun. Krazy Kat is working in a night club. As he tries to play his piano, he is interrupted several times. The interrupters are some of the biggest box office comedians of the time: Joe E. Brown, the Marx Brothers, Laurel &amp; Hardy, Ben Turpin, and Jimmy Durante. Krazy must hold forth in the company of all these people. This is depression time and the band is playing \"Happy Days Are Here Again.\" This was the hopeful anthem of the time. Still, one couldn't help but be impressed by the joyfulness of this cartoon. There is some wonderful animation making the whole place seem to dance. One of the better Krazy offerings.",
