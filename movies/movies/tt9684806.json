    "Plot": "Three women who have been friends since childhood are enjoying their monthly dinner party when one announces to the other two, \"Together we make up the perfect woman -- you're the brains, you're the personality, and I'M the beauty!\" The others are devastated. How could she say such a thing? Six months later the three are each facing defining moments in their lives. One is struggling to be more than simply \"the beauty\" and failing miserably. Another faces a career change and extracurricular explorations. And the third faces a complete change in lifestyle as she prepares to have a baby -- alone. Trials ensue, but ultimately the three women are able to define themselves and their friendship beyond a one-dimensional view of beauty, brains, and personality. The three realize that though they may be just fine on their own, they are stronger, braver, and happier together.",
