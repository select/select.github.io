    "Plot": "A cartoonist draws a sketch of dachshund lying next to a bureau. Asking for an opinion, the cartoonist is told that the dog looks too stiff and has no sense of motion. Hearing these comments, the offended dachshund, after the cartoonist leaves the room, decides to show that the critique is wrong by moving around. The dachshund's main focus is getting the plate of sausages sitting atop the bureau, which he manages to get and eat. The question becomes will the cartoonist notice that something is different about his sketch when he returns?",
