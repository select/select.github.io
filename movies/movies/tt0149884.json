    "Plot": "Krazy Kat sings the statement: I am a bird man!\" several times, straps a plank to each hand and jumps off a roof. This is not going to turn out well.Of course, delusion had never been unknown in George Herriman's strip; whenever Ignatz Mouse heaved a brick at Krazy's head, she took it as a sign of affection. However, Harrison and Gould had been directing the Krazy Kat movie cartoons for ten years at this point and Krazy now was almost always a tom cat. So were Harrison &amp; Gould harking back to the comic strip, or had they simply come up with the final gag and built the entire cartoon around it? I haven't the slightest idea and found the cartoon fairly annoying, despite the numerous good gags scattered through it. This is a clear case of Your Mileage May Vary. I hope you enjoy watching this one.",
