    "Plot": "Cubby and Honey get into trouble with some pirates in this typically uninspiring Cubby Bear cartoon. It is slightly better than usual in its use of the sort of story which small children make up, with random elements added in as they go along; surely this must appeal to their intended audience. However, as I am not a small child, I am not particularly impressed.There is also something odd going on about the background work. Some one liked to draw and ink rocks. That is very clear. On the other hand, the other background work is of much lower detail and quality. Perhaps the supervisor said \"We're out of money. Ship it!\" or the time came for its release.",
