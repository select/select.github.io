      "description": "Black Sabbath is a 1963 horror anthology film directed by Mario Bava. The film consists of three separate tales that are introduced by Boris Karloff. The order in which the stories are presented varies among the different versions in which the film has been released. In the original, Italian print, the first story, titled \"The Telephone\", involves Rosy who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is \"The Wurdulak\", where a man named Gorca returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved.",
