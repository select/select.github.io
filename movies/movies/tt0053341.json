      "description": "Six former German soldiers, each with a very different character, accept an offer from the British occupation forces to work as a bomb disposal squad in Berlin after the end of the war. Half their salary is to be given to the last survivor. A carefully and thrillingly staged adventure film, impressive in its portrayal of a \" fatefully \" assembled group of men unable to escape their suicidal job.",

    "Plot": "At the end of the Second World War six German ex-soldiers return to Berlin and set up as a bomb disposal group. The pressure of the dangerous work starts to affect them, the more so as they have agreed to pool half their pay so that if only one survives he takes it all. Casualties and friction are inevitable, and having to handle British 1000lb bombs seems particularly bad news.",
