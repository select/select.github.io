      "description": "This crime drama about a playboy lawyer trying to make good as an assistant DA should be used in film schools as a textbook example of how not to direct and edit a feature film. Don’t blame the cast members. Their task was hopeless. The IMDB 5.4 rating is extremely generous. Directed by Vin Moore. Released in 1936.   2 minutes are missing.   ",
