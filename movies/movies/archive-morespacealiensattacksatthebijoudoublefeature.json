      "description": "There’s a crisis at the border! Those damn undocumented space aliens just keep coming and coming! Where will it all end? The evening of alien terror begins with previews of coming catastrophes. Then in “Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster” aliens invade Puerto Rico to shrink-wrap beach babes. Why? Because they can. Next in “Invisible Invaders” John Agar uses loud noises to fight John Carradine and his army of killer zombies, which I believe was the inspiration for heavy metal.",
