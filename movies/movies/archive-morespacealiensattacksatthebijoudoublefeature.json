      "description": "There’s a crisis at the border! Those damn undocumented space aliens just keep coming and coming! Where will it all end?

Next in “Invisible Invaders” John Agar uses loud noises to fight John Carradine and his army of killer zombies, which I believe was the inspiration for heavy metal.",
