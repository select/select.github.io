      "description": "It's Friday@PizzaFLIX \nStars: Neil Hamilton, Evelyn Brent, Doris Hill\nDirector: Louis J. Gasnier\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHgXUJMN1TXEBMtSqYpWfok-xg95KXao\nBefore he shocked the nation with Reefer Madness, director Louis J. Gasnier took a walk on the Supernatural side with this rare gem from Paramount Pictures.\n\nYou may know him as Commissioner Gordon, but Neil Hamilton’s career didn’t begin on the small screen with Batman ‘66. In this pre-code mystery, he delivers a compelling turn as a boardwalk photographer caught in a web of spiritualistic fraud and deception. With the haunting Evelyn Brent at his side as a phony clairvoyant, it’s an atmospheric tale where con men, say-ances, and lost souls  \ncollide. Doris Hill and David Newell round out the cast with memorable roles that add depth and intrigue. \n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?
