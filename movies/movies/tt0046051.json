      "description": "In 1505, Martin Luther (Niall MacGinnis) abandons his law studies to become a monk. After being ordained a priest, Luther grows increasingly troubled by the Catholic Church's practices, including using Latin during services and offering absolution -- known as \"indulgences\" -- for sinners. In 1517, P ope Leo X (Philip Leaver) tries to bring the church much-needed money by selling indulgences. Outraged, Luther writes down his famous 95 Theses, publicly challenging church dogma.",

    "Plot": "This biographical account of Martin Luther's actions that eventually created the Lutheran and Protestant denominations was filmed in conjunction with the Lutheran Church. Niall MacGinnis portrays the friar whose nailing of the ninety-five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg created such a stir that it shook the foundations of the medieval Church. This movie shows the struggle between Luther and Rome, and how the medieval Church did not fully explain things he questioned, which led to him to be labelled a heretic.",
