      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This experimental French film shows both surrealist and expressionist traits, and helped to lay the foundations for what would become French Surrealism in film. It is about a priest who has hallucinations due to his extreme lust of a woman. I have included five existing soundtracks and a subtitle track, though the only title card is at the very start of the film. ",
