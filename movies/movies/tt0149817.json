    "Plot": "When Old Mother Hubbard goes to the cupboard to fetch her old dog Jack a bone, all she finds is a bean, which Jack plants in this good Terrytoons Halloween cartoon.There were many Halloween cartoons produced in the 1930s to scare and entertain the kids. The tradition fell out of favor by the late 1940s, but this one plays nicely with the images. The giant's castle is filled with bats, skeletons (drawn in a barebones fashion) and ghosts which transform into various musical instruments which play Cab Calloway-style music. The giant, close up, is only seen from the legs down, to indicate his size nicely.Although the modern viewer may be put off a bit by the lack of color photography in this one, director Nolan's handling of the subject should is an interestingly spooky variation of the often-used subject.",
