      "description": "1920 directed by Tod Browning produced by Carl Laemmle starring Priscilla Dean, Lon Chaney, Wheeler Oakman, Ralph Lewis, E.A. Warren and Stanley Goethals. Chaney plays dual roles in this crime drama set in San Fransico’s Chinatown: as the vicious and seedy “Black” Mike Silva and the subservient and goodly Ah Wing. The second collaboration between Browning and Chaney, the film is considered to be one of the first psychologically driven films of the gangster genre. The film features some terrific fight scenes. The soundtrack is composed of “#163: In Their Terror Capable of Anything, Part 2” by Bull of Heaven, with added sound effects.  ",
