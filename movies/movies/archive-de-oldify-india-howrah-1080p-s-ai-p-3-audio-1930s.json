      "description": "In this film we take another great time travel trip back to India. It is not easy to determine when this film was made considering that so much in India remained largely unchanged around the middel of the 20th century. To judge by the scarce number of cars and buses that appear in this film, it was probably shot in the second half of the 1930s. The film revolves around the town of Howrah, which is the second-largest city after Kolkata located in the Indian state of West Bengal. To be more precise, Howrah is located on the western bank of the Hooghly River opposite its twin city of Kolkata. Great views of this river appear in the beginning and a number of times later on in this film. We see splended shots of daily life in Howrah consisting of children playing in the river, elephants at work as well as dressed up in parades, ox and horse drawn carts and buggies, a man vigorously spraying water on the road, presumably to keep down the dust, market scenes and many skilled craftsmen at work, goats, sacred cows and other cattle being driven through the very busy streets and much more. Police men struggle to keep some order among the many pedestrians, cattle, carts with goods motorcars and buses. A particularly interesting scene in the middle of the film shows a traditional elephant fight. Two mahouts force their elephants to fight across a stone wall for the amusement of hundreds of spectators. These are images of Indian tradition that goes back in time for many centuries. Such fights apparently take place once a year in particular in the North of India to mark the local harvest festival. Normally these fights take place in a circle; making the elephant fight over a wall seems to be more rare. On average such spectacles last about 20 minutes. The film ends with extremely busy traffic on a long wooden bridge accross the river Hooghly. Just to finish by commenting that, in addition to our regular 4-stage restoration process, we used a new piece of Artificial Intelligence software that reconstructs faces, people, animals, building and all other objects in film footage. We hope you agree that the results are truly remarkable! Music: Taomita",
