      "description": "Notorious counterfeiter \"100 Dollar Bill\" Bailey (Willard Robertson) has eluded police capture for fifteen years while passing off his signature C-notes. He brazenly passes himself off as Secret Service agent Charles Gilbert to Detective Steve McBride (Barton MacLane) and Captain McTavish, and recruits police help in what they think will be a sting operation at the local racetrack to catch Bailey. Actually, Bailey/Gilbert uses the opportunity to exchange his phony bills for the real thing right under Steve's nose. But McBride's fiancee (Glenda Farrell), a reporter who gets help from Officer Gahagan (Tom Kennedy) on his day off and a German shepherd named Blitzen, is able to penetrate the counterfeiting ring. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
