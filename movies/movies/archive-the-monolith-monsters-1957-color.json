      "description": "When a strange black meteor crashes near the sleepy desert town of San Angelo, it litters the countryside with rock fragments. When a storm exposes these fragments to water, they grow into skyscraper-sized monoliths, which then topple and shatter into thousands of pieces that then grow into new monoliths. Any humans in the way are crushed or turned into human statues. The citizens (Grant Williams, Lola Albright, Les Tremayne, Trevor Bardette) desperately try to save themselves and the world from the spreading doom. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
