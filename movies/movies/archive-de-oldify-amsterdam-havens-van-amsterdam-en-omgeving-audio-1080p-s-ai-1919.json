      "description": "Highly interesting views of Amsterdam's bustling harbor over a century ago. In 1919 Amsterdam still had open access to the sea via the Zuiderzee. After the Afsluitdijk was constructed and opened on 23 september 1933 Amsterdam lost its connection with the Northsea via the Zuiderzee which became a lake called the IJsselmeer. Fortunately its harbor was still in direct connection with the North Sea via the 21 km long Noordzee Kanaal which was dug in the 19th century and opened in 1896. Till this day all ships have to pass the huge sea locks at IJmuiden. For more details see the timeline below. The original B&W video has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced, restored and colorized by means of modern A.I. video software.
