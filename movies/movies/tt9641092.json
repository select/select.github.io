      "description": "Bethany Shanholtz, a beautiful young government operative, moves back to her rural Virginia hometown to get away from the spy life. But townspeople start getting murdered and her government bosses convince her to investigate, unofficially. She's not allowed to use agency resources so she calls upon friends from her childhood as a home-schooled farm girl. The investigation quickly leads to Bethany's ex-boyfriend Jamie and the mystery surrounding his sister's mysterious death many years ago. The closer Bethany gets to the answers, the more the murders seem to be related to her own past - and the town's future.\n2018.
