      "description": "This film shows stunning views of New York's Waterfront as seen from a boat on the Hudson River. During this trip we pass Battery Park, Clinton Castle (with its roof still intact), Battery Park, the Staten Island Ferry, Various 'slips', the IWW building and the New York State Canal Building. Clinton Castle was the home of the New York Aquarium until 1941. In the years to follow, the city council made no less than six attempts to get this castle demolished. Battery park where the Dutch made their first settlement \"Nieuw Amsterdam\" under the lead of Peter Stuijvesant. The city was renamed \"New York\" under later British rule. The original film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, A.I enhanced and A.I. colourized by means of modern video software. Source B&W footage: Prelinger Archive (USA). Music: Hampus Naeselius - \"Adapted by Dark\".
