Hercules (Reg Park) is part of the crew, but the strongman falls overboard in a thick fog. Washed ashore, he saves a young girl, Ismene (Laura Altan), from a shape-shifting creature. She ta kes Hercules to Atlantis, where he discovers that her mother, the evil Queen Antinea (Fay Spain), has captured Androcles. Hercules schemes to rescue him and thwart Antinea's dream of world conquest.",
