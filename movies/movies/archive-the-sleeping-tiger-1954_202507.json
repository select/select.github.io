      "description": "he Sleeping Tiger is a 1954 British film noir directed by Joseph Losey and starring Alexis Smith, Dirk Bogarde and Alexander Knox. It was Losey's first British feature, which he directed under the pseudonym of Victor Hanbury due to being blacklisted in the McCarthy Era. It was shot at Walton Studios and on location in London. The film's sets were designed by the art director John Stoll. It was released by Anglo-Amalgamated while in America it was distributed by Astor Pictures.  Plot: When brash young thug Frank Clemmons (Dirk Bogarde) attempts to rob psychiatrist Clive Esmond (Alexander Knox), the doctor surprisingly gains the upper hand. Instead of sending Frank to jail, Clive offers to have the criminal stay at his home, where he'll attempt to reform the delinquent via in-depth analysis. Settling into the doctor's house, Clive meets Esmond's wife, Glenda (Alexis Smith), who initially dislikes her coarse guest. When Glenda begins to fall for Frank, intense conflict ensues.",
