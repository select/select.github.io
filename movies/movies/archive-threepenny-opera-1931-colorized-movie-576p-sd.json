      "description": "The Threepenny Opera ( German : Die 3 Groschen-Oper) is a 1931 German  musical film  directed by  G. W. Pabst . Produced by  Seymour Nebenzal 's  Nero-Film  for  Tonbild-Syndikat AG  ( Tobis ), Berlin and  Warner Bros. Pictures GmbH , Berlin, the film is loosely based on the 1928  musical theatre  success  of the same name  by  Bertolt Brecht  and  Kurt Weill . As was usual in the early  sound film  era, Pabst also directed a  French-language  version of the film, L'Opéra de quat'sous, with some variation of plot details (the French title literally translates as \"the fourpenny opera\"). A planned English version went unproduced. The two existing versions were released on home video by  The Criterion Collection . The Threepenny Opera differs in significant respects from the play and the internal timeline is somewhat vague. The whole of society is presented as corrupt in one form or another. Only some of the songs from the play are used, in a different order.",
