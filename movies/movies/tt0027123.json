    "Plot": "The Skipper's morning trolley run is disrupted by several forces; first, a steep hill where all his passengers get out to help push and are left behind. Next, Molly Moo-Cow chases after the trolley and climbs on; her weight sends it into a muddy lake. The Skipper calls for Katrinka (her motto: \"I fix.\") who pulls him and the car out of the mud. The car is too filthy, even after a quick wash, so Katrinka repaints it in red thanks to a handy paint shed. This incites a bull, so after the Skipper's bullfighting skills prove inadequate, another call to Katrinka. She flings the bull, then the Skipper. He finally gets to the train station, only to discover the train's been cancelled until next week.",
