      "description": "Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules , originally known as  Anthar l'invincibile  ( Anthar the Invincible ) and  Soraya Reina Del Desierto  (  Soraya, Queen of the Desert ) is a 1964 Italian/French/Spanish  international co-production  filmed in Algeria and directed by  Antonio Margheriti . This version, while not in its original 2:35 Techniscope aspect ratio, is at least widescreen and has somewhat improved color quality over the commonly available faded and scratched 16mm print found all over the internet. I've come to enjoy Kirk Morris. He's certainly no worse than other peplum stars, and brings a robust and youthful charisma to the proceedings.",
