      "description": "From IMDB : A detective investigating the death of a heroin-addicted prostitute uncovers evidence pointing to the existence of a murderous devil cult. This MPEG2 was ripped from Mill Creek's Gore and More 10 Movie box set, this version is sort of widescreen (letterboxed) but it was apparently cropped on both sides to make it a more matted widescreen (why?) I just wanted to let you know that I didn't do this, it was probably whoever was in charge of releasing this film on home media originally. The AVI provided has the black spaced cropped off and it is deinterlaced.",

    "Plot": "Montréal Police Detective Sergeant Jim Henderson is the lead investigator into the death of a scantily-clad young woman found outside an apartment building, the initial belief being that she was pushed from the unoccupied twentieth floor penthouse balcony. Henderson's partner, Detective Sergeant Pierre Paquette, recognizes her as a prostitute, who they eventually will learn has the working name Elizabeth Lucy, a junkie and one of Meg Latimer's girls. In questioning Meg and another one of her girls, Laura, Henderson and Paquette will also learn that Elizabeth was a non-practicing Catholic, much like Henderson himself, despite the fact that a crucifix on a chain was around her neck and pyx tightly clutched in her hand when she was discovered. The story of Henderson and Paquette investigating the murder, which gets them and their associates into mortal danger the further they get into the investigation, is interwoven with the story of how Elizabeth ended up dead outside that apartment building. If Henderson and Paquette are able to discover the truth, Henderson may further question his own already tenuous Catholic faith.",
