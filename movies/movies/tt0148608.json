    "Plot": "All the ghosts in the graveyard go out to scare people -- all except Casper, who sits quietly at his tombstone reading \"Poems of Friendship.\" An ectoplasmic drill sergeant commands him to join the others. Instead, Casper goes out to find a friend. He only frightens Mr. Bull, who goes tearing down the railroad tracks like a train. Meanwhile, the Three Pigs -- Ma, Pa and Junior -- are enjoying domestic life. Junior goes fishing, as Pa warns him to \"watch out for that wicked old wolf.\" Instead, Junior meets Casper, and the two become fast friends. They enjoy fishing together, but the friendship is nearly as dead as Casper when the parents meet him. Happily, an encounter with the Wolf changes their minds.",
