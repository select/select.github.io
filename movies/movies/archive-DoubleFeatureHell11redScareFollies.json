      "description": "The 2am Theater takes us back to those wonderful days of yesteryear when folks were digging bomb shelters in their back yards, \"duck & cover\" was all the rage and Joe McCarthy and friends were screaming the reds are taking over the US from within. Enjoy. (Don't be surprised if you are reminded of the current presidential campaign.) Our night of thrilling terror begins with the trailer for \"Panic in Year Zero,\" which tells us all we need to survive the coming nuclear holocaust is a camper-trailer and a few guns, but then the raping begins. The first feature presentation is \"Invasion USA,\" in which Commies from within and the Russians from without totally crush the US in a matter of days, and then the raping begins. The intermission short is \"Red Nightmare,\" in which the failure to attend PTA meetings leads to a Commie takeover. (sorry no raping) It's followed by that jaw-dropping bit of exploitation schlock produced in Hazlet, New Jersey, \"Rocket Attack USA.\" Sputnik and an absurd espionage mission bring on the nuking of New York City. At the end you may be forgiven for thinking someone should have nuked Hazlet, New Jersey. (Special thanks to content-contributing member Freddie Jaye for making \"Rocket Attack USA\" available.)",
