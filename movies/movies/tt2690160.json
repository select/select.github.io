Now, Slate has to team up with diver, Henry, happy holidaymakers, Rod and Jane, and the marine biologist, Sarah Jones, to retrieve a Mayan treasure from the dangerous waters; however, the scaly beast from the sea is ever-present and famished. But, what good is a chest full of gold when you're dead? Can Jackson and his team defeat the all-powerful reptile, Poseidon Rex?",
