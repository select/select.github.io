      "description": "Original Dutch title: \"Onze Vloot\", a Dutch navy film from 1923. The film is 'gold' for naval enthusiasts! Extremely rare footage of early types of submarines and a torpedo gun boat G-13 in action in The Netherlands almost a century ago. The film shows the gun boat being prepared to go on an exersize to test a new type of torpedo. The film also shows very rare shots of very old Dutch naval vessels in the harbor of Den Helder, including a gun boat, an armoured ship: the Hr.Ms. Heemskerck (1908), an armoured cruiser: the Hr.Ms. Gelderlander (1900) and the ancient Hr.Ms. Koningin Emma (1879) with its three masts still partly intact. The latter ship was used as a \"wachtschip\", i.e. a floating barracks, until WW-II. In part-1 of this series from 1928 this ship can be seen with it masts removed. There after we see the Hr.Ms. Medusa (1911). After completing the torpedo test the crew of the gun boat has a hard time to retrieve the still smoking torpedo and to hoist it back on board. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, contrast- and brightness enhanced, de-noised and A.I. upscaled and colorized.
