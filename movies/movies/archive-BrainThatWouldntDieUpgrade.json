      "description": "Yet another version of this sci-fi/horror \"classic.\" After being decapitated in a car crash, \"Jan in the Pan\" needs a new body, and deranged surgeon/fiancee Herb Evers begins stalking strippers with the hope of performing a full-body transplant and eventually getting the best of both worlds. Naturally, things do not go quite as planned. I believe this is a clearer/sharper transfer of \"Brain\" than many (most?) of the others available in the Archive. Run time is 82 minutes, so all of the shocking gore (dismemberment, neck chewing) is intact.",
