Then the operation starts, and after handing over instruments at an ever-increasing pace, Daffy loses it and is ejected. He gets his head stuck in an iron lung, and feels the effects for a while. Daffy goes in search of a patient of his own, and Porky happens to walk by in time to fall victim to Daffy's mallet. Daffy hits himself on the head and has a consultation with the second and third image of himself. They agree to operate; Daffy chases Porky, and they both get stuck in the iron lung.",
