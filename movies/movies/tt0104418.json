      "description": "“Not surprisingly it’s crap” (IMDB review quote). Highway hookers in laughably awful early-forties exploitation. A low-budget anti-classic with a cast of acting class washouts that will make you long for an Ed Wood movie -- any Ed Wood movie! Don’t say you weren’t warned. IMDB rating 4.4. Produced and Directed by Patrick Carlyle. Released in 1941 Complete print (unfortunately) AKA “Hitchhike to Hell” “Going My Way, Mister?” “Highway Girls”",
