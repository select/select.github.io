      "description": "The town of Sleepy Hollow received a new teacher, Ichabod Crane (Will Rogers), from New York. Crane already knows of the legend of the phantom Headless Horseman and is sceptical about its truth. His teacing methods are harsh and he no sooner rubs the villagers the wrong way when he begins to see the famous apparition.
