      "description": "Paul Newman as a taciturn outsider. A gripping Western by Martin Ritt.. Paul Newman plays the white man John Russell, raised among the Apaches and thus familiar with their way of thinking and acting. Together with a group of travelers who view the outsider with contempt, Russell becomes embroiled in a stagecoach robbery in which the bandits are after the embezzled money of an Indian agent. Without food or sufficient water, the bandits abandon the group in the wilderness except for one hostage. The motley crew must reluctantly entrust themselves to the leadership of the experienced Russell, increasingly irritated by his behavior and Indian philosophy of life.   An unsentimental film, superbly photographed by James Wong Howe , in which the dialogue and the inner tension of the characters take center stage and which features Paul Newman in an exceptional role.",
