      "description": "This second simulated wartime double feature program at an American movie theater is about World War 2 on the Canadian and British home fronts.   The action begins with coming attractions, a newsreel clip and a cartoon. The first feature presentation is the Powell and Pressburger masterpiece “49th Parallel” which traces the flight of violent Nazi fugitives across the Canada. The intermission featurette is the Disney animated short “Education for Death” (see note). Then it’s British village folk versus an insidious Nazi plot in the suspenseful espionage thriller “Cottage to Let.” Both feature presentations come equipped with superb casts and good to excellent production values.   NOTE: The wartime shortage of color film stock sometimes meant that films which were produced in Technicolor had to be exhibited with black and white film stock.",
