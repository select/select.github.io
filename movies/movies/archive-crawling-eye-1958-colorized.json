      "description": "A UN scientist (Forrest Tucker) is invited to a remote observatory in the Swiss Alps to investigate a strange radioactive cloud. He encounters a young woman with psychic powers (Janet Munro) who has visions of grisly murders apparently committed by creatures living in the cloud. With Jennifer Jayne, Laurence Payne, Warren Mitchell. Screenplay by Jimmy Sangster. Original title: The Trollenberg Terror I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
