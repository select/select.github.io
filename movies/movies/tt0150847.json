    "Plot": "All the insects of celebrating getting in the crops, making wine and so forth. Even the troubadour grasshopper is welcome. However, when the spider interrupts the celebration, who will save the butterfly from his clutches? Paul Terry's background artists seem to have solved their issues with Technicolor in the middle of this cartoon. While some of the backgrounds are still a confusing murk painted over a detailed black-and-white skeleton, several of them are quite lovely, impressionist drawings with a white background. Terry would learn the lesson erratically -- when budget permitted they would still go for the overly detailed and confusing candy box look -- but there are moments of beauty as well as humor. Some of the gags are quite funny and some are sophisticated -- the butterfly's dance looks like early Edison actualities.When it comes down to it, however, this is the same cartoon Terry had been producing at least since 1930: happy insects, vile spider -- drawn the same way except for the color -- who kidnaps the beautiful feminine insect, who is then rescued by the unlikely hero. Wait a couple of years, then redo it with with more advanced technique.",
