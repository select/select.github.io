      "description": "After an amateur stargazer (Richard Carlson) and a schoolteacher (Barbara Rush) see a meteorite crash in the Arizona desert, they suspect an alien presence when some of the local townsfolk (Joe Sawyer, Russell Johnson) begin to act strangely. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. It's been sped up slightly, so the running time is shorter than the official 81 minutes, but no scenes were left out.",
