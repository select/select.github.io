      "description": "This simulated wartime double feature program at an American movie theater in the early ‘40s is a tribute, typical of the time, to our gallant British Allies. The road to ultimate victory begins with coming attractions, a Movietone newsreel and a cartoon. The feature presentations are two critically acclaimed dramas of the Royal Navy’s war at sea, “In Which We Serve” and “We Dive at Dawn.” The intermission short subject is the USAAF recruiting film “Winning Your Wings.” ",
