      "description": "Oddball little movie with an almost dreamlike quality. Sweet tale of a young farmer who travels to the city with his dog to try to market his cheeses, and meets a burlesque dancer who asks him to pretend to be her husband. Many quirky random scenes occur as we follow his story and that of his dog who wanders off. Stars Ben Alexander who later starred in 50s TV series Dragnet as Joe Friday's sidekick Frank Smith, and Jeanette Loff. Colorized using DeOldify and custom filters.
