      "description": "“Surprise package” “Unsuccessful” “Amusing B-feature” “Interesting idea -- dull execution” (IMDB reviews quotes). An uneven British farce that has its moments, but the script often lets down the cast. Edward Rigby and Henry Mollison costar. Adequate production values. Watching it won’t kill you, but there are better ways to spend 60 minutes. IMDB rating 5.5. Directed by Godfrey Grayson. Released in 1950 (UK). Complete print. CAST NOTE: Peter Burton’s feature film debut.",
