      "description": "AKA Vessel of Wrath. If you enjoy Somerset Maugham stories, then you will enjoy this near-perfect, delightful film adaptation. The characters catch the essence of Maugham, and both Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester (husband and wife team) breath life into two very opposite sorts of people who discover--through adversity--that they have more in common than they dreamed possible",
