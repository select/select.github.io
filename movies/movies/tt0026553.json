She arrives at work as a court stenographer, stewing about her experiences with impolite people. Frustrated by her treatment, Betty dresses up in a judge robe and sings about what she would do if she were judge for a day. She is a behavior judge who passes judgment on \"public pests\" putting them on display. She calls out those who \"blow smoke at you and thinks it's great,\" he who \"slaps your back and shakes your spine,\" he \"who always parks his chewing gum,\" and more. In each example, the offender gets treated to a taste of their own bad behavior. In the end, Betty is lauded for her punishment of the rude, unsociable conduct by a crowd of adoring fans.",
