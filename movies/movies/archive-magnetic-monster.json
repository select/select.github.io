      "description": "Dr. Jeffrey Stewart (Richard Carlson) and Dr. Dan Forbes (King Donovan) of the Office of Scientific Investigation are called in when a strong magnetic field appears to have magnetized every metal item in a local hardware store. They eventually trace the source of the magnetism to a new radioactive element that absorbs energy from metallic objects surrounding it and whose uncontrolled growth seems unstoppable. Also starring Jean Byron. This is the first of 3 movies by Ivan Tors about the Office of Scientific Investigation, the others being Riders to the Stars (1954) and Gog (1954), both of which were made in color. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
