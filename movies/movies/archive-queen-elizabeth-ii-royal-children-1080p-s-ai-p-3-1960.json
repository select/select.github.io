      "description": "With great sadness the world learned of the death of her majesty Queen Elizabeth II yesterday afternoon. In her memory we bring you three restored, enhance and colorized films. This is the second film which was made in 1961 and has the title \"Royal Children\". It shows splended scenes of her majesty's life and family in the early years of her reign (between 1952 and 1960). There are great shots of Prince Charles, Prinses Anne and baby Prince Andrew. Prince Edward was not yet born. We bring this enhanced and colorized film for historic reasons only. It is not being monetized or exploited in any other way. May Queen Elizabeth II, who has been part of my life since I was born, rest in peace. \"Thank you for everything\". This film has been restored, enhanced and colorized with the latest Artificial Intelligence video software. It still is not flawless, but has most certainly significantly improved the quality of the original B&W footage.",
