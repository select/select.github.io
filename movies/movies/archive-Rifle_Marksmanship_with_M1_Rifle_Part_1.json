      "description": "These are Excellent videos for those who would like to know more about rifle shooting. They are great for both the beginner and the expert who needs a refresher. The series focuses on the M1 garand, but the techniques can be applied to any rifle. part one covers sling usage and shooting positions. Part 2 covers sight adjustments and also has one of the BEST explanations of windage adjustments EVER. The film was made in 1942/43 for the war department and is now in the public domain, so it can be copied and recopied at will. Please give a copy to anyone you may think would be interested in becoming a better shooter then visit www.rwva.org to find out about an APPLESEED shoot. Special thanks to Jack A Sol of the Revolutionary War Veterans Association for making these videos available to the general public.",
