    "Plot": "Before becoming famous after creating his own studio with Universal, Walter Lantz made a series for Bray Films starring Dinky Doodle--a live silent comedian who interacted with cartoons in way similar to the much later style of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\".Dinkie goes hunting but mostly he just gets himself in trouble. By the end, he's about to get eaten by a bear when his two young animated friends come to his rescue.This is a very entertaining cartoon for 1925. The interaction between the real and animated is nicely done--quite clever and, more importantly, rather funny. In many ways this is more entertaining than many of Lantz' later and more glossy projects. Well done--surprisingly so for such an early film.",
