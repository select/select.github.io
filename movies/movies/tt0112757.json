        "Charlie Chaplin's 60th Film Released April 16 1917 The Cure is a short comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin plays a drunk who checks into a health spa to dry out, but his suitcase full of alcohol does not aid him in this pursuit. Along the way he aggravates a large man and seduces a young lady, as Chaplin's characters are often wont to do. The film featured Chaplin's frequent co-stars Edna Purviance, Eric Campbell, Henry Bergman, John Rand, James T. Kelley, Albert Austin, and Frank J. Coleman. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007832/",
