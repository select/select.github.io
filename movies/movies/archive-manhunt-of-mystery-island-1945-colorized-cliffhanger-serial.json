      "description": "The creator (Forrest Taylor) of a scientific device is kidnapped, and his daughter (Linda Stirling) enlists the help of a private detective (Richard Bailey) whose investigations lead them to a remote Pacific island where they confront the four descendants of a long-dead pirate (Roy Barcroft) who has seemingly traveled forward in time. 15-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. For questions or general comments, please use the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum",
