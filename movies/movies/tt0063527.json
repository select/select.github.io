      "description": "Two years after his worldwide hit  Closely Watched Trains,  Jiří Menzel directed this amusing idyll about three middle-aged men whose mellow summer is interrupted by the arrival of a circus performer and his beautiful assistant. A meditation on aging and sex, shot in warm, sun-dappled color,  Capricious Summer  is one of the New Wave’s loveliest reveries.",

But now the major and even the canon sense Anna's attractiveness...",
