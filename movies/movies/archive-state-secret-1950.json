      "description": "A famed American surgeon is decoyed to a middle European country to perform a life-saving operation on its dictator. When the leader dies anyway, he is replaced by a look-alike and the doctor is pursued by the secret police so that he can never reveal his knowledge of the dictator's death. He seeks help from an English-speaking actress and both of them are then forced to flee. AKA \"The Great Manhunt\" Based on Roy Huggins' novel \"Appointment with Fear\" Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Dr. John Marlowe Glynis Johns as Lisa Robinson Jack Hawkins as Colonel Galcon Walter Rilla as General Niva Hans Moser as Sigrist Karel Stepanek as Dr. Revo Leonard Sachs as Dr. Poldoi Herbert Lom as Karl Theodor I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
