      "description": "“Brain dead” “Delightfully dippy” “Absence of logic” “Reeks of insipidness” (IMDB reviews quotes). The astonishing remake of the jaw-dropping “Cat-Women of the Moon” with juvenile dialog, juvenile delinquents, beauty contest winners and moon Gubmies (see note). The plot and dialog are more ridiculous than the original's. The sets are just as cheesy. The acting is much worse. An entertaining anti-masterpiece that’s bonanza for bad movie aficionados. In other words you gotta see it to believe it. IMDB rating 3.7. Directed by Richard Cunha. Released in 1958. Complete print. NOTE: Gumby was a claymation cartoon character from the early days of TV. TRIVIA: The last film shot at Screencraft Studios. SPECIAL NOTE: “Cat-Women of the Moon” is here: https://archive.org/details/Cat_Women_of_the_Moon  ",
