      "description": "AKA One Way Ticket to Hell Pert and pretty high school teen Cassandra Leigh (Barbara Marks) opts for the easy life of a pot-smoking biker in order to avoid the demands of her neurotic career mom (Lucille Price). When Cassandra's grades slip and her college plans fall by the wayside, she marries a love-smitten high school swain (Robert Norman). The devotion of her husband bores the young bride: she looks up her old thrill-seeking buddies and splits from home.",
