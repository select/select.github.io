    "Plot": "Paul Terry is co-credited on this one, a variation on the \"under the sea\" seas cartoons that he produced over the decades. In this one, a retired sailor explains the tattoo on his chest as a remembrance of his wife -- a blonde mermaid.After the Code was set up, Terry concentrated on cartoons for small children, so this is about as racy as he got. He offers us some nice detail work on the sailors' faces, but most of his gags are fairly standard for him: dog fish that look like Airedales, a villainous octopus that looks spidery: all tropes and images that his staffs had been using since the silent era. Nonetheless, the prologue and epilogue at a home for retired seamen, helps shape the story-telling very well.",
