    "Plot": "A man comes onto the stage through the fireplace, divides himself, and sits on stools on either side of a table. He places a woman's head on the table and a hat on her head. She speaks to both men, turning her head as she talks. One man crawls under the table to demonstrate that no body is hidden there. The second conjurer produces the rest of her and both men seek her affections. A Mephistophelian figure enters and dispatches the woman in to thin air. The first two conjurers leave, and the devil removes his disguise, bows, and exits.",
