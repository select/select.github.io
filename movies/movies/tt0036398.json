Morgan makes his headquarters at the Halfway House run by the parents of Maria Styx (Fifi D'Orsay) as a bar and dance resort catering to the planters and traders of the island. Taggert finds himself practically a prisoner along with a group of American girls acting as entertainers at the resort. Taggert shadows Morgan in his activities in a remote cove and finds that Morgan is supplying German U-boat commanders with torpedoes.",
