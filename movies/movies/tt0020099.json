Linda falls in love with Dr. Randall but remains with her husband until a scheming woman steps in and claims to be Decker's first and legal wife. Linda then goes to the city to live with her former schoolteacher and again meets Dr. Randall, but must leave him to return north and care for Decker, who has been hurt in a lumbering accident. Learning that the woman claiming to be Decker's wife is a fraud, Linda gallantly sticks with her husband until he finally dies from his injuries. Linda and the good doctor are then free to find happiness with each other.",
