      "description": "In the early 20th Century, fun-loving Pearl White (Betty Hutton), working in a garment sweatshop, gets her big chance to become an actress when she ends up \"opening\" for a delayed Shakespeare play with a comic vaudeville performance. Her brief stage career leads her into moving pictures, which she doesn't consider real acting. She comes to love the chaotic world of silent movies, becoming queen of the serials, but are the consequences of her movie stardom more than her leading man (John Lund) can take? With Billy De Wolfe. Directed by George Marshall",
