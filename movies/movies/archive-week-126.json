      "description": "Hell - low and welcome back to everyone's favorite Satan's sandbox.  With the Covid nonsense continuing, we thought some sort of alternate praying and worship may just be required, so we offer up group of Satanists with a witch thrown in to help lower the curve. First up, after the normal coming attractions and cartoon, we present 1961's \"The Devil's Hand\" about a group of \"Gamba\" Devil worshipers. Then, after a brief intermission, we finish up with \"Burn Witch Burn\" (aka \"Night of the Eagle\"), a 1962 offering about a wife who uses her bewitching charms to advance her husband's career. So, sit back and enjoy our ode to the darker arts and hopefully we can work our charms to make this Covid Crap go away. D on't forget w e also have an APP and a website.
