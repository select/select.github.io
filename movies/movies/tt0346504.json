      "description": "John Kennedy Jr. was American royalty and a cultural icon.  His promise of living out his political legacy bequeathed to him on the day of his father’s assassination, was cut short over the Atlantic Ocean one July night.  Kennedy’s death and that of his wife and sister-in-law, were the result of a series of bad decisions Kennedy had made during his last day.

When he becomes an Assistant D.A., the press is all over him, flunking one exam gets smeared all over the national press, wherever he goes people point at him, recognizing face and/or name, but hardly notice what he actually does. His mediatic mother Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis pushes him, stifles him, forbids him to become an actor or won't hear of him dating an actress, then dies herself.
