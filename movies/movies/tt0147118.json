    "Plot": "It must have been the sheer pressure of turning out a cartoon a week for Amadee van Beuren that made Paul Terry turn out this unusually absurd Farmer Alfalfa silent cartoon. It looks like his staff just kept throwing out gags and he said \"fine\". While some of the jokes don't quite work, like the ones presenting the dog as just like a boy in a dog suit, some are very funny indeed, like the hoity-toity cow and the villain who gets shot to pieces.Some people might call this \"surrealistic\", but all too often surrealism seems to be comedy produced for people with no sense of humor. There's plenty of good humor here.",
