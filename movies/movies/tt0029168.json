She declines, as she is in love with the pilot, Neil Bradshaw, and desires to learn to fly under his tuition. The airplane, because of unfavorable flying conditions, is grounded in L.A, but a passenger, movie star Diane Andre, insists that Neil start for New York, despite the weather. \"Spud\" Johnson, publicity director for the airline, sees publicity and exploitation possibilities and orders Neil to take up the airplane. Later, the plane is reported lost and the newspapers publish stories of the lost plane, the lost actress and the lost pilot. Then they are found on a mountain, having been forced down by the storm. While there, Diane offers to make Neil the leading man in her new film and he, forgetting his goal of flying solo around the world, accepts. Meanwhile, Joan, decides she will take some more flying lessons and do what he intended to do.",
