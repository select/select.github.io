      "description": "\"Put out that light!\" Gandy Goose and Sourpuss are Civil Defense air raid wardens on the home front during World War II. They come across a rooster and his family. The rooster fails to heed the media warnings to prepare in advance for blackout drills and scrambles to find suitable materials to make a blackout room in his house- with covered-up windows and no lights on- when the drill does come with hilarious results.

    "Plot": "Gandy Goose and Sour Puss are Air Raid Wardens, leading a parade with a a marching song. They are only incidental to this cartoon, however. It's about a rooster named Henry who has not obeyed World War II blackout regulations and the humiliating self-injuries he undergoes as a result of his dereliction in this Propaganda Terrytoon.It's not that this is a poorly made cartoon. The gags are consistent and well executed, and the uncredited voice work is quite good -- Henry sounds like a rooster. It's that this was clearly aimed at Terry's target audience of small children, who would doubtless go home and pester dad about fixing up the blackout curtains. I suppose any chance to make children more annoying was one worth taking.",
