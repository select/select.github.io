With nothing better to go on, the police follow up a report that the child was seen with a white stranger, and rumors run wild.

But Packard's troubles pale by comparison as ever more-inflated rumors uncap the well of racial tensions and mob violence. And young Carolyn Crawford, forgotten by most, is still missing.",
