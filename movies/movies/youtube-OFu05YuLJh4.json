      "description": "Failed Actor Hates His Life | Two Days | Paul Rudd | Satire Comedy Movie\n\nPaul Miller is a failed actor who has reached a point in his life where he no longer cares and has decided to commit suicide.  He gathers a rag tag documentary crew to film the last two days of his life.  His plan is to say goodbye to some friends and leave some sort of testament before kicking off.  However, the members of the film crew have their own ideas and reach out to people in Paul’s life, against his wishes, which changes the trajectory of the film and maybe his decision to kill himself.\n\n2003 Comedy Movie | Stars: Adam Scott, Karl Wiedergott, Mark Phinney, Paul Rudd\n*Licensed from Syndicado.
