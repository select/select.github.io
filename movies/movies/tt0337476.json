    "Plot": "Odd little 2-reeler from Nell Shipman Productions starring Shipman as a girl of the woods. She lives near an Idaho lumber camp where she skips along forest paths and communes with nature.One day she meets a sullen violinist and a hunchbacked boy dancing to the music and begging for coins. The older boy tells the story of how a tree he was chopping down fell on his brother and injured him so that he will never grow. Nell gets him a job in the lumber company office and tries to involve him with the villagers. No dice.The boy sees some lumberjacks rolling logs and tries to copy them, but he falls into the river and gets washed downstream toward the rapids. Nell sees this and canoes out to save him. But the canoe capsizes and the sullen boy must swim out to save them both.The \"happy\" ending is very odd.Good location shooting and stunts by the actors. The film has been nicely restored and has beautiful tints throughout.IMDb lists this films as 1926, but the film itself says 1924.",
