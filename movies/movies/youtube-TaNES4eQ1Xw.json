      "description": "Writer Alexei Bartenev receives information from the Red Cross about his relatives, from whom he was separated by the war. His father and mother died at the beginning of the war, and his older sister and two brothers were adopted by different people. Meeting them takes Bartenev back to the past. Memories of his childhood in an orphanage flash before him. These reflections on the past and confession to himself allow him to look into the soul of a hero who managed to overcome much and achieve much in life.\n\nIMDB: 7,6\n\nYear of production: 1976\n\nDirector: Nikolay Gubenko\nScriptwriter: Nikolay Gubenko\nCameraman: Alexander Knyazhinsky\nProduction designer: Alexander Tolkachev\n\nActors: Rolan Bykov, Georgy Burkov, Natalya Gundareva, Alexander Kalyagin, Juozas Budraitis, Alexey Cherstvov, Zhanna Bolotova, Nikolay Gubenko, Nikolay Volkov, Valentina Berezutskaya, Dmitry Bessonov, Evgeny Evstigneev, Bukhuti Zakariadze, Georgy Kavtaradze, Panteleimon Krymov, Daniil Netrebin, Victor Filippov, Mikhail Kherkheulidze, Lyudmila Shagalova",
