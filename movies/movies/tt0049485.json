    "Plot": "A gang of gunrunners is sought by both the Mexican Federales and the Yaqui Indians for different reasons - by the federal police to prevent the marauding tribes from preying on innocent farmers and by the Indians because the gunrunners' leader sold them bad medicine resulting in blindness for many of their children. The police capture the criminals, but both parties are surrounded in a ruined mission by the angry Indians. Can the cops and crooks work together to survive the onslaught of the tribesmen?",
