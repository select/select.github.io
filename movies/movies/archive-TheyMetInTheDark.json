      "description": "A wartime British espionage mystery costarring James Mason and Joyce Howard with a good supporting cast. It isn't film noir. So If you're looking for stark drama and gritty realism, look elsewhere. However if an entertaining mystery that doesn't take itself too seriously will suffice, you won't be disappointed. An adaptation of Anthony Gilbert's novel. Directed by Carl Lamac (as Karel Lamac). UK release 1943. US release 1945. Complete print",
