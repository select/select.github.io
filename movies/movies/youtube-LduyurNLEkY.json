Dowd is an amiable but eccentric man who insists his best friend is a Pooka -- in the form of an invisible six-foot white rabbit. Everyone thinks he’s nuts, but he may be wiser than anyone knows. A debacle ensues when Elwood's sister tries to commit him to a sanatorium.\n\nTRIVIA: Art Carney reprises the role that earned an Oscar nomination for James Stewart in the 1950 Big Screen adaptation directed by Henry Koster. Both versions are based on Mary Chase's 1944 play of the same name.",
