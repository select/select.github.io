      "description": "John Clark (Bob Steele) and his deaf pal, Bootch Collum (Buck Connors), are trailed by U. S. Marshal Lamar Bly (Jack Rockwell), who thinks they are part of The Kootney Kid's (Earl Dwire) gang, which had just held up the stage coach. But the gang attacks the pair, and Bly joins them in the gunfight. Bly is wounded and is taken to a Mexican's camp to recover. He gives John his badge and authorizes him to take up the hunt. The Kid, unknown to John by sight, is on a ranch which he hopes to gain legal possession of as it has oil. It is really John's by right, which he does not know until informed by his sweetheart, Joan Vallon (Roberta Gale.) The Kid has taken a letter from the stage holdup which he is using to establish his identity as the rightful owner named Everett Tarkington Clark, John's real name. John is in the courtroom when the Kid makes his claim, but his protest is overruled and he is arrested on suspicion of having killed Marshal Bly. He and Bootch escape and ride to intercept the Kid who is on his way to eliminate Bly, the only person that can verify John's claim",
