    "Plot": "Oswald is trying the hobo life, but an encounter with a copper takes the keenness out of his freedom. Life looks promising again when he meets Brother Bear hobo [Pete] who is boiling coffee over a campfire. Oswald donates an egg to the repast-which is promptly stolen. Suddenly they see a freshly-roasted chicken in a pantry window. Oswald is made to act as purloiner. His first attempt at theft is squashed by a ferocious bulldog. Finally a neat-but-not-flashy set of long willies on a line acts as end-man, and trolleys the bird to Ozzie. Foiled again (for a policeman happens on the scene), down the unfriendly road rushes our hero. Then the policeman seizes the fowl. The bulldog, spying this, chases the officer into the far horizon, much to Oswald's glee.",
