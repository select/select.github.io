      "description": "Code of the Mounted - Kermit Maynard A thug robs and kills a fur trapper. He is caught and locked up by the Mounties, but is soon broken out by his partner. As the Mounties investigate, they discover that the thug is part of a ruthless crime ring run by a female gangster. Kermit Maynard performs a lengthy exhibition of his trick riding abilities at the start of the movie. The great athlete Jim Thorpe is billed third - but is shot and killed in a very short scene lasting less then two minutes. He only had one line! Jim Thorpe was a poor actor but a great athlete. Jim Thorpe was voted the \"Greatest Athlete of the first Half Century (1900 - 1950)\". He was an All-American College Football Halfback, a star in Pro Football, won Gold Metals in both the Decathlon and Pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics, and played Pro Baseball for the New York Giants. ============================================================== Director: Sam Newfield Based on a Novel by: James Oliver Curwood Studio: Ambassador Pictures",
