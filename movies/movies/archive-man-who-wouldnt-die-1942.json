      "description": "When a dead body mysteriously disappears from its grave and an unknown assailant fires a shot at her, a woman hires a private detective to investigate, introducing him as her new husband. This is the last in a series of movies in which Lloyd Nolan portrayed private detective Michael Shayne, a character created by Brett Halliday, but the story is actually based on Clayton Rawson's novel \"No Coffin For The Corpse\". Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne Marjorie Weaver as Catherine Wolff Helene Reynolds as Anna Wolff Henry Wilcoxon as Dr. Haggard Richard Derr as Roger Blake Paul Harvey as Dudley Wolff Billy Bevan as Phillips - the Butler Olin Howland as Chief of Police Jonathan Meek Robert Emmett Keane as Alfred Dunning LeRoy Mason as Zorah Bey Jeff Corey as Coroner Tim Larsen I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
