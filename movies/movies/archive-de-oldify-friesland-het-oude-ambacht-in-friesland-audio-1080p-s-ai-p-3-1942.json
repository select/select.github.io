      "description": "Very interesting A.I. enhanced and colorized footage of the Dutch province of Friesland during WW-II, around 1942. Friesland lies in the north of the Netherlands. Its capital is Leeuwarden. The province is known for its many lakes that are connected by canals. Once in a while, during extremely cold winters, the famous \"Elf Stedentocht\", eleven cities scating competition is held along the canals and lakes.
