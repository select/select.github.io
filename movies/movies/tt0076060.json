Cardiff uses his skills to murder a prominent judge making his death look like an accident in order to plant an improvised explosive device at his funeral attended by the movers and shakers of the regime. Only one non conformist police captain is on to his plans. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/funeral-for-an-assassin-1974/",
