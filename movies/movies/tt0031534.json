Gangland overlord Frank Baturin is shot and only the intervention and operation by Mary Ling saves his life. She performs the operation because it is her duty as a doctor, but she also thinks Baturin was shot by her father following a quarrel with Baturin. The racketeer then sets out for vengeance against the man who had actually tried to kill him in order to take over the Chinatown rackets.",
