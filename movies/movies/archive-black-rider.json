      "description": "When a mysterious hooded figure on a motorbike appears in the English countryside near a ruined castle, a young reporter decides to invetigate. Jimmy Hanley as Jerry Marsh Rona Anderson as Mary Plack Leslie Dwyer as Robert Plack Lionel Jeffries as Martin Brenner Beatrice Varley as Mrs. Marsh Michael Golden as Rakoff Valerie Hanson as Karen Vincent Ball as Ted Lintott Edwin Richfield as Geoff Morgan I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
