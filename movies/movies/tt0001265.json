      "description": "In The Border States was directed by D.W. Griffith in 1910. Griffith was born in Kentucky in 1875 so as a youth he must have heard many tales of the Civil War. He went back to that war for many of his films including this one which tells an interesting little story of a young girl who saves he life of a Southern soldier and is later rewarded..",
