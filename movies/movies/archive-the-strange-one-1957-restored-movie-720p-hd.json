      "description": "The Strange One is a 1957 American film noir about students faced with an ethical dilemma in a military college in the Southern United States . It was directed by Jack Garfein , produced by Sam Spiegel , and was adapted from a novel and stage play by Calder Willingham called End as a Man . It marked the film debut of Ben Gazzara , George Peppard and Julie Wilson . Gazzara, Pat Hingle , Mark Richman and Arthur Storch reprised their roles, after starring in the stage version. The film is noteworthy, due to the entire acting and technical staff being from the Actors Studio . It focuses on the dehumanization associated with the tradition of hazing within the college and is noteworthy for its portrayal of homoerotic themes – and at least one gay character – at a time when the Hays Code prohibited such expression.",
