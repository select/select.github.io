      "description": "The SS \"Statendam\" was a cruise ship commissioned by the Holland-America Line (HAL) on 29 January 1919, built by the yard Harland & Wolff in Belfast, Ireland. In 1922 the further outfitting of the ship was suspended due to the steel crisis in England. In 1924 the yard decided to prepare the hull so that it could be launched on 11 September 1924. Subsequently, the hull was located on the finishing quay in Belfast until 1927 without any work being done on it. In 1927, the N.V. Maildienst der Holland Amerika Lijn decided to have the hull towed to the Netherlands, where Wilton Fijenoord was ordered to finish the ship. The first trial run of the hull can be seen in this film. On 20 April, while being towed by the tugs Roode Zee, Polarzee, Baltic Sea and Seine, the tow line broke at Hoek van Holland, causing the captain and 5 crew members to be injured. The hull arrived in Schiedam and Wilton completed the ship. On 4 April 1929 the ship was handed over to the HAL during the official sea trials. There were more than 300 guests on board, including HRH Prince Hendrik, seven ministers of the first Dutch cabinet De Geer and mayor Patijn of Rotterdam. Images of this can be seen in the film. On her maiden voyage, which took place on 11 April 1929, the Statendam III sailed to New York. Many more transatlantic crossings and other cruises followed in subsequent years. On 24 November 1939, the “Statendam\" started its last round trip to New York, after which it arrived in Rotterdam again on Boxing Day. The subsequent next departure on December 29 was canceled and the ship was laid up at the Wilhelminakade in Rotterdam. After the German invasion on 10 May 1940, the \"Statendam\", together with the \"Boschdijk\" and the \"Veendam\", was still located on the Wilhelminakade. The next day the Germans had occupied the Statendam and entrenched themselves with machine guns on the quarterdeck. Then there was a fierce firefight with Dutch soldiers in which the \"Statendam\" caught fire. This film shows scarce images of this fire. The \"Statendam\" was on fire for several days and was then a total loss. In August 1940 the burned-out hull was sold to the Frans Rijsdijk scrapyard in Hendrik Ido Ambacht. The original film fragments have been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, restored, enhanced and colorized by means of modern A.I. video software. Source: Beeld En Geluid. Music: Experia.",
