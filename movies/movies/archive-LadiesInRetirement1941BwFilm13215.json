      "description": "**PUBLIC DOMAIN** Ladies in Retirement (1941 B/W Film 1:32:15) (1941-09-18) Ladies in Retirement is an American 1941 film noir directed by Charles Vidor, and starring Ida Lupino and Louis Hayward. It is based on a 1940 Broadway play of the same title by Reginald Denham and Edward Percy which starred Flora Robson in the lead role. **PLOTLINE:: Ellen Creed, a proud spinster fallen on hard times, has been housekeeper/companion to her old friend Miss Leonora Fiske, a wealthy retiree who in her youth had been a chorus girl \"of easy virtue\", for about two years.One day when Ellen's away, a handsome young stranger called Albert Feather turns up, in need of money, and claiming to be Ellen's nephew. ** REVIEW: The New York Times reviewed the film favorably, \"For the film that opened yesterday at the Capitol is an exercise in slowly accumulating terror with all the psychological trappings of a Victorian thriller. It has been painstakingly done, beautifully photographed and tautly played, especially in its central role, and for the most part it catches all the script's nuances of horror quite as effectively as did the original play version ... Despite all its excellence, however, it must be added that Ladies in Retirement is a film for a proper and patient mood. It doesn't race through its story; it builds its terror step by step Academy Award nominations: 1) Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White: Lionel Banks & George Montgomery. 2) Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture: Morris Stoloff and Ernst Toch 23-year-old Ida Lupino played the 40-year-old sinister Ellen to ice cold perfection, with no small help from her make-up. Though stage-bound, this Gothic melodrama is well-crafted and involving\". 1969 REMAKE as ''The Mad Room'' SOURCE: Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_in_Retirement *** I OWN NO RIGHTS TO ANY PART OF THIS MOVIE.
