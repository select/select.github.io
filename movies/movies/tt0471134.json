    "Plot": "No matter how many times I look at them, whenever I return to the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon actualities, I feel profoundly affected. In part, I think, it is because these are real actualities. Most of what we think of as real events from the early history of cinema are anything but. They are staged or re-enacted, perhaps on the original site, but just as often in some studio or anonymous location. Even when we get a look at some one of note, of Theodore Roosevelt, it is usually at some public event, which was just as carefully staged a dozen decades ago as it is today.I don't get that feeling with the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon films, made while they wandered around Manchester and Northern England and Ireland. They set up their cameras carefully, and handled them well, and knew that their audience was the people they took pictures of, them and their relatives. That's why you see people staring at the camera. It's not that they don't know what it is. They're looking at it, seeing if they can see themselves. Well, they will.And they will be wearing a hat. Everyone in these films wears a hat.... well almost everyone. There must be easily a hundred and fifty people in this film, and there's one guy holding the ship's cat. He's not wearing a hat. And the pilot at the end of the movie takes off his hat to the camera. It feels like he's showing me respect. I hope I deserve it.",
