      "description": "Marshal Lash LaRue and his partner Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) are sent to a town to see if a respectable businessman (Ray Bennett) is actually leading the gang responsible for a series of robberies. Lash and Fuzzy join the gang, posing as the Dawson brothers, notorious outlaws from Texas. With Peggy Stewart. Written and directed by Ray Taylor I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
