A sharper print (\"21 DAYS TOGETER upgrade\") has been added.  “Superb suspense thriller” “Well played out story” “Well-worth watching” “Limp and unconvincing” “Disappointed” (IMDB reviews quotes). A romantic suspense thriller that failed to hit the mark, and thus its release was delayed for three years, that is until Olivier and Leigh were better known on both sides of the Atlantic. (see TRIVIA) Good supporting cast. IMDB rating 6.3. Directed by Basil Dean. Released in 1940 Complete print. TRIVIA: This was the second of three films Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier appeared in together. The other two were “Fire Over England” and “Lady Hamilton” (AKA “That Hamilton Woman”). A good print of “Fire Over England” is available here: https://archive.org/details/FireOverEnglandVideoQualityUpgrade  ",
