They soon find the castle is actually occupied by former actor, Travis Anderson, who initially is annoyed with these visitors until he recognises Edith, his ex-fiancèe amongst them. He decides to give them permission to use his castle, but warns them that the dungeons are off limits. Will they heed his warning?",
