The seemingly deserted castle looks perfect from the outside, so Rick and Daniel, accompanied by his secretary Edith, their photographer Dermott, and his five young models decide to break in. They soon find the castle is actually occupied by former actor, Travis Anderson, who initially is annoyed with these visitors until he recognises Edith, his ex-fiancèe amongst them. He decides to give them permission to use his castle, but warns them that the dungeons are off limits. Will they heed his warning?",
