      "description": "Alyas Batman en Robin (lit: \"Alias: Batman and Robin\") is a 1991 Filipino musical-comedy film produced by Regal Films spoofing the 1960s Batman television series. It stars comedian Joey de Leon as Batman, his son Keempee as Robin (the logo on his costume is actually the logo of Viva's rival film studio Regal Films instead of the robin logo) and Dawn Zulueta as Angelique Legarda. Several villains are also featured such as the Joker and the Penguin (here Tyo-p-a-enguin, literally \"Blowjob-guin\" in Spanglish, as well as a pun on \"Tiyo Paeng\"), respectively portrayed by comedians Rene Requiestas and Panchito Alba. The film was initially an unauthorized production, set to capitalize on the then in-production 1989 Batman film starring Michael Keaton. Warner Bros. threatened legal action and the release of the film was delayed until legal entanglements could be sorted out. The film was released in 1991, two years later than the intended 1989 release. A sequel was planned, launching Thursday group member and popular matinee teen idol and heartthrob Hector Chua. However, those plans did not materialize.",
