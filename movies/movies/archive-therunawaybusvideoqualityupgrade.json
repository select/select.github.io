      "description": "“Fun in the fog” “Frothy comedy” “A first class load of spooky fun” (IMDB reviews quotes). NOTE: This is the best print I’ve seen that also is in the correct aspect ratio. A classic comic mystery with lots of twists and turns mixed in with the laughs. Excellent British cast, good production values and definitely worth its 75 minutes. IMDB rating 6.3. Written and directed by Val Guest. Released in 1954. Complete print. CAST NOTE: The feature film debuts of Frankie Howerd, Belinda Lee and Michael Gwynn. TRIVIA: Frankie Howerd’s long telephone monologue was completely ad-libbed during the last hour of shooting, when it was discovered the film was too short to qualify as a main feature under British regulations.   ",
