      "description": "When an evil mastermind threatens to control the world with his death ray, a noted scientist and criminologist adopts a disguise as a masked figure in a black cloak, to go up against the villain, even though the police think it is him!  Loosely based on the pulp magazine and radio character, who is famous for being able to hide himself in the shadows, but this time is faced with a bad guy who can actually make himself invisible! 15 chapters Victor Jory as Lamont Cranston Veda Ann Borg as Margot Lane Roger Moore as Harry Vincent Robert Fiske as Stanford Marshall John Paul Jones as Mr. Turner Jack Ingram as Flint Chuck Hamilton as Roberts Edward Peil Sr. as Inspector Cardona Frank LaRue as Police Commissioner Ralph Weston Richard Cramer as the voice of The Black Tiger If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
