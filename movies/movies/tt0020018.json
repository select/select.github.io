      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Nominated for five Academy Awards, with lead actor Warner Baxter winning the Best Actor award, In Old Arizona was one of the earliest films to be fully voiced. It was also the first Western talkie picture as well as the first to record outdoors, as the recording equipment was quite bulky and cumbersome. Modern reviews are lukewarm, but it still may be worth viewing to see the early pioneering techniques used in the production. ",
