Aparently lacking not only cookery skills, but common sense as well, he salts and boils a can of beans in a saucepan on the stove. It explodes, leaving beans all splattered above. He mounts a stack of boxes and chairs to pick them off the ceiling one by one. Missus returns, and they have a screaming match, and now he leaves. Now out sitting (literally) in the dog house, he waits for her to cool down, but just then the stork has come calling, and their family is completed with a cradle full of hatching eggs.",
