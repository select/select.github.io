      "description": "Jonathan Pride (Charles Collins) is a dance teacher from Boston on his way to visit relatives in Los Angeles. His ship takes him around South America, where it's attacked by pirates. Pride is forced to work aboard their ship as a servant. He makes his escape when the ship docks on the California coa st, but he realizes the local mayor (Frank Morgan) and his daughter (Steffi Duna) think he's a pirate captain. Pride's attempts to explain who he really is only lead to more confusion.",
