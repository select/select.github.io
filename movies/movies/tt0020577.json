      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. A short romantic drama that follows a young officer who saves a woman and falls in love with her, before finding out that she is married to a superior officer. There isn't much from a modern standpoint to highlight about this film, besides that it was one of Richard Dix's early talking films. The preservation of this film is poor, and the only copy available that I could find has very low quality. ",
