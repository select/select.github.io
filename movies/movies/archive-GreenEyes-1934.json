      "description": "When a wealthy man is murdered at a costume party, each of the guests must be considered a suspect. Naturally, one of the guests is a mystery writer, and all of the other guests have what the police call \"motive.\" The premise wasn't as tired, back in 1934, when this was made. This copy has improved audio, compared to other copies I have found. I cleaned it up a little bit.",
