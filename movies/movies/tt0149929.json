    "Plot": "When Puddy the Pup goes to sleep after an evening of reading, he dreams of flying his bed like Little Nemo into a cloudscape where characters come out of their books in this charming Terrytoon.Although the cartoon soon loses its focus as Paul Revere appears to warn of an approaching giant, co-directors George Gordon and Mannie Davis create a cartoon that calls for color -- which studio boss Paul Terry is not yet ready to shell out for. This sort of cartoon, full of books that come to life, was done most frequently at Leon Schlesinger's studio. Terry's staff tried to impose a bit of a structure and plot on it. They are not entirely successful, but the result is engaging for its short length.",
