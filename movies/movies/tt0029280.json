      "description": "This British produced adventure at sea is a loose adaptation of Jack London's novel. It's an okay action yarn with a good cast. However for some its main attraction is the exterior footage shot aboard one of the last working four-masted windjammers. (see note) Filmed before in 1920 and in 1936 as \"Les Mutines de l'Elesneur.\" Directed by Roy Lockwood. UK release 1937. US release 1939. 9 minutes are missing. a.k.a. \"The Mutiny on the Elsinore\". TRIVIA: First telecast on 10/26/39 on NYC's experimental station W2XBS. NOTE: It is little remembered today that the World War 2 shipping shortage became so severe a few windjammers were placed in service as bulk carriers on less critical routes.
