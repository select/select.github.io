      "description": "It's FRIDAY @PizzaFLIX \nStars: Arlene Martel, John Hoyt, and Elisha Cook Jr.\nDirector: Antonio Santean\n\nA pair of LA cops are scratching their heads. They have a smoking gun, and a beautiful murder suspect, but the case just doesn't add up. High on style, low on budget, this forgotten film was shot on location in the city of Angeles and even features the iconic Bradley Building. If you ever wished Herk Harvey made a 2nd feature, this PizzaFLIX might be for you.\n\nTRIVIA: Arlene Martel, best remembered as Spock's Vulcan bride, is billed here under her birth name Arline Sax. Cast also features King Moody, the future Ronald McDonald circa 1969 to 1985.",
