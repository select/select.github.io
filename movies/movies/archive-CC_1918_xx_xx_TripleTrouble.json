        "Charlie Chaplin's 50th Film released In 1918. (put together by Essanay from unfinished Chaplin films two years after he had left the company) Triple Trouble was a silent film released in 1918. It starred Charlie Chaplin, Edna Purviance and Leo White. This film was not an official Chaplin film, even thought it has many Chaplin directed scenes. The film was produced and edited by Essanay Films, with Leo White as director for new scenes. The actual film was created from left over film stock Essanay Films had in their collection. Since Chaplin did not own the copyright during his time with Essanay, he had no control over its release. It was made up from left over scenes from Police and from an unfinished Chaplin film called Life. Leo White filled in the rest. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007476/",
