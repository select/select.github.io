He serves 4 years in prison, and his hand is amputated; upon his release he seeks revenge on the sheriff who sent him to prison. He takes eight villagers as hostages and threatens to kill one every 10 minutes as long as the sheriff refuses to talk with him. After the Mexican has killed three of the eight hostages, the sheriff arrives. The Mexican tries to draw his gun with his right hand and in consequence is killed.",
