      "description": "Title: The Eclipse: Courtship of the Sun and Moon Summary: As the clock strikes twelve, a weary astronomer attempts to answer the impertinent enquiries of his young students by scrutinising an impending lunar eclipse, as an effeminate and delicate moon caresses the mighty sun's hungry cosmic rays. Directed by: Georges Méliès Actors: Directed by Georges Méliès. With Mlle. Bodson, Manuel, Georges Méliès. As the clock strikes twelve Production Company: Star-Film Release Date: 1907 (France) Aspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1 What inscrutable secrets lie deep into the boundless cosmos that surround us? Riddled with questions about man's origin and his place in the universe, a weary and respectable astronomer attempts to answer the impertinent enquiries of his young students by scrutinising an impending lunar eclipse. Soon, the clock strikes twelve, and a glorious parade of enormous celestial bodies, brilliant wandering stars, and sparkling comets pass before their phallic telescopes, as an effeminate and delicate moon caresses the mighty sun's hungry cosmic rays. Indeed, this eerie astral euphoria is contagious--and by the end of this ardent sun and moon courtship--the grizzled stargazer will be overwhelmed by the wondrous harmony of all creation.",
