      "description": "Hello and a horrible hearty welcome to your favorite internet drive in. Better late than never, we are pleased to bring Summer in with some wonderfully spooky \"Spaghetti\" horrors. After the usually tacky and wacky coming attractions and music featurette, we proudly present everyone's favorite 60s scream queen, Barbara Steele, in \"The She Beast\" (look close and some of Miss Steele's more prominent assess will be revealed). Following a brief intermission, we bring you Mario Bava's spook-house drama, \"Kill Baby Kill\". As always, pack up the kids, drop them off at grandma's house and bring your better half down to the drive in for some backseat noodling and \"Summer Spaghetti\".
