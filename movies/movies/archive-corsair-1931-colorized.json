      "description": "Entertaining comedy-drama about a bored young stockbroker who decides to give it up and become a pirate. Stars a great cast for those who love early movies: Chester Morris ('Boston Blackie'), Thelma Todd (billed as 'Alison Loyd' here), Mayo Methot (ex-wife of Humphrey Bogart), delightfully grouchy Ned Sparks, and wonderfully silly William Austin. Includes what is probably Ned Sparks's only kissing scene! Colorized using DeOldify technology.

Please don't put them on your own YouTube channel and monetize them. Thanks.)",
