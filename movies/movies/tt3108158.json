Her father, former detective Akihiro Fujishima, begins an obsessive search for her, tracking down her former middle school teacher, classmates, and her juvenile delinquent friend Endo for clues. Fujishima is a lonely man who's seemingly blind to the fact that his own actions caused the collapse of his family. He becomes convinced that his search for Kanako somehow holds the key to fixing all of that, but as he continues his investigation, he's faced with a series of shocking revelations along the way and discovers that Kanako lived an entirely different life from the pristine image she presented. ~~ Adapted from the novel \"Hateshinaki Kawaki\" by Akio Fukamachi.",
