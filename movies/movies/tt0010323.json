      "description": "\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (German: \"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari) is a 1920 silent horror film directed by Robert Wiene from a screenplay by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. It is one of the most influential of German Expressionist films and is often considered one of the greatest horror movies of the silent era.The film used stylized sets, with abstract, jagged buildings painted on canvas backdrops and flats. These unique sets gave off somewhat of a theatrical sense. To add to this strange style, the actors used an unrealistic technique that exhibited jerky and dancelike movements. This movie is cited as having introduced the twist ending in cinema.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Robert Wiene, produced by Rudolf Meinert and Erich Pommer, written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, starring Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Fehér, Lil Dagover and Hans Twardowski.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
