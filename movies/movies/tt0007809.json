[ 1 ] Plot Harold Lloyd and Snub Pollard are \"two famous lascars\" who annoy several wooing couples in a public park. Eventually their antics enrage a large suitor who violently tosses them into a shallow lake. Lloyd and Pollard emerge from the lake and fall asleep on a park bench where they simultaneously dream of living in caveman times. While there, they try to woo a royal harem and run afoul of the caveman king and his club-swinging minions. Lloyd and Pollard divert their pursuers into a pond where a crocodile resides and have the harem to themselves. As they embrace the females, they both wake up on the park bench embracing each other. A park policeman breaks up their embrace. Lloyd and Snub eventually trap the policemen in the crook of a low tree, but are soon on the run from dozens more officers of the law.
