      "description": "Mexico and Southern California are the playgrounds for this 2am Theater’s menagerie of monstrous nightmares. Tonight’s drive-in scream fest opens with previews of shrieks to come. Then in “The Black Scorpion” Richard Denning and Mara Corday can’t prevent gigantic arachnids from attacking Mexico City. Next in “The Monster That Challenged the World” it’s the mollusks’ turn when gruesome giant slugs eat delicious beach babes and everyone else in the Salton Sea. (bon appetit!) ",
