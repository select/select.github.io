      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with either poster art or a still shot from one of the movies with drive-in style audio. Burning this is beyond easy: Download the zipped folder, open it, and extract the VIDEO TS folder. Grab a blank DVD and burn the VIDEO TS folder onto it, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site This DVD features, yet again, another Roger Corman double bill, THE WASP WOMAN & THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH (color version), along with the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show!",
