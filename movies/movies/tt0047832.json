      "description": "In  The White Angel, , Raffaello Matarazzo’s sequel to his blockbuster  Nobody’s Children,  the perpetually put-upon Guido and Luisa (Amedeo Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson) return for a new round of trials and tribulations. This time, the reversals of fortune are even more insanely ornate, a plot twist involving doppelgängers beats  Vertigo to the punch by three years, and the whole thing climaxes with a jaw-dropping women-in-prison set piece.",
