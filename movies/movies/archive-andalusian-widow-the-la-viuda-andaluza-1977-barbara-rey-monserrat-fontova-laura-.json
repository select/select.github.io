      "description": "From IMDb: Lozana, a young, beautiful and clever woman decides to move to the city after a tragic love story. There, she meets Rampin, a naughty rascal who soon finds out that her wit surpasses his own by a handful. When he falls in love with her, he can't help suffering as he sees how she plays not only with him, but with all of her lovers as well. --------- Could not find subtitles for this one but the plot is easy enough to follow. Lots of songs that I suspect are half the fun of the movie",
