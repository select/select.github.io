Alice Faye as June Mills Dana Andrews as Eric Stanton Linda Darnell as Stella Charles Bickford as Mark Judd Anne Revere as Clara Mills Percy Kilbride as Pop Bruce Cabot as Dave Atkins If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
