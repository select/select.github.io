      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. After the critical and commercial low point of his previous film, Buster Keaton set out to make a more exciting and accessible picture. The Navigator follows two people who are stranded on a cruise ship together, and their comedic attempts to try and to make it back to land. The film was a huge hit financially and critically, serving to allow Keaton to make multiple more films afterwards. ",
