      "description": "After discovering that her teenage daughter accidentally killed her older lover, Lucia Harper (Joan Bennett) tries to dispose of the body. Another man (Roy Roberts) is in possession of love letters linking the daughter to the dead man, and he sends Martin Donnelly (James Mason) to blackmail Lucia. But as she desperately tries to raise the money, Donnelly starts to fall in love with her. James Mason as Martin Donnelly Joan Bennett as Lucia Harper Geraldine Brooks as Beatrice 'Bea' Harper Henry O'Neill as Tom Harper Shepperd Strudwick as Ted Darby David Bair as David Harper Roy Roberts as Nagel I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
