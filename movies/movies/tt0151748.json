    "Plot": "\"Radio with Pictures\" is often used as a put-down description of the sort of cartoon that began to show up after the Second World War. With shrinking budgets and staffs who no longer remembered the purely visual story-telling of silent films, it reached the point at which the entire lot was carried in the sound track. Despite my fondness for Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, one did not watch it for the pretty pictures or sight gags.This cartoon takes the concept, long before it became a necessity and does it up right. It takes the sort of western serial that children would listen to on the radio and adds the silly details that cartoons excelled in.Most Terrytoons are competently composed affairs intended solely for audiences of small children. This one offers a subtext commenting on that. That's probably why Donnelly and Rasinski wound up credited as co-directors. Neither wanted to give up credit.",
