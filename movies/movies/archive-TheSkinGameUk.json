      "description": "An early sound-film melodrama of two British families in conflict. Solid cast led by Edmund Gwenn. Filmed before in 1921 as an adaptation of the play by John Galsworthy. In later years Hitchcock said he hadn't wanted to make this film and he'd had little enthusiazm for its production. Adapted and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Released in 1931. Complete print (pre-war restoration). CAST NOTES: Edmond Gwenn repeats the role of Mr. Hornblower from the 1921 version. Helen Haye is also in this collection in the upgraded version of the Edgar Wallace old dark house mystery, \"The Case of the Frightened Lady.\"  https://archive.org/details/TheCaseOfTheFrightenedLadyVideoAudioUpgrade",
