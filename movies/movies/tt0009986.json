[ 1 ] Plot The Boy, a wealthy young man, awakens on his wedding day with a huge hangover after a wild bachelor party. When he is sober enough to call his fiancee, The Girl tells him that her overbearing mother has learned of the previous night's party and has forbidden the marriage to take place. Instead, the mother is taking her on a cruise to the Canary Islands. The Boy and his valet quickly board a ship setting sail to that destination. The Boy falls asleep and dreams he and his valet have been thrown overboard by robbers. The two are rescued, but it is by a shipload of hostile female pirates. The valet turns on The Boy to ingratiate himself with the pirates. The boy is put to work as the cook's assistant but causes so much chaos in the ship's galley that he is sentenced to walk the plank. The Girl, who is one of the pirates, tries to rescue the boy with the aid of a group of male pirates. After a series of escapes and battles, The Boy is about to be hanged when he awakens from his dream. He encounters The Girl and musters the courage to forcefully confront her disapproving mother and drive her away. The Boy also turns on his valet for his treachery in the dream.
