      "description": "“Female Satan of the Sahara” “She sent them into battle with her kisses burning on their lips” (promo tag lines). A French Foreign Legion adventure with an utterly forgettable cast and a plot so corny and absurd it seems like it was made in 1917 instead of 1937. Bad direction and bad editing, particularly of the action scenes, add insult to injury. So “Beau Geste” it’s not, but it is so-bad-it’s-good fun. IMDB rating 5.5. Directed by Hamilton MacFadden. Released in 1937. Complete print. AKA “Missing Men”",

Bob, Don and Bob's buddies, Muggsy and Bilgey, go to a café and there Don falls for Nina, a singer in love with Bob. Bob doesn't know this and thinks she is Garccia's girl, and warns Don to have nothing to do with her. Don disregards the warning and Garcia discovers Nina and Don together and provokes Don into hitting him. Don is arrested and thrown into the company brig. Nina, with the aid of an Arabian sheik, Ul Ahmed, helps Don escape. Bob, Muggsy and Bilgey follow but are captured and taken to Ul Hamid's headquarters. The sheik tortures Don to force Bob to work some captured machine guns for him. Ah Hamid and his tribe attack the fort, but Bob manages to turn the machine guns against his captors, and the fort is saved.",
