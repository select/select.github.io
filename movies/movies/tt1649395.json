    "Plot": "A French singer named 'Polin' sings a song about how it stinks to be a draftee in the army. Sadly the film has no subtitles but it's really not that important. What IS important is that the short is one of the earliest sound films...and although the sound on the accompanying disc is a bit tinny and flat, it's awfully amazing for 1905.Overall, this is a film deserving of a small audience, as most people would be bored by it. But it IS historically important and I am thrilled it's been reassembled and placed on YouTube for odd folks like me to enjoy!",
