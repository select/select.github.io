The child is kidnapped and raised as a slave by the Vikings. Eric ( Tony Curtis ) hates Einar ( Kirk Douglas ), Ragnar's second son. Unaware that they are half-brothers, the two heroes simultaneously fall in love with the English Princess Morgana ( Janet Leigh ).   As in 1960's \"Spartacus,\" lead actor Kirk Douglas also serves as producer.
