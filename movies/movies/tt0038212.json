      "description": "Roy Rogers has been managing the Bar X ranch for Dorothy (Dale Evans), with the Sons of the Pioneers as ranchhands, and the well-equipped, profitable Bar X is a far cry from the rundown, rocky ranch that adjoins it that belongs to Roy's friend Gabby Whittaker (George Hayes). Cattle broker Ben Bowman (Grant Withers) approaches Roy with a proposition to fleece Dorothy and split the profits, and Roy has a fight with Bowman and his henchman Steve Lacey (Hal Taliaferro). When the girls arrive, Roy is dismayed to learn that Dorothy intends to sell the ranch, and to restrain her from such a foolish action as getting rid of a profitable ranch, he and Gabby and the Pioneers trick her into believing that Gabby's run-down spread is the Bar X",
