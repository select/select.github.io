      "description": "Womanizing thug Klett is sprung from the courthouse by two accomplices, then sets about planning the big heist of a local bank, equipped with a cache of high-powered weapons he's acquired from an American army outpost. Together with his faithful protégé, who reluctantly on-boards his young girlfriend and her AWOL brother, the quartet bumble their way through the supposedly full-proof plan that aims to deliver them a cool million in cash and a new life in Australia. Predictably, things deteriorate quickly at every turn. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/blutiger-freitag-1972/",
