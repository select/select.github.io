      "description": "A scientific team is sent to a remote Pacific island to discover what became of a previous expedition. It turns out that they were eaten by a pair of gigantic mutated land crabs, which have become intelligent and absorbed the knowledge of the earlier team. They are also undermining the geology of the island, which will eventually cause it to dissolve into the ocean. Director/Producer: Roger Corman Richard Garland as Dale Brewer Pamela Duncan as Martha Hunter Russell Johnson as Hank Chapman Leslie Bradley as Dr. Karl Weigand Mel Welles as Jules Deveroux Richard H. Cutting as Dr. James Carson Beach Dickerson as Seaman Ron Fellows Tony Miller as Seaman Jack Sommers Ed Nelson as Lt. Quinlan I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
