      "description": "When Robert Cannon, the president of Boston-based Thornhill Software, learns of his younger brother’s fatal boating accident, he returns to his boyhood home on Nova Scotia’s South Shore to retrieve the body. But Robert is unprepared for Evie Shaw, owner of the marina from which his brother rented a boat the day that he died. Robert becomes obsessed with Kevin’s suspicious death — and with Evie.\n\n#freemovies #moviesondemand #fullmovie",
