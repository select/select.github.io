      "description": "Synopsis The Four Times works in the non-defined field between documentary and fiction, and can be understood in three different ways: as a science fiction film (without special effects), as an ethnographic documentary on some parts of the Calabrian Apennine, or as an essay about the human soul. The four episodes tell the stories of four âleading charactersâ: an old shepherd in the last days of his life; the birth and first few weeks of a goat kid till its first pasturing under the olive trees; the life of an old fir tree in the course of the seasons; and the transformation of the old fir into charcoal. All four episodes are set on the Ionian side of the Calabrian peninsula and are intertwined with each other in such a way as to make up one single story: the story of one soul that moves through four successive lives. -- TFL Cast: Giuseppe Fuda, Nazareno Timpano, Bruno Timpano 70 Views DIR Michelangelo Frammartino SCR Michelangelo Frammartino DP Andrea Locatelli CAST Giuseppe Fuda, Nazareno Timpano, Bruno Timpano ED Benni Atria, Maurizio Grillo PROD DES Matthew Broussard SOUND Simone Paolo Olivero, Paolo Benvenuti Cannes (Quinzaine des RÃ©alisateurs), Karlovy Vary (Open Eyes), Sarajevo, New York, Toronto (Visions), London (Film on the Square), Telluride, SÃ£o Paulo (New Filmmakers Competition), AFI (New Auteurs)",
