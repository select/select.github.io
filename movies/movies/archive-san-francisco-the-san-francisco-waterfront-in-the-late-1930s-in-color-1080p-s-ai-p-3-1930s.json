      "description": "Beautiful restored and colorized glimpses of San Francisco's Bay area almost a century ago. This film shows busy ferry traffic at the piers of the famous Ferry building at the end (or beginning as you wish) of Market Street. This Ferry building was one of the few structures that survived the 1906 earth quake. This was due to its foundation consisting of many wooden pillars. The Golden Gate bridge was brand new at the time of filming. It opened on 27 May 1937 to traffic. The San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge also comes clearly into view as well as various parts of the city. Sophisticated A.I. software was used to motion-stabilize, enhance and artificially colorize this footage. Please do not comment that the Golden Gate bridge should be red. The colorization simply did not know which bridge was involved. Music: Trevor Kowalski - Striving",
