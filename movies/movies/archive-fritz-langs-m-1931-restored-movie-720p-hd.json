The film’s screenplay was written by Lang and his wife  Thea von Harbou  and was the director's first  sound film . It features many cinematic innovations, including the use of long, fluid  tracking shots , and a musical  leitmotif  in the form of \" In the Hall of the Mountain King \" whistled by Lorre's character. Now considered a timeless classic, the film was deemed by Lang to be his  magnum opus . It is widely considered one of the  greatest films of all time , and an indispensable influence on modern crime and thriller fiction.",
