    "Plot": "IMDb doesn't give a running time for this title, but I doubt whether the version I saw - at 15 seconds long - is the complete film. Perhaps it is all that now exists. Either way, it isn't of much interest other than for the fact that it features no less than seven bare-breasted black ladies. They're filmed from a distance which adds an element of voyeurism to the film which must have added to the titillation for the target audience. The film on Daily Motion is so grainy and poor condition that there really isn't much more that can be said about it, but I've still got one line to go before I pass IMDb's mandatory ten line minimum review...",
