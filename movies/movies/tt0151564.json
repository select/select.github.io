      "description": "A pirate cat has his eyes set on a beautiful island mouse princess. He and his fellow pirates kidnap the beautiful girl. When singing cat pirates decide to kill all the mice on board for the buried treasure, the natives call to Mighty Mouse for help. Singing his way from the skies, Mighty Mouse flies to the pirate ship, fights buccaneers to the death, and saves the young beauty. He returns her to her people, to their thunderous applause. Lots of opera singing in this one. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/mighty-mouse-and-the-pirates-1945/",

    "Plot": "I am not a great fan of the Mighty Mouse series of cartoons from Paul Terry, aimed, as they are, at small children. However, this one is pretty good on its own terms as the Terry staff tries out a couple of new things. It is the first one pitched as a musical; the pirates, led by the bass pirate king, begin the cartoon with a song about their life, pitched midway between Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and Viennese operetta. There are also references to the Dorothy Lamour sarong efforts and even a few Tarzan gags thrown in. It still doesn't particularly move me, as it soon settles into Mighty Mouse beating up on the cats, sure to please the tykes who get to imagine the little guys beating the big guys, just like all the Mighty Mouse cartoons.The print I saw looks to have had either weird color choices, or perhaps the print aged poorly. The sea is green, the sky is mostly yellow and blues never appear on their own.",
