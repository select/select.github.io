His fiancée, Sudan Ainger (Stephanie Bachelor)is also working in Room 40. John's ten-year-old son, David (Bobby Cooper),at school in Switzerland is called home. The night before DAvid arrives home, John is murdered, but his twin brother Robert (Edgar Barrier),impersonates John and continues his work. Only Sir Christopher (C. Aubrey Smith)and David know of the plan. The safety of six high-ranking British officers who are taking a plane to Warsaw, depends on decoding Nazi messages.But the Nazis switch codes and solution seems impossible.",
