    "Plot": "\"Deschutes Driftwood\" is a very unusual film--and I can't say that I've seen another like this one. It's a travelogue combined with a bit of a story--an odd one to say the least. It's the hobo's point of view as he hitches a ride on the rails! You see him sneaking aboard and getting thrown off again and again and all this is actually just an excuse to show the beautiful scenery of the Pacific Northwest and the newly completed railroad. It's not the most exciting film you could see but it has two excellent things going for it--the great camera-work and scenes of the semi-virgin land as well as it's also a wonderful historic record.The only real negative in the film is its derogatory remark about Italians--which seems out of place. I guess it's just a sign of the times that such remakes are taken for granted! Still it's worth seeing and interesting.",
