      "description": "Government agent Dick Barton and his colleagues Snowy and Jock are investigating smuggling when they stumble upon a ring of Nazi spies who are planning to poison the entire London water supply. The first in a series of 3 movies based on the popular BBC radio drama. Also known as Dick Barton, Detective. Don Stannard as Dick Barton George Ford as Snowey White Jack Shaw as Jock Anderson Gillian Maude as Jean Hunter I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
