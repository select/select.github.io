      "description": "Not to be confused with Al Adamson's \"Dracula vs. Frankenstein\". Michael Rennie (dubbed by a different actor) plays a space alien bent on conquering the world by resurrecting all Earth's mad scientists and awakening the most deadly monsters in history; Count Dracula, The Mummy, the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster, all under their control. Eventually all the monsters duke it out in a burning castle. Paul Naschy plays his usual dynamic \"Wolfman\",\"Valdemar Daninski\" in what is the second of many films as that character. This film is designated public domain and is available from distributors that deal exclusively in public domain properties.",
