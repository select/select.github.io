The facility began in the early 20th century when the owner of Weir House, Teddington, allowed filmmakers to use his greenhouse. It was greatly expanded by E. G. Norman and Henry Edwards and renamed Teddington Film Studios Limited. After only one production, the studio was acquired by Warner Brothers-First National.",
