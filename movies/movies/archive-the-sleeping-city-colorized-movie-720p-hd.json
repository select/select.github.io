      "description": "The Sleeping City is a 1950 American film noir crime film in semidocumentary style that was set in and filmed at New York's Bellevue Hospital . Directed by George Sherman , it stars Richard Conte and Coleen Gray . The film is notable for its photography, and was one of the few motion pictures of the era to be shot entirely on location. The film begins with an unusual prologue, featuring Conte, to assure the audience that the story is \"completely fictional\" and did not take place at Bellevue or in New York City. The prologue was inserted at the insistence of New York mayor William O'Dwyer , who felt that the script besmirched the reputation of the city-run hospital.",
