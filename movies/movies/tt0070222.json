Anyway, how could you not like a movie with dialog like this: \"We balled and we balled and we balled, until he dropped dead.\" Besides, there are many happy endings, and it gives a whole new meaning to, \"What's the buzz?\" Directed by Denis Sanders. Released in 1973. (a.k.a. \"Graveyard Tramps\")",
