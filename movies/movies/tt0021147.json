      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This action-war film follows a gangster as he is drafted in the great war. The plot follows his time in the military and aftermath. George Bancroft led this film in the same year that he was nominated for an Oscar for Thunderbolt, although this film is decidedly less acclaimed. ",
