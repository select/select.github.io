      "description": "A former naval war hero (James Mason) fakes his defection to the Soviet Union in a crazy scheme to make money by later suing the newspapers for libeling him. He needs the money to impress the sophisticated American woman (Vera Miles) with whom he has fallen in love. But things do not go quite according to plan. Based on the novel \"The Megstone Plot\" by Andrew Garve. James Mason as Cmdr. Max Easton George Sanders as Sir Charles Holland Vera Miles as Virginia Killain Oliver Johnston as Minister Robert Flemyng as Cmdr. John Larkin William Kendall as Tom Duncan Lamont as Gregson Harry Andrews as Capt. Graham Peter Barkworth as Sub Lt. Brown Rachel Gurney as Clara Holland I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum",
