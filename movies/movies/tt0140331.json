    "Plot": "An illustrator draws some sketches at lightning speed. He first illustrates how he can turn a written word into a sketch of that word. The first word he writes is coon, which he transforms into a sketch of a black man. The next word he writes is Cohen, which he transforms into a sketch of a Jewish looking man. He is then visited on set by another man, who makes a smudge on the drawing surface. The illustrator turns that smudge into a sketch of that visiting man. And finally, he draws a drinking glass, a bottle of milk and a bottle of seltzer which take on lives of their own.",
