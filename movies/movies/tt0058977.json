      "description": "\"Blindfold\" is a 1965 American comedy-thriller film directed by Philip Dunne and starring Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale.  In the movie, Rock Hudson plays Dr. Bartholomew Snow, a psychiatrist, who becomes embroiled in a complex espionage plot. He is tasked with treating a mysterious patient named Arthur Vincenti, who is being kept in seclusion by the government after witnessing something he shouldn't have. To ensure Snow doesn't inadvertently reveal the patient's whereabouts, government agents \"blindfold\" him whenever he is transported to and from Vincenti's location. As the plot unfolds, Snow finds himself caught in a web of intrigue, with spies, counterspies, and double-crosses, while also developing a romantic relationship with Vincenti's sister, played by Claudia Cardinale. The film blends elements of suspense with comedic moments, capitalizing on Hudson's charm and comedic timing.",
