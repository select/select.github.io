      "description": "Grotesque erotic entanglements center around a Parisian womanizer and fashion journalist who can't decide between his constant sex adventures and his eternal fiancée.   An over-the-top comedy in the style of the \"swinging sixties\" that satirizes the sex and potency cult of the meritocratic society. Woody Allen's first screen appearance in a film based on his own screenplay. The following year, he realized the curious follow-up project \" What's Up, Tiger Lily .\"",
