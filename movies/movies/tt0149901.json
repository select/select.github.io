    "Plot": "A black sheep is mistreated by the white sheep in his flock until he loses his temper and exacts revenge in this SCRAPPY cartoon.It was a common progression for cartoon characters: they started out as leads in their own series and eventually wound up in a sort of presenting role. By the time of Scrappy's last cartoon in 1941 he had been relegated to this position; Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's efforts after about 1936 were largely in the same vein and even Mickey Mouse frequently appeared only long enough to set up the situation for Pluto.In this one Scrappy serves as shepherd to the flock, but his screen time is only about a third of this cartoon. The rest of it serves to tell the story of the black sheep. There are gags aplenty that should be fairly outrageous to the modern audience. Some of the gags have fallen out of public understanding, like the Apache dance, but some are simply bizarre. They average good enough to keep this cartoon interesting throughout.",
