As time passes without any enemy appearing, the soldiers' stress leads to erratic behavior, culminating in tragedy for Drogo and his comrades.",

Some fellow officers are eagerly awaiting an attack; some no longer want to believe in it; others take advantage of the vague threat to further their career. All of them are sacrificing everything -- health, youth, friends, family -- for a distant military ideal: leading the defence against the onslaught of the enemy.
