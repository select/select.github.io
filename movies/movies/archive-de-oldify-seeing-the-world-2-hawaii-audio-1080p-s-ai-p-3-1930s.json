      "description": "Let's take a time travel trip back to Hawaii in the early 1930s (A.I. enhanced & colorized)! This is the first episode in our new series called \"Seeing The World\" as seen through the camera of an unknown American couple who apparently travelled the world in Westerly direction, starting in the USA. Their first stop was the beautiful island of Oahu, one of the Hawaian islands. The film starts by showing interesting scenes of life on board the cruiseship. The swell and subsequent rolling of the ship on the Pacific Ocean must have been tremendous, to tell by the waves in the on board swimming pool. The guest on board enjoy all sorts off leasure activities, including a wooden horse race. As the ship approches the Hawaian coast, the distinct contours of the famous Diamond Head dead vulcano become visible. It is noticeable how pristine Waikiki beach still is in the 1930's with a total lack of high rise dwellings and hotels. The beach scenes are followed by visits to the interior and North coast of the island. On this trip the couple meets the local population, visits a water fall and is treated to a tradional Hawaian dance. The film ends with vistas over Honolulu and the famous Aloha tower. Sit back and relax to enjoy this great short film! Music: Rune Dale - Waikitschy Beat & Two Lane Road. Source: Archive.org",
