    "Plot": "When a new reformist mayor refuses to cave to corruption, his opponents plot terroristic reprisal. Their efforts go awry in very goofy ways (including some wild stunts). This rambunctious comedy from Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios features his stars Charles Murray as a scheming campaign manager and Louise Fazenda as the the fiancee he unwisely scorns in favor of the mayor's daughter. Initially released as BOMBS!, it is presented here in a retitled 1920 reissue print. - Dennis Harvey",
