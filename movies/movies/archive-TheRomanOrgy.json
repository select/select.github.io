      "description": "A short film made in Paris by Louis Feuillade in 1911. It shows the wicked life style and assassination of a Roman Emperor. In the first scene he is with a bevy of girls, in the second with a bevy of boys and in the third, we bring in the lions. Try to count the extras in this film, all playing individual roles,and then there were the lions. Enjoy.",
