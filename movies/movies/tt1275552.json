      "description": "“Worth your time” “The best 63 minutes you’ll ever spend” “Surprisingly good B-movie” (IMDB reviews quotes). If you like mysteries set on long-distance trains, you’ll love this one. It’s a pre-code pip! Ben Lyon stars at the head of a good cast that includes Dwight Frye and Nat Pendleton in a straight dramatic role. The production values are excellent. Highly recommended even for those who aren’t mystery buffs. IMDB rating 6.9. Directed by Ben Stoloff. Released in 1932. Complete print.",
