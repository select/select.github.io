    "Plot": "Hawaiian Girl Bird and Boy Bird are setting up housekeeping, and Boy Bird is busy building a nice nest when the Big City Orioles come through. Hearing hot jazz for the first time, Girl Bird is helplessly drawn to the tree where the Orioles are making music and can't help dancing-- and it isn't the minuet, folks. The bandleader invites her to join them and off she goes to the big mainland city, leaving a note for poor Boy Bird. He follows her to the Big City, where it's snowy winter and the heartless bandleader is just kicking Girl Bird out in the cold, having tired of her. She decides to End It All by tying down her wings and jumping off a skyscraper, but lands on Boy Bird partway down and All is Forgiven. Then it's back to their tropical love nest and Happily Ever After.",
