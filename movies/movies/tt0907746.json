      "description": "The High Sign by Buster Keaton, 1921. Should you need a reminder of what a great comic Buster Keaton was, go no further than here. He starts off with a brilliant scene of reading a newspaper, goes to a shooting gallery where he hooks up a Rube Goldberg devise to prove what a great marksman he is and ends up in a wild scene in a house full of hidden rooms and secret passages. Keaton was disappointed with this, his second independently produced film and held it back a year before he released it. It is A masterpiece of the form. Enjoy.",
