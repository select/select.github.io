      "description": "After a rainstorm ruins their picnic, Heckle & Jeckle make a wish on a wishbone that it will never rain again. Their wish only leads to a massive drought that dries up all of the water in the world. Realizing their mistake, the pair invent a makeshift helicopter and head for the clouds. They cause the clouds fight amongst themselves and rain is finally produced. The magpies return home to a hero's well-deserved- and wet- parade.
