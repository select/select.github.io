      "description": "The 2am Theater presents two horror cult classics in a simulated midnight double feature at an inner-city second-run theater. First up are the customary horrific previews. Then Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and a defrosted monster are on a train ride from Hell in the “Horror Express.” Next in “City of the Dead” virgins check in but they don’t check out of the Ravens Inn. NOTE: Both features are presented in their fully restored, widescreen versions. “City of the Dead” is also known as “Horror Hotel.”",
