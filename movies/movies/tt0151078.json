    "Plot": "The Terrytoons are oddly interesting, mainly for anybody wanting to see (generally) older cartoons made by lesser known and lower-budget studios. They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content.Of a typically hit and miss year for Terrytoons, 'Irish Sweepstakes' is to me among the very worst. Good things are very few and are vastly overshadowed by the cartoon's bad things which is very nearly everything and the flaws are not minor. As has been said with other \"one of the worst\" cartoons 'Irish Sweepstakes' is only really to be seen for completest sake.Best asset is the music, which predictably is incredible. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action.Along with some occasional neat synchronisation, too far and between (a vast majority is sloppy), that is all that 'Irish Sweepstakes' has going for it in a good way.'Irish Sweepstakes' is one of the studio's worst looking cartoons from that year. Primitive and crude in the character designs and drawing, a lot of choppy transitions and there is nothing elaborate in the backgrounds, it's all simplistic. Furthermore, there is a lot of recycling, re-using and repetition going on, which is not clever and instead looks cheap and lazy.Likewise, the story is paper thin and formulaic with a big air of over-familiarity due to doing very little new with an old story. The characters are dull, which makes the conflict difficult to be interested in. Not to mention in parts stereotyped in a not-for-the-faint-hearted way. The atmosphere is bland and careless in its detail.Gags are too few and generally don't quite have the lustre, imagination and cleverness needed, due to too much of the material being stale from being used before, and the cartoon sometimes feels choppy, generally there is not enough charm, the pace is not tight enough (very draggy in spots) and a minute longer wouldn't have hurt it.All in all, very poor. 2/10 Bethany Cox",
