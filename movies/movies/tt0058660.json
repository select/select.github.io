Revolted, Cass saves Nellie by running away with her and hiding in a hotel room. Arrested by the deputies, Cass and Nellie face the drunkard Judge Roy Bean. He has a bar set up in his courtroom and, in between cases, the audience and the judge wet their whistles. In order to save the town's morality the judge marries Cass and Nellie. As gift, the newlyweds get a free hotel room with the judge's compliments. While riding outside Silver City, Nellie and Cass unexpectedly run into Jesse James and his men. Worse still, Billy Pimple hasn't forgotten about Cass either.",
