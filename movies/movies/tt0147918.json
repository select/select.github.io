I'm a bum\" encounters the home of a Mister Lavish McTavish who adopts the cat and promises him all the food he can eat... but ONLY if the cat proves his worth by capturing the mice loose in his house. As it turns out, there is only one mouse in the house who makes a deal with the cat to save his skin. The cat pretends to capture a number of different mice (each time the same mouse in a different get-up) and each time is rewarded by McTavish with a heaping mouthful of beans. However, the cat eventually grows sick of beans and decides to eat the mouse but the clever rodent only gets him to eat more and more beans! Finally, the cat truly captures the mouse and McTavish promises the biggest meal of beans ever as a reward. Fed up, the cat flees the house only to end up in Boston... and more beans!",
