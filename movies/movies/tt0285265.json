    "Plot": "Nothing new, but an old thing done over again and done well. Some one has attempted to describe a kiss as \"something made of nothing,\" but this is not one of that kind, but one of those old fashioned \"home made\" kind that sets the whole audience into merriment and motion, and has always proven a popular subject. It is very fine photographically and an exhibit is not complete without it.",
