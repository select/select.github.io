      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. An egotistical football player at a military academy must learn to be more humble after accidentally injuring his friend. He also meets a girl that makes him reconsider his actions. This picture stars Joan Crawford and William Haines, who were both solid box office draws at the time. ",
