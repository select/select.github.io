      "description": "1932 directed by Victor Halperin starring Bela Lugosi, Madge Bellamy, Joseph Cawthorn, Robert Frazer, John Harron and Brandon Hurst and George Burr Macannon as Van Gelder the Zombie, John Printz as Ledot the Zombie and Dan Crimmons as Pierre the Witch Doctor. Monsieur Beaumont convinces a young couple to get married on his Haitian plantation. But Beaumont's motives are purely seedy as he has a bad case of the hots for the bride. So bad, in fact, that he turns to the sinister Murder Legendre for help in controlling her mind. There are a lot of copies of White Zombie on the Archive but this one is probably the best.",
