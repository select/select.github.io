      "description": "A French bedroom style farce, a down-on-their-luck married society couple (Dorian and Warren) persuade an unmarried pair (Valentino and Myers) to take their places at a party while they pretend to be the servants to impress a man of means who may give them money and assistance. In contrast to the screen persona of \"The Great Lover\", Valentino's character of Richard Thayer is shy and insecure. For this film, he performed several scenes of physical comedy and pratfalls, including falling from a window into a barrel of water, all of which he relished. He was originally billed in the film as Rodolpho de Valentina.
