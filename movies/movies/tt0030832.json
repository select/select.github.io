      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: Unsatisfied with MGM’s first two Tarzan films, novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs decided not to renew his contract. Instead, he co-founded Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises with Ashton Dearholt for the filming of THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN. He aimed to stay true to his novel’s portrayal of Tarzan as a cultured and well educated gentleman, which he succeeded. He also sought greater financial returns, which he did not, and Burroughs was soon back with MGM.  \n\nStars: Bruce Bennett, Ula Holt, Frank Baker\nDirector: Edward A. Kull\n\nA sequel of sorts  to the 1935 \"New Adventures of Tarzan,\"  made from the last ten chapters of the serial plus some previously unused footage.",

He had been there assisting Major Martling and Ula Vale in their quest for the Green Goddess, a totem worshipped by a primitive jungle tribe inside of which was hidden a formula for a super-explosive. They had successfully wrestled this totem from the natives and were heading back to Livingston when they were attacked by Raglan, a thug sent to steal the Green Goddess and its formula for Hiram Powers' personal use, and the Goddess is seized from them. On the trail of Raglan, they had to deal with his henchmen and also a party of the primitives, sent by the High Priest to retrieve the Goddess. With the Goddess still in Raglan's hands, they were seized by the natives and Tarzan locked in a small cell with a loosely-tethered lion, Ula in an adjacent cell under guard from a hideous jungle hag, and Martling being forced to watch his bumbling valet, George, being tortured by the natives with the assistance of a nameless expatriate white scientist who had joined forces with the primitives...",
