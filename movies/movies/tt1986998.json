    "Plot": "It was a bachelor's life for hard-working and fun-loving Ray Ray Domingguez who dreams of leaving the barrio for a more carefree existence in Miami. That's until one day when everything changed - and he became a reluctant \"Tio Papi\" to his sister's six children ages 6 to 16. Now in charge of raising this energetic (and expensive)clan, Ray Ray must make important decisions on what life is really all about. Combining heart-warming drama with light hearted comedy, \"Tio Papi\", directed by Fro Rojas from the original screenplay by Joey Dedio and Brian Herskowitz, is an upbeat story of life's unexpected surprises and ultimately what matters the most -- the love of family.",
