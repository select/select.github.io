      "description": "This special tribute to the lost art of screwball comedy is a simulated double feature program at a second-run movie house in the 1940s: Your evening of chuckles and belly laughs begins with coming attractions and a cartoon followed by William Wellman's hilarious put-down of instant celebrity culture, \"Nothing Sacred\" starring Carole Lombard and Fredric March. Next up is Howard Hawks' fast-talking battle-of-the-sexes masterpiece, \"His Girl Friday\" starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell backed by an outstanding supporting cast.",
