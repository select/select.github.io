      "description": "Explosion of a Motor Car (1900) Director: Cecil M. Hepworth Explosion of a Motor Car (AKA: The Delights of Automobiling) is a 1900 British silent comic trick film, directed by Cecil M. Hepworth, featuring an exploding automobile scattering the body parts of its driver and passenger. \"One of the most memorable of early British trick films\" according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"was one of the first films to play with the laws of physics for comic effect.\" It features one of the earliest known uses in a British film of the stop trick technique discovered by French filmmaker Georges Méliès in 1896, and also includes one of the earliest film uses of comedy delay – later to be widely used as a convention in animated films – where objects take much longer to fall to the ground than they would do in reality.",
