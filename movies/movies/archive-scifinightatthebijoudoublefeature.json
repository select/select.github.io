      "description": "Peer into the future as the 2am Theater presents two science fiction adventures. But first there are previews of the world of tomorrow. Then in “The Time Travelers” scientists climb through a window in their cheesy lab, and poof! They’re 100 years into the future! Who knew it could be that easy? Next the post-apocalypse is filled with monsters and other horrors in “Day the World Ended,” the low-budget remake of the low-budget “In the Year 2889.” According to these reports the world of tomorrow sucks.",
