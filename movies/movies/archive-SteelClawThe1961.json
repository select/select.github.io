      "description": "From IMDb; A Marine stationed in the Philippines loses a hand in an accident and is discharged from the Corps. When the Japanese invade the Philippines, he is called back into service to rescue a general held by Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines. Attaching a steel prosthetic in place of his missing hand, he and his men set out on the mission, which turns out to be not quite what he was told it was. Written by frankfob2@yahoo.com Stars: George Montgomery, Charito Luna and Mario Barri",
