      "description": "“Murder, music and malice in the old South” “’Gone with the Wind’ on speed” (IMDB reviews quotes). A hodgepodge of a movie that can’t decide if its a romantic comedy, a romantic drama or a musical. Joan Blondell and John Wayne costar, but Wayne really has a supporting role. Hattie Noel is particular fun as Blondell’s no-nonsense maid. The production values are good even though they unbelievably include French cancan dancers from the Folies Bergere. Well it is what it is, so just throw your hands and enjoy. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Leigh Jason. Released in 1942. Complete print. TRIVIA: This film was the inspiration for naming the famous WW2 B-17 bomber “Memphis Belle.”",
