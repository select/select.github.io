    "Plot": "In Pikeville, the on again off again engagement between Ruth Hawkins and Walter Yates is off again after Ruth calls it off because of him laughing at her singing voice, which she believes is beautiful. She sees a photo of Baron Bonamo, international ladies man, in a magazine, he who travels the world on his brand of horseback making a name for men everywhere. To make Walter jealous, she writes herself a letter signed by Bonamo, stating that he is in love with her because of her singing voice. Meanwhile, Pearl Pepper, a plain Jane of a woman who is also from Pikeville, runs across Baron Bonamo in her travels and falls under his spell, although he has no interest in her. Pearl's roughneck father, Colonel Pepper who is traveling with her, believes there is impropriety between Bonamo and his daughter for which he will not stand - they get married or else. When they collectively arrive in Pikeville, complications ensue with now two women who are so-called in Bonamo's life, one he doesn't want, and another who he's never even met.",
