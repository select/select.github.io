      "description": "Pathe comedy with Max Linder, Jacques Vandenne The story tells of two sons and a father, all of whom are paying separate and clandestine attentions to the same girl. They arrive one after the other, and are secreted in various parts of the room, where they remain until all three suddenly peep out together. The final scene, where the elderly papa is enjoining a discreet silence upon his son, is, perhaps the best thing of the kind Messrs. Pathe have yet done. (The Bioscope, Oct. 21, 1909)",
