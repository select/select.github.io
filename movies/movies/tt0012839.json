That day, Robert's son, Danny, is caught in an unprotected belt and dies. Evans, stricken with grief, rescues the infant son of Chapple from an automobile when it plunges into a river, then kidnaps the baby and claims him as an adopted son. Chapple befriends Evans, however, and when the worker sees that restoration of the child is important to Mrs. Chapple's welfare, he confesses his actions and surrenders the child.",
