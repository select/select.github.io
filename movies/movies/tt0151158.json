    "Plot": "You can tell this is supposed to be set in Mexico because all the mice wear those high-crowned, wide brimmed straw hats that evolved into the ten-gallon hat. The villainous cat wears one too.This is a very good Terry cartoon from the dawn of sound cartoons. It's mostly a synchronized cartoon, because the techniques of animating mouths -- particularly mice mouths -- was neither reliable nor cheap. Still, it's a very good cartoon, with a lot of well-timed gags, even if they average more Western than Mexican. There is also a single gag referring to Mexican jumping beans -- they still had them when I was a kid, although the ones I got never jumped or did much of anything.",
