      "description": "A globetrotting hitman and a crestfallen businessman meet in a hotel bar in Mexico City in an encounter that draws them together in a way neither expected. Sharply funny, well paced, good story. Worth watching for Brosnan's stroll through the hotel lobby; anti-Bond to the nth degree. And, it has Hope Davis.",
