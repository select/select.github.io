      "description": "A unfaithful wife (Helen Walker) plots with her lover to kill her husband (Brian Donlevy), but the lover is accidentally killed instead. The husband decides to get some revenge by letting his wife be charged with his murder while he starts a new life and meets a new woman (Ella Raines) in another town. Brian Donlevy as Walter Williams Ella Raines as Marsha Peters Charles Coburn as Lt. Quincy Helen Walker as Irene Williams Anna May Wong as Su Lin Tony Barrett as Jim Torrence I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
