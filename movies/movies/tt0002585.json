    "Plot": "The discouraged prospector is about to give up his search for the coveted ore, when he hears his two little children praying, \"Please, God, help papa find gold.\" Their faith gives him new hope and their prayer is efficacious, for he does find it and so stakes the claim, intending to register it at his earliest opportunity. While the little family is lunching at their camp, \"Faro Kate\" and her gambler husband ride by the claim and jump it, the husband urging Kate to go to the Claim Office and register it. Kate, who does not see the necessity for haste, is slow in starting. When the prospector returns to his \"diggings\" he finds the gambler in possession and in the struggle which ensues the prospector falls and is hurt. The prospector's wife, arriving at the claim, realizes the situation in a flash and is determined to win the race to the Claim Office, for she feels that the claim jumper has started for that place. By a most unique trick of fate she wins out.",
