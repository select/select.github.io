      "description": "This is the sharpest and cleanest print I’ve seen and a significant improvement over the other IA copies. “Hugely imaginative” “Visually stunning” “Unique example of serious science fiction” “Inspiring” “Striking futuristic vision” (IMDB reviews quotes). H G Wells and William Cameron Menzies present the first great science fiction/future fiction epic of the sound-film era, with a superb cast and stunning visual effects which for impact have never been surpassed. Highly recommended. IMDB rating 6.7. Directed by William Cameron Menzies. Released in 1936. Complete print.",
