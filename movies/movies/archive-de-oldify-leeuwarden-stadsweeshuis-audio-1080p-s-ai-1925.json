      "description": "Endearing images of an orphanage in the Dutch town of Leeuwarden nearly a century ago. Leeuwarden is the capital of the province of Friesland. This province is know for its many lakes and typical sailing boats called \"Skûtjes\". It is also know for its 11 cities ice scating competion that is occasionally held during extremely cold winter period. This orphanage was established as early as in 1675 and remained in function until 1923 when it was turned into a natural history museum. At present it still serves as a museum. In its hay day the orphanage housed hundreds of children. Some can be seen here with there home made dolls, showing off their school costume and dancing around the monument in the courtyard. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of sophisticated A.I. software.
