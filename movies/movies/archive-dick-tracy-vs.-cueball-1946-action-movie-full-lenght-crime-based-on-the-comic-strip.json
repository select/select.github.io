      "description": "When bald bad guy Cueball (Dick Wessel) realizes that he's been betrayed by his crew of criminals, he starts hunting them down, one by one. Continuing on his rampage, the villain also decides to eliminate his arch nemesis, Dick Tracy (Morgan Conway), but the tough-guy detective is more than ready to  put up a fight. Though the conflict means Tracy must spend time away from his lady, Tess Trueheart (Anne Jeffreys), it may give the sleuth a chance to defeat Cueball once and for all.",
