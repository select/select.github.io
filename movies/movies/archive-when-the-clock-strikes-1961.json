      "description": "When a storm blocks the road, several people who were on their way to witness a condemned man's midnight exection end up at an isolated lodge, where they discover discrepancies in the case, as well as inforaation about some hidden money. James Brown as Sam Morgan Merry Anders as Ellie Henry Corden as Cady Roy Barcroft as Sheriff Mitchell Peggy Stewart as Mrs. Pierce Francis De Sales as Warden Jorge Moreno as Martinez I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
