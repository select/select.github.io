      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the existing IA copy. Heartbroken looser in love Olly joins the French Foreign Legion to forget, and of course he drags along Stan who forgets everything. One of the funniest L&H feature-length comedies with great slapstick routines and magical moments like Stan playing \"The World is Waiting for the Sunrise\" on a bedspring while he and Olly are waiting to be shot at dawn. A must-see for all fans of the eternally hapless duo. Directed by A Edward Sutherland. Released in 1939 a.k.a.\"Flying Aces\" TRIVIA: Oliver Hardy met his future wife, Virginia Lucille Jones, on the set. She was the script supervisor. PERSONAL NOTE: The first time I saw this film the ending made me cry. I was too young to get the reincarnation joke.",
