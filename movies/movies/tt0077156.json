Once Nemo is revived, the government makes a deal with him to refit his ship with a few modern technologies in exchange for his helping to defeat Professor Cunningham, a mad genius threatening to destroy Washington with a missile from his own submarine unless he is paid a billion dollars. Later, Nemo continues and completes his search for the sunken city of Atlantis, delayed 100 years by his long time in stasis.",
