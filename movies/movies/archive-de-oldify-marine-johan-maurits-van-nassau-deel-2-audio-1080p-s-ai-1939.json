      "description": "This is part-2 of my documentary about the Dutch Navy Gunboat Hr.Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau during World War II. This ship played a very important role in the defence of The Netherlands against the German invasion in the early days of WW-II in May 1940. By shelling German positions on the Afsluitdijk, the crew of this ship managed to temporarily halt the German advance towards the populated West of the country. This film is dedicated to my father who served on this Gunboat from January 1939 until May 1940. The full story in English can be read here: The full story in English can be read here: https://www.ricksfilmrestoration.com/JohanMaurits1.htm . The original B&W film footage has been meticulously restored, enhanced and colorized by means of modern artificial intelligence (A.I.) video software and subsequently edited and included with a (Dutch) narrative. The full story about the Hr.Ms.Johan Maurits van Nassau can be read here in Dutch and English: https://www.ricksfilmrestoration.com/JohanMaurits1.htm in het Nederlands https://www.ricksfilmrestoration.com/JohanMaurits2.htm in English Even more information (in Dutch) can be found in the great books by K.Bezemer entitled \"Zij vochten op de zeven zeeën\". These books were published in 1964 and can only be purchased second hand. Note: Please note that most of the Dutch Navy ships that appear in this film are the real thing. However, combat scenes and some other footage come from various, sometimes unrelated sources involving Naval operations during WWII, in order to support the narrative.
