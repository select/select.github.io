      "description": "Star Theatre (1901) Director: Frederick S. Armitage Star Theatre (also known as Demolishing and Building Up the Star Theatre) is a 1901 short documentary film in which time-lapse photography is used to show the dismantling and demolition of New York City's Star Theatre over a period of about a month. Produced by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (often shortened to Biograph), it was filmed by F.S. Armitage. In 2002, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry.[1][2] Production: Formerly called Wallack's Theatre, the Star Theatre was located across the street from Biograph's offices on Thirteenth Street and Broadway in New York City, New York. Taking advantage of his view from his office, Armitage set up a camera and used \"a specifically devised electric apparatus\" to shoot every four minutes, eight hours a day. He also shot about thirty seconds of standard exposures at the beginning and end of the demolition process to set and close the scene. Biograph publicists encouraged exhibitors to show the film advancing regularly and in reverse, adding \"The effect is very extraordinary.\"[3] -From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

    "Plot": "This film shows the demolition of the historic Star Theatre building (formerly Wallack's) at the corner of Broadway and 13th Street, New York. To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.",
