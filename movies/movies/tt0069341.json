After a tragic car accident, he discovers the consequences of his choices, leading to a haunting confrontation with his own fate. Poetic Justice : A woman seeks vengeance on her unfaithful husband and his mistress. The story culminates in a grisly act of retribution that feels almost poetic in its execution. Wish You Were Here : A man discovers a genie-like creature that grants him wishes, but each wish unfolds with unintended and gruesome consequences. Blind Alleys : A sadistic man running an old-age home mistreats the residents. The story concludes with a horrifying twist of fate for the man, who faces the consequences of his cruelty. The film explores themes of justice, revenge, and the macabre, with a blend of dark humor and moral lessons. Each story culminates in a twist, showcasing the film's iconic approach to horror storytelling.",
