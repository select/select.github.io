      "description": "Ask Father Written by H.M. Walker Produced by Hal Roach Starring Harold Lloyd Release date February 9, 1919 Running time 13 minutes Country United States Languages Silent English intertitles Ask Father is a short , 13-minute, slapstick-style comedy made by Harold Lloyd in 1919 before his entry into full-length feature films. Aside from Lloyd, it features Snub Pollard and leading lady Bebe Daniels . [ 1 ] Plot Lloyd is a serious young middle-class guy on the make, who wants to marry the boss’ daughter. The problem is getting in to see the boss so that he can ask for her hand in marriage; the office is guarded by a bunch of comic, clumsy flunkies who throw everyone out who tries to get in. When Lloyd gets into the boss’ office, the latter uses trap doors and conveyor belts to expel him; Lloyd then goes to the costume company next door, tries to get in wearing drag (no success), and then in medieval armor – that works, since he bangs everyone over the head with his club. When he learns that the daughter has eloped with another suitor, Lloyd decides to be sensible and he settles for the cute switchboard operator (Daniels) instead. The film includes a brief wall climbing sequence.
