    "Plot": "I know I might sound cruel, but most cartoons in the 1930s (with the exception of those of Disney and the Fleischers) were awful. They had no sense of humor and were just cute drivel--which is why they are very rarely shown today. The only place you usually find stuff like it are in the 100 cartoon boxes sold for $5-10! The price should tell you something! \"Chinese Lanterns\" by Van Beuren Studios is a great example of such drivel. While there's nothing offensive about the film, there also is nothing of any interest--no jokes...none. Instead, you see Chinese-like characters cavorting about and acting cute and with no plot...YECCH! My advice is you can do a lot better--even if this one is made using Cinecolor--a rare early color stock used mostly (but not exclusively) in animation.",
