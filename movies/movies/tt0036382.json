    "Plot": "In \"Spotlight Scandals,\", the actual release title of this film (\"Spotlight Revue\" was the 1949 re-issue title), Frank Fay, a stranded actor, and Billy Gilbert, a small-town barber, combine to form a vaudeville act, and eventually become headliners at the top of their profession. Oscar Martin backs them in a lavish revue, installing his girlfriend, Bernice, as the featured dancer. She takes a liking for Frank. When the revue closes its run of 42-weeks, Bonnie Baker, singer on the radio program advertising her mother's Baker Bubble Gum, invites Frank to join her on the radio program. He refuses, however, when the Bakers declines to hire Billy. During their prosperity, Billy has accumulated a modest fortune, but the improvident FRank has always lived up to his income, so Billy resolves to take sacrifice-measures to induce his partner to quit the stage, and the angry Frank, accepts the radio engagement. Bonnie likes her new partner, and eventually she and Bernice fight over the popular comedian. Going to FRank's penthouse, Bernice falls out of a window, and is killed. Unknow to Frank, Billy mortgages all his property to pay for expensive lawyers, transmitting the money through Blondell, the act's former agent. Fay is acquitted of manslaughter but is apparently ruined as a performer, and disappears. Billy, with his sons Butch and Buddy, gets an engagement in a new act, and is amazed when Frank, seated in the audience, begins to make his old-time comedy interruptions...and the two actors are reunited for a new career.",
