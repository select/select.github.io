    "Plot": "One of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon's recently re-discovered films depicting the lives of ordinary northern folk back at the turn of the 20th century, this shows the good folk of the town of Halifax all dressed up in their Sunday best to witness the Catholic procession.The film is more interesting than many other 'procession' films of the time because the camera is situated closer to the people, giving the viewer a real flavour of what was going on. Although it's a silent film you can almost hear the noise and voices of the crowds. The streets throng with people and it's a wonder that some didn't fall foul of the buses or trams that can be seen fighting their way through the crowds.",
