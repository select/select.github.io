      "description": "“Running wild” “Absurdest gem” “Great fun and satire” “Amazingly dumb” (IMDB reviews quotes) W C Fields is the screwball president of a screwball country populated with zanies that include Jack Oakie, Hugh Herbert, Ben Turpin and Lyda Roberti, plus many more. For no sensible reason the mixed nuts head for the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. If you like high energy screwball comedy, this nonsensical collection of sight gags, quips and double entendres is for you. IMDB rating 6.9. Directed by Edward Cline. Released in 1932. 3 minutes are missing, AKA “On Your Mark”",
