The waitress, discovering the theft, gives the alarm and four policemen begin following the thieves. Robert Macaire and Bertrand meanwhile rob a bank and steal several costumes to disguise themselves as tourists. They leave their clothes in a garden and embark onto a train, the police behind them. They get off at the station, and an attendant tells the police which way they when the police arrive. Entering a town, an earthquake hits and the thieves fly through the air. They land and the police are again on their trail. To hide themselves Macaire and Bertrand must disclose themselves in a barn. The police soon discover their abode and shoot the thieves down, but Robert Macaire and Bertrand get up and escape after the police turn their backs. And, jumping into a hot air balloon, they float away, making rude gestures to the officers of the law.",
