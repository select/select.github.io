      "description": "Hello and welcome back to everyone's favorite Shocker Internet Drive In! Well, with the Thanksgiving holiday in the chilling November air, we thought that we would give thanks and break bread, not with our traditional friends, family, or even Native Americans, but we would give thanks for aliens - or \"Thanks- Giving, It's Aliens!\" First up, after some nice bicentennial wishes and a special message from John Wayne, we happily present \"UFO: Target Earth\" - a rather slow moving tale about some aliens providing the human race with the next messiah. Then, after a brief intermission, we give you the \"End of the World\" with Christopher Lee and some nasty aliens. So, we are going from one extreme to the other: friendly waterlogged aliens vs. earth-shattering ones. We can only give thanks that we could not find a third bad alien flick to add to our feature! http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://www.shockerredirect.tk/",
