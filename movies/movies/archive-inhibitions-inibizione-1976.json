      "description": "This movies has been cut and reedited so many times it could be used as a case study for censorship. I did manage to find some English subtitles but they were not the ones for the cut that I have. So, with some sloppy editing and retiming, I did manage to get them approximately correct. They are not definitive by any means. The main story seems intact but the comic relief provided by the two con men seems to have been cut out from the version the subs were meant for.  Still better than nothing, The story itself makes little sense so perhaps bad subtitles a proper fit.",
