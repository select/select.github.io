      "description": "While attempting to refloat their submarine, which has run aground off a North American island, a Russian submarine crew panics the population, who believe it is an invasion. After they rescue a child who has been in an accident, the chaos dissolves into a humanitarian aid effort for the Russians.. This film's satire on East-West tensions and latent fears of war, at times with an all too sweet naiveté, attempts to dismantle both sides' enemy stereotypes. Excellent acting.",
