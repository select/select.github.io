Directed by                Edward Sedgwick, Buster Keaton Produced by              Buster Keaton, Lawrence Weingarten Written by                 Story: Clyde Bruckman, Lew Lipton                                     Titles: Joseph Farnham Starring                      Buster Keaton, Marceline Day, Harold Goodwin, Harry Gribbon, Sidney Bracey Cinematography        Reggie Lanning, Elgin Lessley Editing by                   Hugh Wynn Distributed by            Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release date                September 22, 1928 Running time             75 minutes Country                      United States Language                    Silent film, English intertitles Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Buster Keaton's first film for MGM, The Cameraman is generally thought of as one of his best movies. It was the second to last picture he had full creative control over, before MGM took that from him. The film follows a poor street photographer who goes to extreme lengths to impress a woman he meets. ",
