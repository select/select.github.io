      "description": "The first of many films featuring the endearing single-dad Kihachi (played wonderfully by Takeshi Sakamoto), PASSING FANCY is a humorous and heartfelt study of a close, if fraught, father-son relationship. With an ever more sophisticated visual style and understanding of fragile human relationships, Ozu seamlessly weaves rib-tickling comedy and weighty family drama for this distinguished precursor to a brilliant career.",
