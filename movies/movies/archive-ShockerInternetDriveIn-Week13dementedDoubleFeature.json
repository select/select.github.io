      "description": "Well after some major renovations and reconstruction (after a slight computer mishap), we are pleased to announce that your friendly neighborhod Shocker Drive In is back open for business! (At least until the next CPU crash.) In an effort to celebrate our Grand Re-Reopening, we are pleased to bring you our \"Demented\" Double Feature - First up we are proud to bring your the excellent Francis Ford Coppola thriller \"Dementia 13\" followed by the equally creepy Vincent Price in \"The House On Haunted Hill\". As usual our presentation includes some wonderful vintage snackbar ads and a claasic cartoon. So drive on in, pick your spot, but remember we do patrol the last rows so no hanky-panky. Get your refreshments, turn up the speaker, sit back and enjoy the show!
