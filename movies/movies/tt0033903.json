When Dick O'Hara, forestry inspector, demands a postponement, MacGrgeor refuses and sends his henchman, Jean Collet, to obtain the services of the famous \"bull-of-the-woods\" Andy Jensen and his partner \"Lucky.\" Kay arrives and gives her permission to cut the timber, defying Dick. Dick, with his two assistants, Withers and \"Tex,\" begins a survey of the timber stand. When Dick and Tex finally reveal MacGrgeor as a crook, Collet is sent to kill \"Tex\" and obtain the reports. A fight ensues and \"Lucky\" is killed by one of Collet's flying knives. Kay then admits that Dick is right and helps him trap Collet. Dick and Andy force a confession from Collet and MacGregor is exposed.",
