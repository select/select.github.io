The old woman owns an oil-of-myrrh which she doles out on an as-needed basis to the makers of \"Temptation\" perfume who have offered her fabulous sums of money to buy out her entire stock of myrrh. The gang, led by George Trent (Wilton Graff) and Ed Praskins (Emory Parnell) , who hides his villainy behind a deceptive air of friendliness, orders Ann to find the myrrh stock, and when she does not succeed, she is in danger.",
