      "description": "This highly interesting film reports about the festivities in Grou (also sometimes spelled \"Grouw\"), presumably on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Queen Wilhelmina's government in 1923. Wilhelmina ascended the throne in 1898. Grouw is a village that resides under the town of Leeuwarden, the capital of the Dutch province of Friesland. This report starts with a procession of the local Frisian population, who march behind the harmony band. Traditional Dutch Oliebollen are sold at the fair and we see a merry-go-round. From the harbour, the camera takes a picture of the Pikmeer. Later on in this film we also see a procession of the local population with the harmony in a crowded street. There are detailed shots of its conductor and the musicians as well as children with castanets. Later on we see typical Dutch sailing boats as they leave the harbour for the Pikmeer lake where a sailing competition takes place. Spectators observe the spectacle in rowing boats and from various other ships like the \"Grouw\" and the \"Piet Hein\" as well as by crowds along the shore, Folk games include boys who climb through hanging barrels and girls who crawl through all sorts of obstacles. Towards the end of the film we see a street shot with a parade by the harmony band and among other the local \"Gymnastics association\". Many passers-by wave to the camera, Children cycle on the quay and the film ends with a pan past elderly gentlemen on a bench. This film has been meticulously restored, speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of the latest video software that uses Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct facial features, object contours, details and much more!
