      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the existing IA copies, and it's in the correct aspect ratio. Known for its highly atmospheric settings and structural similarity to \"Psycho,\" which was purely coincidental, \"City of the Dead\" was poorly received at its US and UK theatrical openings. This changed in 1963 when it was released to US television. It has since achieved cult status and is recognized as a horror classic. Directed by John Liewellyn Moxey (as John Moxey) UK release 1960 US release 1961 a.k.a. \"Horror Hotel\" (US) Complete print CAST NOTE: Venetia Stevenson is the daughter of noted director Robert Stevenson and actress Anna Lee, who is here at IA in \"Non-Stop New York\" and \"King Solomon's Mines.\" Venetia is also here at IA in \"Island of Lost Women.\"",
