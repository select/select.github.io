Your documentary brings a new awareness to the public of other silent film stars who deserve recognition while also mentioning the fact of lost films and the need to restore the films that are in storage. - Nina Roberts, grand-daughter of our star Joe Roberts (email message)   Hi Alex, thank you so much for sending me the link. I just watched it - very professionally made, and there is some amazing footage from silent movies with breathtaking stunts. - Shirley Freitas, great-granddaughter of our star Helen Holmes (email message)   Well done promotion for forgotten silent stars and the need to preserve their memories…I will post on my FB page. - Ned Thanhouser, Director and Producer, grandson of Edwin Thanhouser, the founder of the Thanhouser Company (email message)   Hi Alex, thanks for the link. I watched it this morning. Fantastic Job! - A. Michael Aus (email message)   I saw your documentary on silent era pioneers and loved it! Keep up your great work of recognizing the wonderful stars of the silent era! - silentmoviequeen (at YouTube)   Saw it, loved it - thanks so much! - alvisrocks (at NitrateVille)   Your documentary does a fine job emphasizing the importance of not only preserving silent films, but keeping them in circulation so that younger viewers can witness an important part of history unfold. Excellent work. - Zach Snow (email message)   I absolutely adored the documentary! Seeing so many of my favorite stars being shown was just incredible. And the end with Marceline Day's name imposed onto the star? Goosebumps! - Jessica Wahl (email message)   Watched it as soon as I got your email—what a lovely film! I will put a link to it on our library guide for videos. Thank you! - Leigh Rockey (email message)    ",
