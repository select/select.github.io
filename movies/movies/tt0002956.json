    "Plot": "The young wife visits her father's office and plays hide and seek with her little girl. The baby hides in the big vaults and the mother pretends she does not know where the child is. The mother is called by her father and goes to the other room for a few minutes and the little girl toddles out to the street. The clerk closes the vault and turns on the time lock. The mother returning to the room imagines the baby is in the vault and becomes frantic. She turns in a fire alarm and the engines respond. The police are called, and they rush to the office in a fast automobile. While these things are going on flashes are shown of the baby, who has made friends with a bulldog, and is leading it about. Finally she meets some other tots, and the kidlets have a good time together. Her mother and grandfather are frantic, and a safe expert is hurriedly sent for. It is decided to dynamite the vault door, and it is blown out. All rush into the vault, and are relieved to find the child is not there. In the midst of the excitement the father, who has found his little girl, walks into the office with the baby in his arms.",
