    "Plot": "When the village blacksmith is kicked by a customer, he loses his temper and eventually is knocked out in this Terrytoon.This one looks like Paul Terry's staff had to dig into their bag of gags to fill out this one. Among the standard 1930s gags are celebrity appearances. A poor caricature of Jimmy Durante appears, as do slightly better Laurel and Hardy figures.It's a bit incoherent, but undoubtedly the excuse of being knocked unconscious could be used to excuse that. Still, the resulting cartoon is not particularly good, despite some adult content. If you are a particular fan of Terry's studio, you might wish to see this one, but not otherwise.",
