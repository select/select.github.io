This results in a sprawling, chaotic dogfight featuring the aircraft that helped win the war – B-17 bombers and the P-51 Mustang fighters. The climactic action sequence is a daring raid on an airfield deep into Germany. The human element in the film are two brothers who have been close their whole lives, one a Thunderbolt pilot and one a B-17 tail gunner. Their nemesis on the German side is the first jet ace in history, a Luftwaffe Colonel who just might have had a hand in the loss of their father in the first world war.\n2019.  Stars: Brad Owens, Scotty Sparks, Bob Young\n\nRocket Hunter: In one of the most dangerous missions of the war, an American B-17 pilot volunteers to fly a surrendered Messerschmidt 109 on a daring flight through the heart of Germany to try to prevent the people of London from being terrorized by the V-2 rockets. \"Rocket Hunter\" tells the story of an amazing pilot and his bombardier brother from the time they are teenagers dreaming of taking to the skies to the dark days of January 1945.\n2020.
