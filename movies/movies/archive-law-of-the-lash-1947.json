      "description": "Marshal Lash LaRue and his partner Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) are sent for by Jim Thornton, who has found gold. But when they arrive they find him dead, survived by a daughter (Peggy Stewart). Lash knows that Conway (John Cason) is involved but that Conway is not the boss of the gang. Lash thinks he knows who it is, and sets a trap to flush him out. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
