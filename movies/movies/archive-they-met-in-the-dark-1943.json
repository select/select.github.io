      "description": "A Royal Navy Commander (James Mason) is court-martialed after losing some secret documents and vows to track down those responsible.  He meets a Canadian woman (Joyce Howard) when they independently stumble over a dead body, and the two of them end up exposing a network of Nazi spies and collaborators. Loosely based on Anthony Gilbert's novel \"The Vanished Corpse\" James Mason as Richard Francis Heritage Joyce Howard as Laura Verity Edward Rigby as Mansel Tom Walls as Christopher Child Phyllis Stanley as Lily Bernard Ronald Ward as Carter David Farrar as Commander Lippinscott Karel Stepanek as Riccardo Finlay Currie as Merchant Captain Patricia Medina as Mary, the manicurist I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
