      "description": "Blood & Oil (Oloibiri) - When commercial-grade oil was discovered in the small village of Oloibiri, Nigeria, prosperity and employment became their way of life.  Two decades after the last drops were drilled and the US oil companies abandoned them, all the village was left with was polluted water, sick children, and an unstable economy.  When a new multinational corporation strikes oil again, rage intensifies and Nigerian militants, led by a hardened killer named Gunpowder (Richard Mofe-Damijo), seek revenge on the greedy foreigners by kidnapping Powell, (William R. Moses) the company’s CEO.  Families become divided as the village elder, Timpriye (Olu Jacobs) struggles with saving the life of this man who represents all the evils that oil brought to his village so many years ago. \n2015.
