      "description": "A seemingly carefree young man named John (Reynaud Verley), released on probation from a sanitarium, visits his Aunt Marta (Viveca Lindfors) and three beautiful cousins. Gradually, through an escalating series of strange practical jokes, he sets a labyrinth plot of vengeance in motion. Director Claudio Guerin Hill - who tragically died on the last day of shooting ? and genre specialist, writer Santiago Moncada (HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON), deliver a deliciously chilling, darkly humorous masterpiece of Horror of disaffected youth driven to the brink of madness by the manipulative control of Family and the hypocrisy of society in general. There are disturbing parallels to not only alienated international youth culture of the time but also the dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco who ruled Spain until his death in 1975. This marriage of Grand Guignol Thriller and subtle, stinging social satire is supremely entreating and comparable to such masters Roman Polanski, Luis Bunel and Mario Bava.",
