      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of Gloria Swansons few box office successes in the sound era, this drama earned her a Best Actress nomination for her role. She would go on to lead five more talkies that would all flop, before coming back nearly twenty years later to star in Sunset Boulevard. The plot of The Trespasser is slightly convoluted, but it essentially follows a woman as she is repeatedly betrayed by the men in her life. ",
