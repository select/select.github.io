      "description": "In a flashback Mr. Magoo thinks back in time to the Gay 90's when he was a young man, and just as myopic then as in the 1950s. He makes a bet with a friend that he can get a date with a star of the Broadway stage. It isn't long before Stage-Door Johnny Magoo winds up on stage in the play during a dinner scene, and performs rather well considering he was hearing the dialogue for the first time. Later, he is firmly convinced he had taken the Police Gazette beauty to dinner. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/magoos-young-manhood-1958/",
