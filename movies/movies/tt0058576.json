      "description": "Believing his government's disarmament policy to be dangerous, a warmongering general staff officer attempts a coup against the US president. The impending nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union is averted by the loyalty of an upright major...  Set in 1974, this science fiction fantasy with political overtones builds on the fear of nuclear war circulating in the early 1960s. Dialogue-driven and rich in military-strategic speculation, the film attempts to banish irrational fears in Hollywood style and resolves the problems with a conventional happy ending. Unlike Kubrick's farce \"Dr. Strangelove,\" made the same year, it is a more soothing vision of the end times.",
