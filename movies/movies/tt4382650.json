    "Plot": "This inclusive documentary takes a unique look at the most influential West Coast rap group in history and inventors of gangster rap: NWA. The life and death of controversial rapper Eazy-E and the birth of the career of highly successful actor, movie producer and rapper Ice Cube and world renowned music producer Dr. Dre is documented through never-before-seen candid interviews, personal photos, and touching stories, giving insight into the real men behind the records. Eazy-E took America through the streets of Compton for an unforgettable ride, and created a new music style that spawned a billion dollar industry. This is the personal story of Compton boy Eric Wright, and his journey to becoming the King of Gangster Rap as a man who actually lived the criminal lifestyle he featured in his music. His legacy is captured here in the way Eazy-E and NWA changed the landscape of rap and hip hop forever.",
