      "description": "Near the end of the American Civil War, gold shipments destined for Washington from California are being hijacked by a gang of spies posing as Confederate soldiers, led by Alex Morel (Lionel Atwill) with his secret accomplice Trina Dessard (Virginia Christine). Union agent Steve Clark  (Dennis Moore) and his friend Idaho Jones (Joe Sawyer) go after them with the help of Cathy Haines (Wanda McKay), the shipping company agent. A 13-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
