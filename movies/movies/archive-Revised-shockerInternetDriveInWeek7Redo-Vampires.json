      "description": "Since it was decided that the \"Incredible Two Headed Transplant\" was copyrighted and my previous version of Week 7 was deleted, I took some advice and created a new presentation. This new feature is a mini vampire festival. It has \"Grave of the Vampire\" from my original Week 7, but I included a bunch of Hammer movie trailers for various Dracula flicks. So, this is not a double feature, just some trailers, a Bugs Bunny cartoon, some nifty advertisements and \"Grave of the Vampire\"! For those of you lucky enough to have downloaded the original Week 7, consider yourself blessed; and, the rest of you - enjoy our REVISED Shocker Internet Drive In Week 7 REDO. Confused? Don't sweat it - just visit http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/",
