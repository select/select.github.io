      "description": "Odds Against Tomorrow is a 1959 American film noir produced and directed by Robert Wise and starring Harry Belafonte , Robert Ryan and Ed Begley . Belafonte selected Abraham Polonsky to write the script, which is based on a novel of the same name by William P. McGivern . Blacklisted in those years, Polonsky had to use a front and John O. Killens was credited. Polonsky's screenwriting credit was restored in 1996 in his own name.",
