      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. In this early German film version of the Shakespeare play, Hamlet is born as a woman but must live as a man to be eligible to ascend to the throne. The picture was critically acclaimed, though there doesn't seem to be information remaining on whether it was a box office success.  The two video sources for this include one with English subtitles \"baked in\" to the video, and another that only includes the original German, but with worse quality. I have also included two soundtracks, with one being an improvised version that was sourced from \"Ashley Hribar\" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bPjlDwk_dc",
