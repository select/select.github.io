    "Plot": "April 4 1968 was a day that changed the landscape forever. The life of the most influential voice of social justice was ended. No person has transformed a race's social standing as Martin Luther King Jr. He transcended racial barriers, serving as the spokesman for non violence during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. But, the quest for equality came with consequences. The official account of Martin Luther King Jr's assassination points the finger solely at one long gunman. This documentary will challenge convention looking behind the scenes at who orchestrated and carried out the silencing of the most powerful voice of the 20th century. Was it the actions of a poor, crazed ex convict or...the working of a deeper conspiracy? Discover the concealed clues behind the assassination as we uncover the cover ups and follow the facts to find out, who killed MLK.",
