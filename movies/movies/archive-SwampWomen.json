      "description": "Roger Corman's Swamp Women has been kicking around in wretched quality for years, and I'm not sure this represents an \"upgrade,\" but it does have improved sound and color. Also, it's presented in 16 x 9 format; closer to the original theatrical aspect ratio. For all the tedious trudging through the swamp and over-the-top dialog, it's actually a well-made little programmer, with good acting by all concerned, a decent script, and Corman's nice moving camera, a feature which always sets him apart from other fast and furious directors. Look for a pre- Little Shop of Horrors cameo by Jonathan Haze as a pickpocket. With Marie Windsor, Beverly Garland, Carole Matthews, Touch (Mike) Connor's, and \"introducing\" Jil Jarmyn. From Wikipedia: Swamp Women  ( 1955 ) was one of the first films directed by  Roger Corman . This  adventure / crime / horror film  follows undercover police officer Lee Hampton who joins three female convicts and escapes from prison. The escape is part of a larger plot to uncover a cache of diamonds hidden deep within the swamps of  Louisiana . This film is sometimes also known as  Cruel Swamp  or  Swamp Diamonds . The film is now in the  public domain .",
