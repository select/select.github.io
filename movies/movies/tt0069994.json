When Charlotte arrives, however, she learns that Stephens has died in the interim, and that she'll be taking orders from new president Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams). Charlotte goes al ong, but can't help noticing how unusual Masters' approach is to treating the mentally ill. They're allowed free run of the place, and Charlotte begins to wonder if Masters isn't a patient herself.",

      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: The drive-in Theater became popular in rural areas during the 1940s and peaked in the late 1950s. With the competition of VCRs and video rental, by the 1970s attendance was in decline. To remain viable many venues switched from showing family-friendly fare to genre films appealing to teenagers. This independent horror movie directed by S. F. Brownrigg is a PizzaFLIX favorite and became a cult hit at the Drive-In 1973. \n\nStars: Bill McGhee, Jessie Lee Fulton, Robert Dracup\nDirector: S.F. Brownrigg\nWriter: Tim Pope\n\nWhen a young psychiatric nurse goes to work at a lonesome asylum, she experiences varying degrees of torment from the patients.",
