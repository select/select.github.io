      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: The drive-in Theater became popular in rural areas during the 1940s and peaked in the late 1950s. With the competition of VCRs and video rental, by the 1970s attendance was in decline. To remain viable many venues switched from showing family-friendly fare to genre films appealing to teenagers. This independent horror movie directed by S. F. Brownrigg is a PizzaFLIX favorite and became a cult hit at the Drive-In 1973. \n\nStars: Bill McGhee, Jessie Lee Fulton, Robert Dracup\nDirector: S.F. Brownrigg\nWriter: Tim Pope\n\nWhen a young psychiatric nurse goes to work at a lonesome asylum, she experiences varying degrees of torment from the patients.",
