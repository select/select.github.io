The young man finally comes to America, and secures employment as an unskilled laborer at the Gary works of the United States Steel Corporation. He works hard, attends night school, gradually learns the language and ways of the country, becomes a skilled laborer and marries. His happiness as the prosperous head of a family is shown, and also the interest which the great corporation takes of its employees and their willingness to advance those who are ambitious and competent. The many safety appliances which have been installed at great expense to prevent laborers from being injured are shown, and the new laborer is seen as he is instructed in his duties.",
