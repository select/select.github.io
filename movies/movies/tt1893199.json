    "Plot": "Here's an unusual Vitaphone short for the era. Bud Harris and Frank Radcliffe do a comic sequence about playing at dice; they wrangle about proper behavior at a dinner party; and they end by singing a song.The only thing that's remarkable about it is that both performers are Black. Doubtless it was thought this would be more popular in urban movie houses, and in the theaters that catered exclusively to Black audiences. Harris appeared in the poor roles that were available for Black movie actors in those days: railroad porters, the occasional witch doctor, then went behind the camera as a cinematographer on independent productions on the East Coast and television. Radcliffe seems to have fallen out of he records for a long time; he probably played in Black night clubs. He surfaced in 1951 on the Kate Smith Hour!",
