      "description": "THE MOLE PEOPLE (1956) colorized Archaeologists (John Agar & Hugh Beaumont) trace an artifact to a mountaintop temple where they discover a lost group of Sumerians trapped for 5000 years in a underground cave system beneath a glacier. They have evolved into albinos ruling a slave race of burrowing mole people. The high priest (Alan Napier) wants to kill the strangers, but a throwback with normal pigmentation (Cynthia Patrick) is attracted to them. John Agar as Dr. Roger Bentley Cynthia Patrick as Adel (Adad) Hugh Beaumont as Dr. Jud Bellamin Alan Napier as Elinu, the High Priest Nestor Paiva as Prof. Etienne Lafarge Phil Chambers as Dr. Paul Stuart I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
