      "description": "In 1867 , a convoy of 40 wagons full of whiskey and champagne is on its way from Julesburg to Denver. In inhospitable terrain, the group is chasing two cavalry units, dedicated anti-alcohol women's rights activists, and booze-hungry Native Americans.. A solid, often somewhat long-winded Western that offers varied entertainment through solid acting and numerous amusing parodic elements.. (Photographed using the \" Ultra-Panavision \" Cinerama process, impressive only in theaters; the original American version ran 167 minutes .)",
