      "description": "This transfer has much improved contrast and brightness plus it’s in the correct aspect ratio. “Most Enjoyable” “Fun in the old lighthouse” “Hilarious romp” “Safe for Askeyphobes” (IMDB reviews quotes). This is the movie most fans and critics agree is Arthur Askey’s best wartime comedy. The diminutive zany is backed by a fun cast that includes the adorable Vera Francis and a bevy of shipwrecked fashion models. What could possibly go right? IMDB rating 6.5. Directed by Herbert Mason. Released in 1942 (UK only). Complete print.",
