      "description": "Strike was directed in 1925 by Sergai Eisenstein. It was Esienstein's first feature film and an indicator of the brilliant films t follow. As with other Communist films of this period, the workers in general are the heroes. The composition and editing are spectacular, particularly with the scenes as the troop raid the apartment buildings, and the conclusion where the killing of the workers is intercut with the slaughter of cattle.",

When a worker hangs himself after being falsely accused of thievery, the workers strike. At first, there's excitement in workers' households and in public places as they develop their demands communally. Then, as the strike drags on and management rejects demands, hunger mounts, as does domestic and civic distress. Provocateurs recruited from the lumpen and in league with the police and the fire department bring problems to the workers; the spies do their dirty work; and, the military arrives to liquidate strikers.",
