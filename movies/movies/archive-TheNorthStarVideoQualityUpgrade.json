      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the existing IA copy, plus it is in the correct aspect ratio. A lavishly produced wartime propaganda epic with an all-star cast. Like the films \"Mission to Moscow\" and \"Song of Russia\" its purpose was to boost support for our Soviet ally. It opens as a lighthearted semi-musical, but then abruptly erupts in violence and stark tragedy as the Nazis attack and occupy a peaceful Ukrainian village. Corny at times, over the top at times, yet there is no denying this film's power. Directed by Lewis Milestone. Released in 1943 (see Special Note). Complete print. SPECIAL NOTE: \"The North Star\" is in the public domain. However in 1957 a drastically edited version with anti-soviet narration and added post war news footage was released under the title \"Armored Attack.\" This version is not in the public domain. (Info courtesy of Oldbones) CAST NOTE: This was Farley Granger's first film role.",
