Their first number, \"Come On, Baby!\", is an upbeat honky-tonk styled piece, featuring clarinet and trumpet solos. They move to a romantic ballad, \"Shame on You\", as their next number, which also features soloists, most notably a lead vocalist. They end their three song set with \"Milenberg Joys\", another upbeat number featuring two of the band members performing a vocal scat duet, one of whom ends up being his own one man band.",
