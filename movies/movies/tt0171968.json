      "description": "The Rajah's Casket A lush moorish or turkic-inspired set design & gorgeous costumes makes The Rajah's Casket a visual thrill. Sundry characters gather before the young rajah, presenting him with gifts, including a casket or treasure chest which is soon stolen by means of magic. A fakir is brought forth who does some sword & fire magic to help uncover the culprit who stole the treasure chest. The fakir leads the Rajah to a room with an enormous window, through which a horned djinn is seen flying by on a smoke-billowing wyvern, clutching the stolen casket. Investigating through a forboding ruin, the fakir & the rajah come upon the djinn's cavern. The rajah draws his sword & destroys the djinn. In the next chamber of the cavern they find the treasure chest, from which arises a beautiful queen dressed in gold & six dancing girls in green. They put on quite a colorful performance, showing a lot of thigh from under their long dresses. The treasure chest is brought to the rajah's palace where the rajah is enthroned with the queen, the maidens dance joyfully, & the vizier discovers the chest also has jewels within.",
