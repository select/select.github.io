    "Plot": "While this short mainly depicts two black kids screaming and running for their life in a haunted house-thereby reaffirming the \"blacks scared of spook\" stereotype-there are some good animation and nice humorous touches that redeems this short, The Old House, somewhat. This is the MGM Bosko and not the Warner Bros. one that looked like a little monkey (that remark may offend some people but it's true). Both though were created by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising so there was no copyright infringement involved. If what I just described doesn't appeal to you, by all means avoid. To anyone else interested in MGM animation pre-Tom and Jerry and Tex Avery, it's worth seeing at least once.",
