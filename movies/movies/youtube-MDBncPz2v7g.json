      "description": "Duchotel regularly deceives his wife Léontine into believing that he is going hunting. Doctor Moricet, friend of the couple and secretly in love with Léontine, opens her eyes and decides to take her to a meeting house while Monsieur hunts. It turns out that in the same house, on the same day, Duchotel makes perfect love with Madame Cassagne, his mistress and wife of a friend of the couple. Let us add to this that young Gontran is also on the scene having an appointment with a woman of the world. What follows is an incessant chase which will become even more complicated when the police commissioner intervenes at the request of Mr. Cassagne in order to establish a finding of adultery.\n\nColorized version: https://youtu.be/7BtaqX2h6ts\n\nOriginal title: Monsieur Chasse (1947)\n\n\nDirector:  Willy Rozier\nWriters: Georges Feydeau, Willy Rozier\nWith: Frederic Duvalles, Noelle Norman, Paul Meurisse, Félix Oudart\nGenre: French cinema, Comedy\n\n@CultCinemaClassics\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdaVNpTE5NfgyPqL-rKc8VsL",
