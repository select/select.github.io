      "description": "Hello and welcome back to the Drive-In that put \"fun\" into \"funny\" and tonight we have two waterlogged gems from 1980 that are guaranteed to scare up a laugh or two. First up, after some nifty coming attractions and a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we dive in with \"Monstroid: It Came From The Lake\" (aka \"Monster\"), featuring John Carradine and James Mitchum doing battle with the title creature down in Columbia. Then, following intermission, we finish up with \"Death Ship\", an ocean bound tale with George Kennedy and Richard Crenna trying to slow down a haunted Nazi freighter. Note: the film print for \"Death Ship\" is not the best. With all that water on the big screen, you best bring a towel so you can dry off afterwards.  NEW Facebook Address:  https://www.facebook.com/shockerdrivein.dx.am website: http://shockerdrivein.dx.am or http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com",
