      "description": "The Christianization of Hawaii at the beginning of the 19th century by New England Calvinists, portrayed through the fate of a zealous seeker of God who, in his blind fanaticism and excessive moral strictness, proclaims a threatening message instead of the good news.. A sprawling (partial) film adaptation of Michener's novel, staged with great technical effort as a perfect cinematic, but without any in-depth exploration of the issues..",
