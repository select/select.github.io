Roger Corman takes on the Spy, Gangster, and Monster genres and folds them into a big fishy Cubano. Secret Agent XK150 is played by Edward Wain, aka Robert Towne, who became one of Hollywood’s greatest screenwriters, known for The Last Detail, Shampoo, and Chinatown.\n\nTHE PUERTO RICO TRILOGY: In 1960, Roger Corman set sail for Puerto Rico incentivized by the tax breaks for filming on the sunny island. Two films were scheduled back-to-back: Battle of Blood Island and The Last Woman on Earth. Filming went so smoothly that Corman commissioned Charles Griffith to write a third, which was shot at the same time: Creature from the Haunted Sea🍕",
