Roger Corman takes on the Spy, Gangster, and Monster genres and folds them into a big fishy Cubano. Secret Agent XK150 is played by Edward Wain, aka Robert Towne, who became one of Hollywood’s greatest screenwriters, known for The Last Detail, Shampoo, and Chinatown.\n\nTHE PUERTO RICO TRILOGY: In 1960, Roger Corman set sail for Puerto Rico incentivized by the tax breaks for filming on the sunny island. Two films were scheduled back-to-back: Battle of Blood Island and The Last Woman on Earth. Filming went so smoothly that Corman commissioned Charles Griffith to write a third, which was shot at the same time: Creature from the Haunted Sea🍕",

      "description": "This is the 75 minute TV version of Roger Corman's (and Charles Griffin's) goofy self-parody \"Creature from the Haunted Sea.\" For television, Monte Hellman wrote, produced and directed about 15 minutes of new footage to get the film up to a marketable length including an absurd theme song as performed by the wonderful Betsy Jones-Moreland. These scenes, presumably shot in 16mm, were never intended for theatrical release, but crop to a 16 x 9 aspect ratio (along with the rest of the film) as though that had been a possibility. This is just about as good an image as you'll find on this title, but the beginning is a little rough.

That's right! We are happy to bring you another classic Corman double feature. First up, after some coming attractions from Roger and a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we proudly present 1961's \"Creature From The Haunted Sea\" - an off-beat comedy with one of the worst looking monsters ever committed to film stock. Then, after a brief intermission, we present 1959's \"The Wasp Woman\" - Corman's female answer to the fly (with a cameo from Roger himself!) As always we invite you to bring (almost) the whole family and don't forget to visit our snackbar for lots of great food, soda, popcorn and candy. Oh, and remember to turn right when you leave the good ol' Shocker Internet Drive In! NEW WEB ADDRESS: http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://www.shockerredirect.tk/",
