      "description": "Love Letters from the Middle East Kiomars Moradi and Porya Azarbayjani‘s devastating Love Letters from the Middle East by Sophie Kerman aislesaytwincities.com Some topics are so serious, so immediate, and so tragic that it is better to deny audiences the catharsis they often seek at the theater. This is the case with Kiomars Moradi and Porya Azarbayjani ‘s devastating Love Letters from the Middle East , a trio of monologues about the plight of women affected by the upheaval in Afghanistan and Iraq.
