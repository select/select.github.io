They're given cards saying: \"Join The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps\" and they run to the barracks for military training. When Hank comes home and finds that all the chickens - including his 4 wives - disappeared, he's shocked. After reading the letter his 4 wives left him about joining the WAAC and to take care of the chicks, he is furious. He sees everyone in WAAC uniforms and tries to tell them to come back, but to no avail. When all the chicks hatch at the same time and try to sit under his behind, Hank ends up flying in the air. Thankfully, when cats arrive, he protects his chicks. The cats \"kidnap\" Hank and the chicks, and the WAAC soldiers arrive in vehicles with machine guns. They stop the cats, and after they swim, they find their tails are gone. The soldiers have the cats' tails tied to their vehicles and Hank congratulates and thanks them. An ambulance arrives and Hank is places in it and when it leaves, Hank falls out covered in bandages, and his chicks surround him.",
