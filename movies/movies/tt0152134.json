    "Plot": "This time, at least, Mighty Mouse gets to beat up on vultures, who attack baby bunnies like a squadron of Stukas in this almost bearable Terrytoon.The release date and the presence of rabbits makes me think this was intended for the Easter season. Other than that and the usual saccharine MM attitudes, there isn't much to comment on. Of course, vultures aren't predators, but scavengers, but the target audience for the series would not understand that distinction, nor care.The staff tries to put in a couple of gags, like making the vultures Indians, complete with war drums, but the series had already descended into a rote exercise, with the animals cheering with exactly the same sound effect twice -- once at the birth of the bunnies and the other after MM has beaten up the bad guys. Perhaps you have fond enough memories of MM from your childhood to make this one worth watching again. I don't.",
