      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Russian historical crime drama follows a grifter around the time of the 1825 Decembrist revolt. He wins a ring with the initials \"S.V.D.\" in a gamble, and constantly reinvents the meaning of the initials to get himself out of trouble. How long can he get away with it? Contemporary reviews and box office returns do not seem to have been recorded for the film, but modern viewers are enchanted by the setting and directing.  The picture of this  is messy and seems to have been recorded from a TV airing in the 1990's. The soundtrack was in even worse shape, though I took the opportunity to clean it to the point where it was usable. The download includes an English subtitle track. ",
