Harry's chance to prove himself comes with an \"engineering\" job with the city. But it's sanitary engineering, and while our street sweeping hero tries his best, he just can't avoid making enemies. When he stumbles into the midst of a lively Chinatown tong war, it's Harry's bravery that saves Natalie and wins the day.",
