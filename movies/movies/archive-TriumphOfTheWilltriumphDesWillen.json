      "description": "This is the documentary which chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. It was directed by Leni Riefenstahl who had the full support of the Nazi party and is a brilliant but frightening picture of the power of fascism. While it is available elsewhere on the archive it is there only in FLV format. I have uploaded it in MP4 to make it available to many more viewers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will",
