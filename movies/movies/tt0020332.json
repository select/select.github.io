      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This musical comedy starring Bebe Daniels and John Boles was also the first film appearance of the comedy duo Wheeler & Woolsey. The finale of the film has an extended color sequence and the film ended up as a large box-office success. Unfortunately five reels of the film are believed to be lost, so the edited and cut version is all that remains.",
