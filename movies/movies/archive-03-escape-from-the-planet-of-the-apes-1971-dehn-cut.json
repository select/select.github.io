      "description": "Escape from the Planet of the Apes without the tacked on baby Milo ending. The ending was filmed really poorly with editing loops to make a chimpanzee appear to be saying \"Mama\" which unironically looks more akin to something out of The Monkees TV series than a feature film.  This edit tries to keep the same dark tone as screenwriter Paul Dehn's other endings to the Planet of the Apes series (Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes - Director's Cut).  Jerry Goldsmiths music piece which is just called (Final Chapter + End Credits)  synced up perfectly when removing the baby Milo scene which makes me assume that the baby Milo scene was tacked on by the studio because the ending would be pretty dour for audiences, but it just seems more fitting.  HD HEVC 1918x812 (2.35) English Audio 2.0 AAC English Subtitles SRT The original theatrical ending is included for reference. ",
