Julie soon decides to adopt the child so that her husband Bill will not be alone when she dies. After Julie dies, Bill is so grief stricken, he shuts out everyone in his life, even Hitty. Hitty believes she's receiving visits from Julie who offers Hitty advice on how to make Bill happy. Unfortunately, Bill is not charmed by Hitty's efforts to care for him; he does not believe she's seen Julie and wants to send her to boarding school.
