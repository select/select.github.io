      "description": "It was the year in which the Action Committee of Democratic Progress should unite the varios political left groups and be elected in the German parliament. The question of social property was the focus. Roland Hehn and Rainer Boldt from the Film and Television Academy Berlin, \"stole\"for us the film material and provided the recording devices. Norbert Stratmann was actor and provocateur for our call to establish social peace and, if necessary take illegal action, without getting caught.
