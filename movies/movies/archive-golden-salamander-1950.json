      "description": "A British archaeologist comes to Tunisia to catalog a collection of art relics and stumbles into evidence of a gun-smuggling racket. Hesitant at first to get involved or even to report the information, he becomes convinced he must do the right thing after a young man is murdered. By then, though, the smugglers are aware that he knows too much and they target him for death. Based on the novel by Victor Canning. Trevor Howard as David Redfern Anouk Aimée as Anna Herbert Lom as Rankl Wilfrid Hyde-White as Agno Walter Rilla as Serafis Miles Malleson as Douvet Jacques Sernas as Max If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
