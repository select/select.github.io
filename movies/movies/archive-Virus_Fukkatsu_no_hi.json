      "description": "NOTE: THIS FILM IS SEPARATED INTO 7 FILES. Virus (復活の日, Fukkatsu no hi) is an 1980 film directed by Kinji Fukasaku. The film is in public domain, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_%281980_film%29. Most of the film is in English but for the Japanese scenes, subtitles are present on subtitle 'Track1' (VLC), not burned in, note: you have to turn subtitles on, they are not defaulted. All files were ripped directly and not reformatted, '.vob' extensions merely changed to '.mpg', otherwise files are as they appear on disc. Files not included from the DVD are copyrighted menus and distributor intro logos. DVD ripped from is BCI Cat.No. 47207-9-1, region 1. Another version is uploaded on archive.org, http://www.archive.org/details/cco_virus, it is pan and scanned, whereas this version is widescreen, and slightly windowboxed. It also appears to be a different edit.
