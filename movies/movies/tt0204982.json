    "Plot": "Four stories with four boys with similar characters, hard to find in real life, courage, spirit of sacrifice, love of people, morality of angels. All four young actors are convincing. The fourth episode, the one with the boy who takes care of his father who is very ill in the hospital, is also the best. Chris Avram, without speaking much, is very good in double role, the real father and the man who the boy thought that was his father.",
