      "description": "This all-black drama of Harlem life in the late '40s was released toward the end of the race film era. The end of double feature continous performance programs and the resulting death of B-features killed off more than just the white poverty row studios. This film's production values are very primative and well below the standards set by many race films of the late '30s and early '40s. Written and directed by Powell Lindsay. Released in 1949. Complete print.",
