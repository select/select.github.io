Janie, however, has been losing racing bets placed with Lem Woodruff, proprietor of the boardinghouse where she and Mayme live; and to make up her losses, she places the pageant money on a winning horse, but inadvertently the bet is placed on another horse. She confesses her predicament to Mayme, who wins back the money by shooting craps with Lem. Janie blames her sister for the loss until Mayme shows up with the money and vents her righteous wrath on her hypocritical sister. Bill returns to Mayme, and Janie finds happiness with Jim, a fellow boarder.",
