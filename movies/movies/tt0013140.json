      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Erich Von Stroheim's third picture, Foolish Wives was a commercial flop that had been trimmed down by the studio from over six hours down to under two. It was billed as the first film to ever cost more than a million dollars to make. This version uses some antique footage to try and restore the picture closer to the original cut.
