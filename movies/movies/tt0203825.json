He is ambushed outside of town by Jerry Blake (Gene Alsace), a man he once sent to prison, and kills him in the ensuing gunfight. Red finds a note on Blake that introduces him to man called Deke. The gunfight is witnessed by Tommy Lord (Hal Taliaferro) and his girlfriend, Sue Callahan ('Lucille Lund), whose father, Wade Callahan (Lafe McKee),has been a victim of the rustlers. Sue rides for the sheriff, Curt Turner (Slim Whitaker). It turns out that the sheriff and his ten-man posse comprise most of the members of the rustling gang and have no intentions of allowing Reb to leave the area with his life intact.",
