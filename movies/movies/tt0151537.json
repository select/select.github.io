    "Plot": "This has got to be one of the worst Van Beuren cartoons I have seen--and that's saying a lot. It consists of three ultra-cutesy kittens annoying a dog. Considering how cutesy the cats were and how annoying they were and that they sang, I really wanted to see the dog rip them to pieces (and don't email me--I own dogs AND cats and love my cats...but not these annoyingly saccharine ones in the cartoon). Most of the time the cats just prance about acting cute until ultimately they get squirted with seltzer. Crap like this is exactly why most folks today have never heard of Van Beuren and why television stations never show these shorts. Poorly written and not the least bit entertaining from start to finish.",
