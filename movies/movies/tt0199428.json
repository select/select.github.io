The inexperienced country girl, flattered by the attention of the showman, joins him and they arrange to elope. Lazelle, the sweetheart of Burke, overhears the conversation and tells John, Mary's suitor, of the proposed elopement. John goes to warn Mary's parents but finds they have gone to the fair. Running down the road, John meets Mary's father and mother on the way back from the fair. He tells them of Mary's proposed elopement and states that a strange buggy has just driven down the road toward the depot. A wild ride toward the railroad station takes place and Mary's parents arrive just as the young girl is about to board the train. The error she is about to make is impressed upon Mary and she agrees to return home. Just as the train is pulling out, Burke arrives and seeing his plans have been frustrated, he boards the last car. Realizing her fortunate escape, Mary concludes John is a safer companion than a traveling showman.",
