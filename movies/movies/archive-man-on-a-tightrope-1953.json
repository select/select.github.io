      "description": "You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia.This article from the New York Times may also still be active.  Man on a Tightrope is a 1953 American Film Noir directed by Elia Kazan, starring Fredric March, Terry Moore and Gloria Grahame. The screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood is based on a 1952 novel of the same title by Neil Paterson.  Based on the true story of a Czech circus troupe's daring attempt to escape to the West, the film is energized by Kazan's extensive location shooting in Eastern Europe, the casting of members from the real life troupe, and a steely performance by Frederic March as the harried circus leader dreaming of a better life. The movie was entered into the 3rd Berlin International Film Festival.",
