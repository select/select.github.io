      "description": "Egotistic theatrical producer Matt Saxon (Robert Montgomery) decides to produce a play by novelist Eric Busch (John Payne) with backing by a millionaire. When Eric and his wife, Janet (Susan Hayward), dine with Matt and his girlfriend, singer Alma Wragg, she warns them that Matt has a reputation of ruining everything that he touches. When Matt involves himself with Eric's rewrites, Alma's tryout for a club, and even Eric and Janet's vacation, Alma's warning proves awfully prescient.",
