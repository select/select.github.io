      "description": "Egotistic theatrical producer Matt Saxon (Robert Montgomery) decides to produce a play by novelist Eric Busch (John Payne) with backing by a millionaire. When Eric and his wife, Janet (Susan Hayward), dine with Matt and his girlfriend, singer Alma Wragg, she warns them that Matt has a reputation of ruining everything that he touches. When Matt involves himself with Eric's rewrites, Alma's tryout for a club, and even Eric and Janet's vacation, Alma's warning proves awfully prescient.",

The actor then comes to New York and offers to do the play, if someone other than Saxon is the producer.",
