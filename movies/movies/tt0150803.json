    "Plot": "Krazy Kat runs a gymnasium where out-of0shape filks go through the slimming and fit routines of the era, usually involving machinery or high-pressure steam. In Krazy's gym, of course, a lot of these services are provided by animals: an octopus -- albeit one with only six arms, this is a cartoon after all -- might give one the pummelin a msseur would offer. After three minutes of this, there's enough gags, time for the plot, such as it is, to kick in.That pretty much sums of this cartoon, as it does all too many, not to mention comedy features: a great start, and then the plot, and who cares?",
