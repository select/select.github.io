      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Navy Blues is a rarely remembered romantic comedy starring William Haines and Anita Page. Reviews at the time were tepid and the box office was weak, but it still served as a launching point for William Haines between silent and talking films.",
