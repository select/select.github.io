    "Plot": "Men carrying a New Year's dragon rush past strollers, including several Europeans in this late Lumiere short.I've seen similar dragons in New York City. Head into Chinatown on Chinese New Year, and you may see it yourself, a long shimmer of brightly colored cloth held aloft, with the fellows carrying the dragon's head proudly leading the charge. Go into some of the better Chinese restaurants and you may see the dragon draped about the room, and hear the staff beating a drum. That's meant to drive away the demons. I've walked into a restaurant in a poor mood, heard the drums, and cheered up, so I can attest that it works.This was near the end of the Lumiere's period. When the movies had begun, they had led by being early to the cinema, by bringing their knowledge of composition from still photography, and understanding how competing lines of motion work. They had not, however, advanced much, and would sell out their catalogue a couple of years after this short.",
