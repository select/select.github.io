    "Plot": "A later Vitaphone film, this Warner Brothers short apparently was one created using a very complicated system through which an accompanying record was synchronized with a movie camera. There were several serious setbacks for such a system (such as if a film skipped--it became out of sync for the rest of the film plus the records quickly wore out--and 20 showings was the normal life-span of the records) and even though it produced excellent sound, it was eventually replaced. The last of the Vitaphone films records with were made in 1930, then the studio switched to the standard sound-on-film system.In this installment in the series of shorts, band leader Red Nichols and his orchestra perform several musical numbers that sound as if they were inspired by Dixieland Jazz. The music was peppy and strongly emphasized his excellent cornet playing. In addition, for one song Eddie Condon sang. All in all, a very typical and pleasant short from Warner Brothers/Vitaphone.",
