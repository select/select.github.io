      "description": "aka \"Dementia\". Could have been called \"Alice in Film-noirland\" A very dreamlike story indeed. Not so far from \"Carnival of Souls\" or Orson Welles' \"Trial\". John Parker was only the producer. Co-star Bruno VeSota is suspected to have been the real author of this treat. more info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047976/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughter_of_Horror",
