      "description": "Local ranchers send for Lash Larue after Taggart (Marshall Reed) closes off their water supply. Learning about this, Taggart sends his gang to kill Lash, but they get the wrong man. When Lash and his sidekick \"Fuzzy\" Jones set out to bring Taggart in, they learn Taggart not only controls the town but has also appointed himself sheriff. Directed by Ray Taylor I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
