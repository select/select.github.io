      "description": "The Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, is the subject of an epic war film, outstanding in its elaborate production and camerawork. Despite its superb attention to detail, the film offers more of a high-profile performance than it contributes to the historical clarification of the events. From a humanitarian perspective, the film offers little emotional connection.",
