      "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: A much sharper and cleaner print in the original theatrical release format is now available here: https://archive.org/details/TheGiantGilaMonsterWidescreenQualityUpgrade Late '50s teen exploitation Texas style. It's all here - a prejudicial adult figure, a misunderstood young hero who sings and builds hot rods, and of course mediocre rock 'n' roll. The Gila Monster (heloderma suspectum) adds local color, and some might think comedy relief. Filmed in and around Cielo, Texas. Released in 1959.",
