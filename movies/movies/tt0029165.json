    "Plot": "When a crafty reporter uses false pretenses to get a story out of heiress Tony Gateson, she turns the tables on him, telling the press that she's engaged to him and that she's given him a million dollar dowry. Suddenly he's on the front page and every salesman is at his doorstep. He loses his job and a day later asks her to call off the ruse; she tricks him again and the publicity continues. She stays cheerful and resourceful through a series of misadventures that has him alternately back on his job and fired. Meanwhile, a count who's her ex-fiancé shows up in New York, and maybe that marriage is back on. Can an heiress be a human being, and can a reporter get a scoop?",
