    "Plot": "This marriage is the second for both Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius McNitt. His social-climbing second wife has recruited Clifford Figfield to stage and direct a charity pageant, which is more a means for her to hobnob with the social elite, and to nab Larry Lodge, the pageant's leading man, as a husband for her flighty daughter Phyllis, the pageant's leading lady. Larry ends up having eyes only for Sally McNitt, Mr. McNitt's visiting daughter, and she, in turn is interested in him. Some misunderstandings on Larry's part - he ends up believing that Sally is the household maid, and that she and Mr. McNitt are having an affair - and Mrs. McNitt;s attempt to maneuver Sally out of the way may prevent a Sally/Larry happy ending. But Phyllis's coming to a decision of her own and Mr. McNitt's looking out for the welfare of his daughter may throw wrenches into the proceedings.",
