      "description": "In “Snow” Omid, a soldier-in-training, reunites with his family while on leave from service. The happy reunion is short-lived, however, as he discovers that his once-affluent and reputed family is crumbling under the pressure of the 2008 financial crisis, while the matriarch (played by Roya Teymurian) tries to hold the family together. “Snow” has previously been shown at Shanghai, Mumbai and, recently, São Paulo.",
