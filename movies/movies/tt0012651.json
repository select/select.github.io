      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the earliest surviving films by acclaimed director F.W. Murnau, The Haunted Castle is a much more basic film that what he would later create. Still, this mystery motion picture has atmosphere and beautiful sets. The name definitely feels like a misnomer, as it is not a horror film, but instead a mystery. ",
