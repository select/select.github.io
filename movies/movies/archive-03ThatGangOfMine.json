      "description": "That Gang of Mine  is a 1940 film and the third film in the  East Side Kids  series. Still no Huntz Hall, but Bobby Jordan is an asset. The familiar faces of Leo Gorcey and Sunshine Sammy Morrison are here, and there's another appearance from Dave \"Reefer Madness\" O'Brien. The director was Joseph H. Lewis, who later directed the archetypal noirs , \"Gun Crazy\" and \"The Big Combo.\" Hopefully this file represents an upgrade in quality over other Internet Archive versions.",
