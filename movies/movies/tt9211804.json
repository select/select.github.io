      "description": "“Simple, direct and gritty” “Impressive B-team effort” “Fun little detective story” (IMDB reviews quotes). An independently produced Mike Hammer adventure with tough guys and hot babes. Okay cast and adequate production with interesting views of late-fifties LA. It’s not quite film noir, but it is eminently watchable. IMDB rating 6.1. Directed by Victor Saville & George White. Releases in 1957. Complete print. ",
