      "description": "Welcome back to \"Shocker Internet Drive In\", reliving the great old days of warm summer nights, popcorn, bad movies and backseat love. Tonight we present a great Frankenstein double feature. After a rare (\"racist\") Bugs Bunny cartoon, we present that Italian trash classic \"Lady Frankenstein\" (parental discreation is advised) followed by the equally crazy \"Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter\"! Of course, as always, our feature includes the usual movie previews and drive-in advertisements. For more information, don't forget to visit our website:  Movie Website: http://shockerdrivein.dx.am or http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com Facebook Address:  https://www.facebook.com/shockerdrivein.dx.am",
