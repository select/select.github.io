However, instead of going to the TV studio, Magoo instead goes into a dentist's office. When it's his turn, Magoo breaks into a softshoe and the dentist realizes Magoo must be mistaken and leads him out the back door where various passersby are impressed with Magoo's act throwing him money. Magoo returns home with the money convinced he won first place on the show!",
