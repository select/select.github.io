      "description": "Very special and wonderful film footage of the beautiful island of Cuba and its capital Havana. This raw 35mm footage was probably shot for the purpose of being used in a movie or in a documentary. It shows Cuba while it was the Republic of Cuba. Although the exact date of filming is unknown, it was probably shot before the Cuban revolution which eventually lead to this country becoming a communist state in 1953. The Cuban Revolution was an armed revolt conducted by Fidel Castro's revolutionary \"26th of July Movement\"and its allies against the military dictatorship of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution began in July 1953 and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 31 December 1958, replacing his government. The 26th of July 1953 is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution (Dia de la Revolución). The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist–Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965 [Wiki]. The original 35mm film footage has been motion-stabilized, slightly speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of modern A.I. software. Source: archive.org. Music: Various, Cuban style, by contemporary composers.",
