      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The third film for comedy duo Wheeler and Woolsey, this film followed insurance salesmen help an attractive woman to fix her run down hotel. Unfortunately, some local gangsters wanted it to stay in ruins. This film was one of the biggest box office hits for RKO studios in 1930, though critically the film doesn't seem to have made much of an impact.",
