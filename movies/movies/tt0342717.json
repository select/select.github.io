    "Plot": "The Joy Road Project consists of a movie and an App. The movie Joy Road is about an upwardly mobile lawyer who gets drawn into helping his sister but then finds himself a pawn in a conspiracy to pass laws that fill up prisons. Truth being stranger than fiction, we found the real life counterpart to our fictional conspiracy here in America. The prison industrial complex, Arizona immigration law and Wisconsin Union busting laws are but a few of its accomplishments. So, to promote the film, we designed an APP to allow people to have a voice against this vast conspiracy. Using social media, we hope to be a film project, encased in and released with software that both tells a story and provides the tools for activism.",
