      "description": "A young secretary (Carol Marsh) comes to well-known private detective Richard Rollinson (John Bentley), worried that her employer has not shown up for work for several days. Rollinson breaks into the man's flat and finds a dead body, but not that of the missing man! To solve the mystery, Rollinson uses his friends and contacts in all echelons of society from the wealthy West End to the lowest East End, proving once again his fearsome reputation of always catching the bad guy. Long thought to be lost, the film was recovered and restored by Renown Pictures in 2013. Adapted by John Creasey from his novel, the 6th in his series of almost 60 novels about the Toff. John Bentley as The Honourable Richard Rollison AKA \"The Toff\" Carol Marsh as Fay Gretton Valentine Dyall as Inspector Grice Shelagh Fraser as Myra Lorne June Elvin as Lady Anthea Arthur Hill as Ted Harrison Michael Golden as Benny Kless If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
