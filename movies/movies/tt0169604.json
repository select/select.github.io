      "description": "A 19th-century French peasant girl insists that she has experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary. Once this sighting becomes common knowledge, Bernadette’s very existence becomes a religious and political hot potato. Thousands of people flock to the grotto at Lourdes where Bernadette claims she has seen the Holy Mother, believing that the waters therein contain recuperative powers. Bernadette dies under a cloud of controversy, but is ultimately elevated to sainthood by the Vatican. \n\nColorized version https://youtu.be/0_trSrXF7CI\nOriginal title: Il suffit d'aimer (1961)\nDirector: Robert Darène\nWriter: Gilbert Cesbron\nStars: Danièle Ajoret, Bernard Lajarrige, Madeleine Sologne",
