      "title": "The Rage of Paris (1938) | Colorized Public Domain Comedy | Danielle Darrieux & Douglas Fairbanks Jr",
      "description": "The Rage of Paris (1938) is a sparkling romantic comedy directed by Henry Koster and starring French actress Danielle Darrieux alongside Douglas Fairbanks Jr. This colorized and restored public domain classic captures the wit, charm, and elegance of late 1930s Hollywood romantic comedies. Produced by Universal Pictures, the film combines sophistication, mistaken identity, and screwball humor in a transatlantic love story between Paris and New York. Colorized Public Domain presents this cinematic gem in vivid color, breathing new life into a film that epitomizes Golden Age glamour and comedic timing.\n\nPlot Summary:\nNicole de Cortillon (Danielle Darrieux) is a stunning but penniless French model living in New York who dreams of wealth and romance. With the help of her scheming friend Gloria (Helen Broderick) and the loyal butler Guy (Mischa Auer), she concocts a daring plan to marry a rich American bachelor. Her target is the charming and wealthy Jim Trevor (Louis Hayward), but there is a twist—his best friend Jim (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) knows all too well how gold-diggers operate. Determined to expose Nicole’s deception, he pretends to fall for her himself, setting off a battle of wits, flirtation, and misunderstanding that spirals into genuine affection.\n\nAs their charade unfolds, Nicole’s sincerity begins to surface, and the film explores the tension between ambition and authenticity. The comic timing, snappy dialogue, and sparkling chemistry between Darrieux and Fairbanks make The Rage of Paris a delightful snapshot of late-Depression-era optimism and charm.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: Henry Koster\n• Producer: Bruce Manning\n• Screenplay: Bruce Manning and Felix Jackson\n• Cinematography: Rudolph Maté\n• Editing: Ted J. Kent\n• Music: Charles Previn\nStarring:\n• Danielle Darrieux as Nicole de Cortillon\n• Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Jim Trevor\n• Helen Broderick as Gloria Patterson\n• Mischa Auer as Guy\n• Louis Hayward as Bill Duncan\n• Samuel S. Hinds as Mr. Trevor\n• Fanny Brice as Hotel Manager\n• Edward Everett Horton as the Butler\n\nFilm Significance:\nThe Rage of Paris stands as a prime example of Hollywood’s ability to blend European sophistication with American comedic rhythm. Danielle Darrieux, already a celebrated star in France, made a dazzling Hollywood debut that established her international charm. Henry Koster’s direction ensures brisk pacing, while Rudolph Maté’s cinematography adds elegance and polish. The film’s romantic tension and glamorous settings influenced later Hollywood romantic comedies in the 1940s and beyond. For modern audiences, it’s a window into how pre-war cinema balanced humor, gender roles, and social aspiration with style and intelligence.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
