      "description": "Interesting old film footage about the city of Middelburg in the Netherlands, nearly a century ago. Middelburg is a town in the province Zeeland of The Netherlands. Zeelands consists of a number of large islands. Due to frequent flooding, especially in 1953, the Dutch government decided in the sixties to close-off the sea arms that connect to the North Sea. The so-called \"Deltaplan\" was executed consisting of the construction of a number of dams and sea locks. Middelburg is the main town on the island of Walcheren and is the largest town in the province Zeeland. This film has been restored, enhanced and colorized by means of state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence software. Bron ongerestaureerde Z/W film: Beeld en Geluid The nice music (titled \"Memories\") is kindly provided by the Belgian pianist Franco Di Nitto",
