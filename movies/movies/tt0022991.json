      "description": "\"Hell's House\" is a 1932 American drama film directed by Howard Higgin. The screenplay by Paul Gangelin and B. Harrison Orkow, set during the waning days of the Prohibition era, is based on a story by Higgin.\n\nWhen orphaned Jimmy Mason is taken in by his Aunt Emma and Uncle Henry, he meets their boarder Matt Kelly, who impresses the young man with his boastful swagger and alleged political connections, although in reality he's a bootlegger. The boy's life is disrupted when, as one of Kelly's hired hands, he refuses to identify his boss during a police raid and is sentenced to three years of hard labor in reform school, where he befriends a sickly boy named Shorty, who eventually is sent to solitary confinement.\n\nWhen Jimmy realizes his new pal is seriously ill and desperately needs medical attention, he escapes and goes to Kelly and Kelly's girl friend, Peggy Gardner, for help. Peggy contacts newspaper columnist Frank Gebhardt, who is anxious to expose the conditions at the state industrial school. The authorities find Jimmy at Gebhardt's office, but before they can apprehend him Kelly admits his involvement in the bootlegging operation and the boy is set free. He discovers Shorty has died, victimized by a corrupt system.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Howard Higgin, produced by B. F. Zeidman, written by Paul Gangelin and B. Harrison Orkow, starring Bette Davis as Peggy Gardner, Pat O'Brien as Matt Kelly, Junior Durkin as Jimmy Mason, Frank Coghlan Jr. as Shorty, Emma Dunn as Emma Clark, Charley Grapewin as Henry Clark, Morgan Wallace as Frank Gebhardt, Hooper Atchley as Captain Of The Guard, Wallis Clark as Judge Robinson and James A. Marcus as Superintendent Charles Thompson. \n\n---\n\nSource: \"Hell's House\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.. 1 March 2013.
