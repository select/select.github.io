In this film you will be taken back to the beginning of World War II when the Germans launched a vicious attack on the Netherlands in May 1940. The film focuses on the eventful days whereby the country prepares for war, Rotterdam is bombed to the ground, the Dutch government capitulates and the Germans take over the control of the country. It also shows scenes of daily life during the occupation as well as footage about the NSB party.",
