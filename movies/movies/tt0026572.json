      "description": "“Earnest political allegory” “One of the best” “Charismatic Conrad steals the show” (IMDB reviews quotes). A prison drama with political overtones in which Conrad Veidt leads a rebellion against a cruel warden. Good Anglo-Germen-American cast and good production values. Unfortunately they the weren’t enough. Its financial failure was Gaumont's death knell as an independent British production company. IMDB rating 6.2. Walter Forde. Released in 1935. Complete print but with marginal image quality.",
