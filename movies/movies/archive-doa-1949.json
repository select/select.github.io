      "description": "A small-town accountant goes to San Francisco to have one last binge before settling down with fiancée Paula. After a night on the town, he wakes up with more than just a hangover. Doctors tell him he's been given a \"luminous toxin\" with no antidote and has, at most, one week to live! He embarks on a frantic odyssey to retrace his steps to find out who poisoned him and why. Edmond O'Brien as Frank Bigelow Pamela Britton as Paula Gibson Luther Adler as Majak Beverly Garland as Miss Foster Lynn Baggett as Mrs. Philips William Ching as Halliday Henry Hart as Stanley Philips Neville Brand as Chester Laurette Luez as Marla Rakubian I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
