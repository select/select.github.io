    "Plot": "On a large wooden billboard crammed with colourful posters of all sorts, a vacant empty space is reserved in the middle. Before long, a worker plasters a beautiful advertisement of a well-dressed Parisian lady--and as a pair of cheerful police officers pass by--a miracle happens and the inanimate characters come to life. But, what kind of powerful magic would revive the lifeless images? And what will happen now that they have tasted the sweet air of freedom?",
