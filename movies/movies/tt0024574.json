      "description": "“Brilliant Lubitsch-like comedy” “Novello, Carroll and Hammond shine” “Carroll and Novello don’t get much sleep” (IMDB reviews quotes).   Ivor Novello is a sleeping car porter Don Juan with a paramour at every station in this fast-moving romantic comedy which puts the lie to claims that the pre-war British were stuffy. Madeleine Carroll is his costar and worthy foil. Good supporting cast and good production values. Definitely recommended. IMDB rating 7.6.   Directed by Anatole Litvak. Released in 1933 (UK only). Complete print (PAL transfer). AKA “Love and Let Love”",
