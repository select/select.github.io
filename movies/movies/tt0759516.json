    "Plot": "For any good comedy, you generally need at least two things to set the story in motion. In this case, you have a dog and you have a sausage. The dog wants the sausage. Others want to keep the dog from the sausage. There are any number of ways this could go. However, since the dog gets the sausage at the very beginning, it means that we have a chase. THE RACE FOR THE SAUSAGE, then, is a race against the dog. Guess who wins?",
