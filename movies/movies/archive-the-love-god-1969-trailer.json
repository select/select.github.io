      "description": "The Love God? is a 1969 Universal Pictures feature film which starred Don Knotts and Edmond O'Brien. It was written and directed by Nat Hiken,[1] who died between the completion of shooting and the film's release in theaters. The Love God?' marked a change of pace for Knotts, who up to then had exclusively appeared in G-rated family comedies, and it was an attempt to integrate Knotts into the type of adult-related films that dominated the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
