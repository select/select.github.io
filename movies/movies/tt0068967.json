      "description": "This Is a slightly remastered version i made myself. The movie has more color in it, and the sound has been upgraded a bit. Please note that this movie was uploaded in a video size of 320x240, so it wont look as good as it should if you watch it with the player that's here on the archive. Their player wont re- size to the 320x240 frame size. To see it in its full quality, download the cinepak version,which is the original AVI file i uploaded. That version looks really good to me. Some people may feel its got too much extra color, but you can always lower your color slide bar if you feel its too colorful.",
