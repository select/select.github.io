    "Plot": "Traveling through the countryside, a fox rests alongside a tree for a picnic. A nearby crow, however, tries to steal his food but is discovered by the fox and given a hotfoot. Reading from \"Eslop's Fables\" that foxes love grapes, he offers a vine of grapes to the fox but only if he will give up his picnic lunch in exchange for them. The fox figures that he can just get them himself. First, he tries jumping but, naturally, misses. Next, he tries pole-vaulting but crash-lands. Then, he tries propelling himself on a teeter-totter with a rock, but it lands on his head. Finally, he tries using a tree catapult that thrashes him from side to side. At this point, the fox admits defeat and gives the crow his lunch, only to be called a sucker. In the end, however, the fox is finally able to get the grapes, only to discover that they are sour grapes!",
