      "description": "A surgeon (it is always a surgeon) accidentally kills his soon to be ex-wife by pushing her over on to a plant sculpture with surprisingly sharp petals. Soon he is being blackmailed. Typical of Italian giallo there are a lot of scenes of people walking around, driving cars, lurking in dark alleys. English subtitles included",
