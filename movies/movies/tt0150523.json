    "Plot": "In this, the initial animated version of comic strip artist Otto Soglow's \"The Little King\", there's an outsider who seems to want to cause nothing but destruction in the palace but the childlike monarch and his dog do nothing but mischief on him. Loved the dolly on the round set of stairs that I remember from a later Van Beuren \"Little King\" cartoon called Pals (or Christmas Night which became the title for a later home movie issued version). Pretty amusing, if not hilarious short for King Features' mostly mute character. Recommend for animation fans of '30s talkie cartoons. I saw this on YouTube as linked from Matinée at the Bijou.",
