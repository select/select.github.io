      "description": "PUT OUT THE LIGHTS! The 2am Theater presents two classic old dark house mysteries as part of another simulated double feature program at a second-run movie house in the ‘30s. The dark nights and darker deeds begin with coming attractions and a Betty Boop cartoon. Followed by mystery, horror and an unstoppable killer in Mary Roberts Rinehart’s “The Bat Whispers.” Then was there a murder during the dark and stormy night or was it an elaborate hoax?  The shocking answer is revealed in “The Ghost Walks.”",
