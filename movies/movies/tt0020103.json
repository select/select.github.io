      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Pre-code crime-drama The Locked Door follows a young Barbara Stanwyck as a naive girl in the wrong place at the wrong time, with her past eventually catching up to her. While critics were not impressed by the overall plot, Stanwyck and comic relief Zazu Pitts both received acclaim for their roles in this picture.  ",
