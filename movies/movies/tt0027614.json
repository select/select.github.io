The lights are shot out, and when they come on again, Walters is found stabbed with Rivell's Bowie knife in his back. Unable to explain, Rivell makes a getaway where, in the hills, he meets Molly Henderson, whose grandfather \"Wild Horse\" Henderson, has told her he knows Rivell is not guilty of any of the killings. Unknown to Walters, who has recovered from the stabbing,his foreman Bart Hunter is working with Decker against Walters, and Hunter also plans to double-cross Decker after he tidies up a few things. Cowhand \"Six-Bits\" tells Rivell the background before Rivell rides to rescue Molly, who has been captured by one of Hawk's henchmen. Walters is leading the Rocking U cowhands in a running fight against Decker's gang. Hunter shoots down Decker, then lies in ambush for Walters. Rivell rides up and drops Hunter with a bullet. Henderson reveals that Molly, unknown to Walters, is the daughter of Walters' son and Henderson's daughter, thereby making Molly the heir to the Rocking U.",
