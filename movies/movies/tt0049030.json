    "Plot": "The Brave One is a bull named Gitano (Gypsy). A Mexican boy, Michael Ray, \"adopts\" Gitano after saving the animal's life during a storm. The friendship between bull and boy is threatened when Gitano's legal owners claim the animal and ship him off to the bullring. Moved by the boy's plight, the President of Mexico signs a \"pardon\" for Gitano--but not soon enough to prevent the bull's appearance at the Plaze de Mexico at Mexico City, where he faces top matador Fermin Rivera. Based on a true incident, the film earned a \"best story\" Academy Award for one Robert Rich--who, much to the embarrassment of the Academy (and the delight of civil libertarians), turned out to be blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.",
