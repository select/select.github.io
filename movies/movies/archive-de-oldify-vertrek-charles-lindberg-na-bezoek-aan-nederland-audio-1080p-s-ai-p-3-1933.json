      "description": "Interesting restored, enhanced & colorized historical footage of the Lindbergh's second World aviation tour in 1933. In the 1930s Charles Lindbergh had become World famous for being the first pilot to cross the Atlantic non stop from New York to Paris. This event took place in May 1927 in his 'Spirit of St.Louis' aircraft. In 1933 Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne flew from New York to Newfoundland, then to Europe via Labrador, Greenland, and Iceland. After visiting several European cities as far east as Moscow, they flew down the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic to South America. They flew down the Amazon and then back north to New York. The trip covered 30,000 miles, four continents, and 21 countries. The name of their plane was the \"Tingmissartoq\", which means \"one who flies like a big bird\" in Eskimo Inuit. The type of plane was a Lockheed Model 8 Sirius water plane. For the 1931 and 1933 flights, Anne learned radio procedures, Morse code, and celestial navigation. When asked about the potential dangers of the flights for his wife, Charles replied, “But you must remember, she is crew.” Here we see the Lindberghs landing at Vlieghaven Schellingwoude near Amsterdam. The Lindberghs are met among other by the famous Dutch flight pioneer Anthony Fokker and his wife. According to the \"Pioneers of Flight\" website, The Lindberghs' 1933 survey flight from New York to Europe was critical in planning commercial air routes. Pan American Airways, Imperial Airways, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes. This website also states that the Lindberghs were meticulous in their preparations for flights over five continents. While fuel and oil were stationed and lodging and meals provided at their planned stops (or by their support ship Jelling on the second flight), they slept in the aircraft and ate canned rations when necessary. “We must be prepared for a forced landing in the North, where we would need warm bedding and clothes; and in the South, where we ought to have an insect-proof tent; and on the ocean, where we would need, in addition to food, plenty of fresh water. And we must not exceed our limited weight budget. Every object to be taken had to be weighed mentally as well as physically.” Sometimes the Lindberghs spent the night on the Tingmissartoq. Lindbergh stated: “Our equipment, neatly packed on the floor in layers according to degrees of softness, made a comfortable bed... First the oars; then, the tool-kit and spare parts of the engine, the cans of food, the bulky canvas bags of emergency equipment, the rubber boat, the tent roll, extra coils of rope; next, our parachute packs; then our blanket rolls of clothing; our two flying suits for a top mattress; and lastly the sleeping bag. According to the route map shown in this film, the visit to the Netherlands occurred on 2 November 1933 when the Lindbergs arrived from Paris and lasted until 7 november when they departed via Rotterdam airport to Geneva. They landed there on 8 November 1933. Source: Beeld En Geluid, Dutch online film archive. Music: Howard Harper Barnes - \"Do You Want To Fly a Kite\" & Trevor Kowalski - \"Aero\". Commentary: Rick.
