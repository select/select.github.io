    "Plot": "Just watched this Columbia/Charles Mintz cartoon starring a now-forgotten character. A boy named Scrappy. Here he's driving (What? An underage boy driving a car? Oh, well, this is just a cartoon so anything's possible here!) himself with his little brother and a dog to camping grounds. All that happens here is done to a musical beat with the public domain song \"Turkey in the Straw\" being among the selections in the score. Quite a few bizarre things happen like when a fire goes up, it burns the skin off of some owls revealing their naked bodies and legs (though no frontal parts are shown!). Also, when the dog gets himself stuck on a chopped tree trunk lying on the ground, some squirrels play with his tail like an instrument. This was another vintage and obscure cartoon that I was glad to have found on YouTube. So on that note, I say give Camping Out a shot.",
