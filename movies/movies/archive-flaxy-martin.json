A girl is murdered, with the evidence pointing to Flaxy, and Colby takes the rap and gets a 20-year sentence. San Malko gives Colby the clue to the real killer, and, en route to prison, he escapes and is found by Nora Carson, who shelters him. After escaping from one of Richie's gunmen, Walter heads for Flaxy's apartment, where she admits she double-crossed him. (IMDB)",
