      "description": "Fingerprints don't lie - which is why a state governor with a hidden criminal past wants a file card with his prints stolen from FBI headquarters.  Shirley Wayne stumbles onto the Govenor's secret putting Agents Glen Stedman and Jeff Donley on the case. With Blake and Carl Stockton scheming in the shadows, it’s a race of wits, badges, and double-crosses, and a wild helicopter-motorboat chase, it’s a race to see who outsmarts who before the truth gets buried.\n\nDirected by William A.
