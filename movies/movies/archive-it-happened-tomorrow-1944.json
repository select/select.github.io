      "description": "At the beginning of the 20th Century, an ambitious reporter discovers a way to get the next day's newspaper ahead of time, to the consternation of his new girldriend, who is part of a phony clairvoyant act. But despite getting promoted, he soon encounters more problems than good fortune. Director: René Clair Dick Powell as Larry Stevens Linda Darnell as Sylvia Smith Jack Oakie as Cigolini Edgar Kennedy as Inspector Mulrooney This was colorized using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
