      "description": "1909 Segundo de Chomón L'Araignée D'or The Gold Spider by Segundo de Chomón \"L'Araignée d'or\" (The Golden Spider 1909) is an excellent short film that tells a fantastic and delightful story wherein a lumberjack, who shares his strange adventure with the audience by looking directly into the camera, follows four gnomes during their peculiar stroll through the forest. In a pond of water, the gnomes pick up a golden spider who has special and profit making abilities. They take him to their cave where this talented insect weaves gold ingots that can be cut up into pieces, gold coins that are even minted. The use of stencil coloured images gives fantastic colours in accordance with the fairy tale spirit that permeates the picture, colouring techniques that Herr Chomón, together with his wife, Frau Julienne Matthieu refined through the years and finally patented as \"Pathécolour\"( \"Pathé\", of course was the French silent company managed by the Pathé brothers for whom Herr Chomón worked during his French period). So, don't miss a minute of this beautiful fable where strange creatures and skillful insects from ancient times come to life before your commoner eyes thanks to the magic of Chomón. Director: Segundo de Chomón Writer: Segundo de Chomón Country: France Language: French Release Date: 18 May 1910 (USA) Release Date: England 1909 Release Date: France 1908",
