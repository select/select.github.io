      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with poster art from one of the movies overlayed with drive-in style audio.  Making your DVD is real easy: Download the zipped folder, open it, and extract the VIDEO_TS folder  and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD features a couple of Roger Corman scifi flicks from the 60's, WAR OF THE SATELLITES & VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET, as well as the preview and intermission reels. note: this page has been re-edited.",
