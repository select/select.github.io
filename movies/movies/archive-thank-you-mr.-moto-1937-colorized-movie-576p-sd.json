      "description": "Mr. Moto is a fictional Japanese secret agent created in a series of  spy and adventure novels  by the American author  John P. Marquand . He appeared in six novels published between 1935 and 1957, which were set in 1930s China on the eve of the  Second Sino-Japanese War . He became even more widely known from Hollywood films and a radio series. Marquand created the character for the  Saturday Evening Post , which was seeking stories with an Asian hero after the death of  Charlie Chan 's creator  Earl Derr Biggers .   Although Marquand presented Mr. Moto as a \"good guy,\" later writers objected that he reinforced prevailing racial and ethnic stereotypes. Mr. Moto appeared in other media in ways that are quite different from the novel. Eight motion pictures starred  Peter Lorre  between 1937 and 1939, 23 radio shows starred  James Monks  broadcast in 1951, a 1965 film starred  Henry Silva , and a 2003 comic book produced by  Moonstone Books , later reprinted as Welcome Back, Mr. Moto.",
