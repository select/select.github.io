      "description": "A small-town doctor (Kevin McCarthy) and his girlfriend (Dana Wynter) discover that the population of their community is gradually being replaced by unfeeling alien duplicates bent on world domination. Directed by Don Siegel, based on the novel by Jack Finney. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
