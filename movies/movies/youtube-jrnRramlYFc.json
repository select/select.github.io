      "description": "RING OF FIRE: Part ONE - When an oil rig causes a volcanic eruption in a small town, it’s not just an isolated event—as environmental activist Emily Booth and former oil company analyst Matthew Cooper fear. It’s just the first in a series that could effect the dangerous Ring of Fire that contains most of the world's volcanos. Before the earth is swallowed whole by a cataclysmic series of eruptions, only Matthew knows how to stop it. It’s a suicide mission, but the only alternative is an Extinction Level Event. The end of the world.\n\nWatch PART TWO here: https://youtu.be/pvusTkHAX-Q\n\nTerry O'Quinn, \nMichael Vartan, \nLauren Lee Smith, \nAgam Darshi, \nIan Tracey, \nBrian Markinson, \nConnor Levins, \nAdam Greydon Reid, \nLaci J.
