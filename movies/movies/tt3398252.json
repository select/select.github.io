In the meantime, twenty-five long years later, Joe's ex-partner, Detective Frank Washington, and his new partner, Officer Higgins, are caught up in the middle of a dangerous turf war, as three rivalling gangs--the Katanas, the Shinjukus, and the Ginzas--fight for control. Now, as the bodies start piling up, pacifist Joe reluctantly picks up where he and his old friend left off, taking matters into their own hands in search of answers. Who can stop furious Samurai Cop from taking his rightful revenge on those who destroyed his future?",
