    "Plot": "The Terrytoons are oddly interesting, mainly for anybody wanting to see (generally) older cartoons made by lesser known and lower-budget studios. They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content. Of the 1930 Terrytoons up to this cartoon, 'Hungarian Goulash' is the best of them and among the better 1930 Terrytoons overall. Instead of the mostly watchable but unexceptional standard of the previous cartoons, with two lacklustre ones ('Roman Punch' and 'Hawaiian Pineapples), 'Hungarian Goulash' (only just noticed the food titles connection with the early Terrytoons) is pretty good. Will say though that a large part of me does wish the French prints with German subtitles with a silhouetted orchestra opening sequences, the opening titles for the US (?) prints, like here, are nowhere near as inspired. 'Hungarian Goulash' is not perfect. The story is thin and formulaic as heck, and don't expect it to make much sense because it doesn't. There is some crudeness here and there too, mainly in some of the movements. With all that being said, 'Hungarian Goulash' actually manages to be one of the better-looking 1930 Terrytoons, with some typically ambitious backgrounds, remarkably witty drawings, some inventiveness and the lake reflection part is pretty inspired visually. It also boasts some of the sharpest and neatest synchronisation of the early Terrytoons, quite an accomplishment. Despite the story not being much special, it is carried along by a lively pace, natural charm and numerous pretty amusing absurdist gags. The characters may not have significant development to them but are not annoying or personality deprived.Best of all about 'Hungarian Goulash' is the music score. And no it is not just the cleverly used healthy dose of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. In summary, pretty good. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
