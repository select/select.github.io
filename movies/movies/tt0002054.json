      "description": "A Beast at Bay was directed by D W Griffith in 1912. It stars Mary Pickford as the girl. These pictures were made so quickly, averaging two a week, that there are always errors that are allowed to pass. For example the tramp who tries to start a fight is almost off camera. But there are also regular advances in film technique. The cutting between the train and the cars, or the point of view shot when the hero looks through the binoculars.",
