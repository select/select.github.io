      "description": "Re-mastered in HD. This top-notch film noir suspense thriller gave actor Paul Henreid (Casablanca) a chance to trade in his romantic image for not one, but two sinister performances. After a botched hit on a casino, gambler John Muller (Henreid) has nowhere to run and with a band of killers hired by a rival mobster on his trail, he’s mistaken for the psychiatrist Dr. Bartok, his dead ringer. He decides to kill Bartok and impersonate him, but it’s not long before the doctor’s beautiful secretary (Joan Bennett, The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street) is on to him and Muller discovers the doctor had a few of his skeletons in the closet.  Soundtracks Blue Danube Waltz (uncredited) Written by Johann Strauss Whistled by Muller's workmate at the garage.",
