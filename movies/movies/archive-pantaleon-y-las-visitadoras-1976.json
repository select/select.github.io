      "description": "Somehow a very straight laced officer is selected to run a squadron of hookers. No idea why he is the perfect candidate for the job but much like Henry Winkler in Night Shift, he takes the job seriously (computer spreadsheets and everything) and wins the day. Sort of.  In Spanish with English Subtitles  Ignore date on file, this is actually the 1999 remake of the film",
