      "description": "Straitlaced senatorial hopeful David Stratton (John Forsythe) has no idea what he's in for when he arrives home from a trip to find sexy teen Jody (Ann-Margret) curled up asleep in his daughter's bed. Soon, delinquent Jody is holding David -- and his plush suburban home -- hostage while she hides out from the cops and throws wild parties with her beatnik pals. David, terrified of scandal, agrees to drive Jody and her friends to Mexico, a decision he regrets when the ride gets out of control.",
