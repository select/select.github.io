    "Plot": "Looks like the film that might have inspired Hugo Haas to make one like it twice a year in the early fifties. Connie (June Lang) is all smitten with lighthouse keeper Sam Wells (Don Castle), but he brushes her off and she ups and marries his fellow-lighthouse keeper Hank Armitage (John Litel) out of spite. All three live together in the close confines of the lighthouse and jealously and recrimination rise nearly as high inside as the pounding surf and howling winds outside. It also begins to look like an Edgar G. Ulmer) film, if it wasn't so semi-rational. Sam is pleased with the situation that appears to him to promise action with no responsibilities. But Connie, in addition to rebuffing Sam's unwanted passes, is actually falling in love with ol' Hank. Trouble is brewing.",
