      "description": "1937 directed by Joseph Kane starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, Betty Bronson, LeRoy Mason, Charles Middleton, Russell Simpson, Jack Dougherty, Henry Hall and the Tennessee Ramblers. It's Cattle-men versus Turpentiners, with Gene (and a girl) caught in the middle. Lots of singin', shootin' and hard ridin'.",
