This is possibly a short excerpt from an unknown episode of an action serial by the name of \"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Gibson.  As with all other episodes, this one was likely directed by J.P. McGowan from a story by Edward T. Matlack.  A total of 119 weekly one reel films were produced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917.  The first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson.  They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick thinking.  Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest ever.  Very few of the films survive, and we are happy to  be able to show this rarity to our esteemed viewers.
