    "Plot": "I'm not sure whether I saw the entire film as the print I saw on the internet was only about 75 seconds long. Firstly, the film probably qualifies for a 'crazy credit' entry on this site as it's title is written on a board held, presumably, by one of the Whitsuntide revellers at Preston.The film shows a few brief scenes from the fair and, like most of Mitchell and Kenyon's films, offers us a valuable insight into a way of life long gone. Unfortunately, the cameraman too often appears to be the star as the subjects of his apparatus stare at him going about his work. Perhaps with a touch of irony, the final shot dwells on a group of people sounding outside a building bearing a large sign bearing a single word: Cinematograph.",
