      "description": "The Sunbeam was directed by D W Griffith in 1912. When a film called The Sunbeam refers to a little girl with a dead mother, you know you are in for a bit of sentimentality and so you are. But given that, it is a neat little film with an interesting picture of life in a tenement house and the social mores of the day.",

Believing the bachelor perpetrated one particular prank, the spinster woman enters his room to confront him. She is followed by a neighbor child. Meanwhile, the other children have stolen a scarlet fever quarantine sign and posted it on the bachelor's door. The police, unaware that the quarentine sign is a prank, enforce the confinement. But aided by the sweet disposition of the toddler quarantined with them, the icy relations between spinster and bachelor begin to thaw, . . .",
