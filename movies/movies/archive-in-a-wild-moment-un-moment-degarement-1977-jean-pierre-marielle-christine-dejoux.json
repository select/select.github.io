      "description": "This film by Claude Berri is apparently the source for Blame it on Rio. The story line is pretty much exactly the same. I am put in mind of the old 80's sexploitation films where a director would pick a movie based on which exotic locale he wanted to visit next. At any rate, another film where a 17 year old girl inexplicably falls in love with a 60 year old man. I found and added English subtitles thanks to opensubtitles.org and Handbrake.",
