      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first all African-American starring/directed sound feature, The Exile was quite low budget for its time. In the film, a young man falls in love with a girl who is involved in the criminal underworld. He cant seem to pull himself away from her, and soon finds himself wrapped up in the worst possible outcome. Modern viewers recognize the historical importance of the film, but highlight that it is overall a bit bland, and the technical side is weak. ",
