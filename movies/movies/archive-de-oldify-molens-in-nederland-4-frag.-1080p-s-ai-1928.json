      "description": "For centuries The Netherlands has been famous for its windmills. They were (and some still are) used to grind grain, saw wood or to pump water out the many polders. This interesting A.I. restored and colorized film consists of five fragments, showing: - A windmill being prepared for duty in 1928 - Three windmills in the Driemanspolder near Leidschendam in 1938 - A \"poldermolen\" in the town of Noordwijkerhout in 1939 - A windmill near Amsterdam, bound to be replaced by a coal-fired power station. - Many windmills at dusk, filmed in the Schermer polder in 1928. Currently 11 of these windmills still exist. An interesting fact about windmills is that the position of the wings while the windmill is in rest shows six specific events like: happy or sad events that affect the miller as well as a short, long or fast re-start or a festive position. The original B&W films have been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, AI enhanced and AI colorized by means of sophisticated software. Source B&W footage: Beeld En Geluid Music: Trevor Kowalski.",
