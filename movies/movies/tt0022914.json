    "Plot": "Freddy the Freshman, a canine college student wearing a beanie, over-sized eyeglasses and a raccoon coat, arrives at a pep rally. Did we say raccoon coat? It turns out his coat is made of live cats, who sing the praises of Freddy along with everyone else. Freddy proves worthy of this adulation when his performance at a football game leads his school to victory. But don't expect ordinary football. Dachshunds, mice, lions, pigs, ducks and other members of a menagerie are the players. The football field is complete with a tree, a puddle, and even a clothesline (with long underwear and bloomers hanging out to dry). The cheerleaders are three Jewish parrots and an effeminate rooster. Meanwhile, no one speaks when he can sing the title song. \"Are ya listenin'?\" asks the announcer. \"Hmmm?\"",
