      "description": "The Man with Nine Lives is a 1940 American horror science fiction film directed by Nick Grinde and starring Boris Karloff. Both The Man with Nine Lives and The Man They Could Not Hang were based in part on the real-life saga of Dr.  Robert Cornish, a University of California professor who, in 1934, announced that he had restored life to a dog named Lazarus, which he had put to death by clinical means.  The resulting publicity led to Cornish being booted off campus. Wikipedia   In the film ,  Dr. Tim Mason discovers Dr. Leon Kravaal, who has been frozen for ten years due to his experiments with \"frozen therapy.\" After reviving Kravaal, they face challenges as Kravaal attempts to unlock the secrets of his research while dealing with the consequences of his past actions.",
