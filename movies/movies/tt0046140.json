      "description": "It’s cowboys vs Indians and brother vs brother in this action-packed B-oater staring Rex Allen and his horse Koko. Leonard Nimoy is featured as a renegade Indian chief. Be advised it also includes a lot of “the only good Indian is a dead Indian” racism. Above average production values. Remake of “The Apache Kid” (1941). IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by William Witney. Released in 1953. Complete print. AKA “Overland Trail Riders” ",
