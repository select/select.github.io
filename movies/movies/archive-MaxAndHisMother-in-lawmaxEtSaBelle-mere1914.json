      "description": "Pathe comedy by Max Linder, \"the Motion Picture's first truly international Star\" (Jack Spears, 1965), who wrote, directed and starred in this film, alongside Paquerette as \"mother-in-law\". \"A young man, newly married, has great difficulty in getting rid of his mother-in-law, she even going so far as to accompany them on their honeymoon. They go to the Swiss Mountain resort. The things that that poor mother-in-law is made to do are legion, and all of them funny, including a session on the ice, a catastrophe on the coasting hill, and an extremely exciting and ludicrous performance on skis. She is so battered up by this latter performance that she is forced to receive medical attention, and the lovers are at last able to have some time to themselves.\" (The New York Dramatic Mirror, August 4, 1915) Note: The date in the opening title is wrong. Apparently this print was released before film historians found out that there are two different films with the same title. For more information you can go to my website: www.maxlinder.de",
