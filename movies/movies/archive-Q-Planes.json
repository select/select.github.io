      "description": "A secret British aviation project is being disrupted by a foreign power, until an effete but supremely confident military-intelligence agent, Charles Hammond (Ralph Richardson), is assigned the case. What follows is a tense espionage thriller that refuses to take itself seriously. Yet strangely, this odd mixture of screwball comedy and political-thriller works and everyone involved with this brisk comedy/thriller seems to be enjoying themselves immensely.",
