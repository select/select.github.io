      "description": "An American professor (Dana Andrews) travels to London for a parapsychology conference at which he intends to expose a demonic-cult leader (Niall MacGinnis), only to discover that the demonic curse is real. Based on the short story \"Casting the Runes\" by M.R. James Dana Andrews as John Holden Peggy Cummins as Joanna Harrington Niall MacGinnis as Doctor Julian Karswell Maurice Denham as Professor Henry Harrington Athene Seyler as Mrs. Karswell Liam Redmond as Mark O'Brien Reginald Beckwith as Mr. Meek this release re-titled \"Night of the Demon\" for the U.K. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
