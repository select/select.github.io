      "description": "The Lost Missile is a 1958 science fiction film directed by Lester Wm. Berke . Originally intended to be directed by his father, William Berke , the film became his son’s project after William’s sudden passing. Starring Robert Loggia and Ellen Parker , the film runs for approximately 70 minutes and explores themes of impending disaster during the Cold War era.  The story unfolds as an unidentified, missile-like object emerges in space, prompting a military response from a European nation strongly implied to be behind the Iron Curtain. Their attempt to intercept the object with a missile results in failure; instead of destruction, the explosion merely redirects the missile into a perilous orbit around the Earth. As the missile passes close to the ground—blazing and incinerating everything in its path—a team at the Havenbrook Atomic Laboratory is preparing for a wedding. The urgency escalates when the military recognizes the threat the missile poses to cities like New York.",
