      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Though the Katherine Hepburn version is more well remembered today, the original Quality Street adaptation was a critical hit as well. Unfortunately, the box office did not match that acclaim, and it was one of star Marion Davies lowest grossing films. Davies plays a woman who waits years for her suitor to return from war, only for him to think that the years have not been kind to her. ",
