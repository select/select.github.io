      "description": "This film shows the beauty of Hawaii over 116 years ago! This is a compilation of vintage film footage by the Thomas Edison film company in 1906. Among other you can watch the relaxed life of a fishing community, everyday life on ranches, native Hawaians arriving and leaving a \"Luau\" party, spended views of Oahu and the town of Honolulu, including Waikiki beach, as well as great beach scenes. The film footage has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of Artificial Intelligence video software. Music: Gerard Franklin. Note: We tried to find copyright free Hawaiian music, but failed (Youtube rejected everything we tried). So there was no other option than to use nice neutral music from contemporary composers.",
