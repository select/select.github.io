      "description": "This satirical version of \"Red Riding Hood\" was, especially the ending, very topical when released in 1941, as the US had instituted a draft lottery long before Pearl Harbor (December 7,1941.) The wolf convinces Red he is a police dog and he hastily beats a path to Grandma's house with intentions of making a meal of her. But Grandma's boyfriend shows up and takes her dancing. He then plans on eating Red, but the postman arrives with his draft induction notice. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/red-riding-hood-rides-again-1941/",
