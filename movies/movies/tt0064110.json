      "description": "The costly battle between Germans and Americans for the last undestroyed bridge over the Rhine near Remagen in March 1945.  A production striving for historical accuracy and objectivity, it skillfully breathes life into familiar clichés and characters. The film, which makes immense external effort, largely succeeds in highlighting the mercilessness of the war and avoiding heroization.",
