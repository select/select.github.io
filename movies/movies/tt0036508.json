      "description": "Wackiki Wabbit is a 1943 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon, starring Bugs Bunny. It was released on July 3, 1943, and was written by Tedd Pierce and directed by Chuck Jones. Mel Blanc voiced Bugs Bunny, and the two castaways were voiced by Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce; no screen credit was given for any voice actors. Ken Harris is solely credited as the cartoon’s animator, but other character animators who worked on the film were Ben Washam and Robert Cannon. John McGrew was the layout artist, and the background scenery was painted by Gene Fleury and Bernyce Polifka—all uncredited. Watch on RetroFlix.org:  https://retroflix.org/wackiki-wabbit-1943/",
