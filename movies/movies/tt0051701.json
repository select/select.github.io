      "description": "Life in and around a British bomber base from 1940 to early 1943. Excellent cast. Solid direction. Good production. This isn't a traditional war actioner. Rather it's a drama with romantic elements of how lives are impacted by war. Although highly regarded now, it flopped at its US opening, possibly because audiences were expecting a British actioner like \"One of Our Aircraft is Missing\" or \"We Dive at Dawn.\" Directed by Anthony Asquith. Released in 1945. a.k.a. \"Johnny in the Clouds\" (US). Complete print CAST NOTES: Jean Simmons appears in the minor role of a singer. Burgess Meredith had been offered Douglass Montgomery's role (Johnny Hollis). NOTE: \"One of Our Aircraft is Missing\" and \"We Dive at Dawn\" are available here at IA.",
