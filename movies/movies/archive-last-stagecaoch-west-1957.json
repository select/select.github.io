      "description": "The coming of the railroad spells the end of Rand McCord (Victory Jory)'s stagecoach line in Cedar City, as the government gives the mail contract to the fastest means of delivery. McCord only has enough money left to buy a ranch and some cattle, but comes on the idea of hiring outlaws to wreck trains, rob express offices and steal cattle. The railroads send special agent Bill Cameron (Jim Davis) on an undercover mission to end this reign of violence, and Cameron falls in with McCord's daughter (Mary Castle), who is unaware of her father's activities. The movie reunites actors Jim Davis and Mary Castle, who played railroad detectives in the 1954-55 TV series \"Stories of the Century\". I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. With Lee Van Cleef, Grant Withers, Roy Barcroft, Glenn Strange and Tris Coffin.",
