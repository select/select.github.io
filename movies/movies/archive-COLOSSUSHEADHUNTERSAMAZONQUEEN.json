      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu with a photo of the title character with drive-in style audio. SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, which is the most hassle-free way, but I've also uploaded the files outside of the .zip so they can be viewed on this site. This DVD contains the movies COLOSSUS AND THE HEADHUNTERS & COLOSSUS AND THE AMAZON QUEEN, as well as the preview and intermission reels to play like an old drive-in show",
