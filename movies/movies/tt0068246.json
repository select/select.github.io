At the Mexican border, Roy catches-up with Alicia who married yet another man, river-boat casino owner Francisco Montero. Roy is hungry for Alicia, for money and for revenge. Alicia convinces Roy and Montero to join forces and follow her into Mexico where a Revolutionary leader is offering one million dollars to any mercenary who can destroy a federal Mexican Army arsenal. Of course, Roy and Montero agree with Alicia's plan. They all head to Mexico, willing to risk their lives for one million dollars. Once arrived at their destination, the unlikely partners find that the Revolutionary leader is a bit loco and the task more difficult than imagined. The million dollar reward is real alright but crosses and double-crosses ensue.",
