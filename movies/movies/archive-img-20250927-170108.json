      "description": "\"You Nazty Spy!\" (1940) is one of the most famous Three Stooges shorts, notable as the first Hollywood film to openly satirize Adolf Hitler before the U.S. entered World War II. Moe plays the Hitler-like dictator of the fictional country of Moronica, with Larry and Curly as his bumbling sidekicks. Mixing sharp political parody with the Stooges’ trademark slapstick, it remains both a bold piece of satire and a hilarious classic. Colorized and digitally enhanced as God intended.",
