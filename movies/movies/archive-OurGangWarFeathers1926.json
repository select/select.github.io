      "description": "While on a cross-country train trip, the Our Gang kids drive the rest of the passengers crazy with a never-ending game of cowboys and Indians. During a stopover in the sleepy town of Red Dog, the kids disembark in hopes of savoring a taste of genuine Western life. They get more than they bargained for when a trio of bandits rides into town for a showdown with the local sheriff. Meanwhile, black youngster Allen \"Farina\" Hoskins tries to pass himself off as an Indian, but the members of a local tribe aren't amused. The silent, two-reel Our Gang comedy War Feathers was originally released on November 21, 1926~ Hal Erickson",
