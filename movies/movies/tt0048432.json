      "description": "From university to rural practice, the film follows the career of a highly gifted doctor from a poor background who, after a surgical error, must learn to abandon perfectionism and self-righteousness and find greater humanity and love. A broadly based, melodramatic portrayal of life and character, respectfully and unequivocally emphasizes medical ethics and respect for humanity. Impressively acted, tightly and excitingly staged, the film itself builds a positive image of a superhuman, although the blatantly patriarchal portrayal of gender roles undermines the intended progressive message.",

    "Plot": "Intern Lucas Marsh is intent upon becoming not just a successful doctor but a first-class one. He courts and marries the warm-hearted Kristina, not out of love but because she is highly knowledgeable in the skills of the operating room, and because she has frugally put aside her savings through the years. He shrewdly knows that she will be a supportive wife in every way. She helps make him the success he wants to be and cheerfully moves with him to the small town in which he starts his practice. But as much as he tries to be a good husband to the undemanding Kristina, Marsh easily falls into the arms of a local siren and the patience of long-sorrowing Kristina wears thin. She reasons he no longer needs her and asks for a divorce. A calamity now brings Marsh to his senses. Dr. Runkleman, Marsh's gruff and wise employer, is stricken with a heart attack and requires emergency surgery. Marsh is forced to operate.",
