      "description": "An adaptation of Bedřich Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride. Set in 19th century Bohemia, the matchmaker Kezal wants to bring the mayor's daughter Marie and the rich landowner's son Wenzel together. Both of them, however, have already fallen in love with someone else. The endearing characters, a whimsical storyline and quiet humor combine with catchy tunes, a pastoral setting and fluid camera work. A last hurrah in the wanning days of Weimar cinema, by non-other than Max Ophüls. One of the early cinematic works of the prolific director, which he made a year before fleeing Germany after the Reichstagbrand. It probably provided a welcome distraction for German moviegoers during those turbulant times.",
