      "description": "This is another short film that shows Giethoorn from a different angle as seen by the skipper of a so called \"Punter\". These little, manually pole-driven, boats were (and still are) used to transport goods, people and even cattle through Giethoorn's many canals. Giethoorn lies in the North East of The Netherlands in the province of Overijssel and is the most beautiful, picturesq village in the Netherlands with its many (176) characteristic wooden bridges, the Punters and the surrounding farms and houses. The canals were dug to transport turf which was the main source of income for Giethoorn about a century ago. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, slightly speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of A.I. software.
