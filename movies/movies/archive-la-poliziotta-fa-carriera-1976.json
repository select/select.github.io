      "description": "Glitch in the upload system and now there are two copies of this movie. Files are the same. A curious woman is enlisted as a police woman thanks to her looks that impressed a police commissioner who's her neighbor. She spreads havoc since the entry exams and during the first cases she's assigned to, but ends up with a promotion. Yet another film with Edwige and Alvaro Vitali. Same basic plot for most of these, Edwige starts out blundering but saves the day eventually. Italian with optional English Subtiles",
