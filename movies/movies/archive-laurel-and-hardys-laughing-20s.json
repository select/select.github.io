      "description": "Laurel And Hardy's Laughing 20's Compilation by Robert Youngson of highlights from the 1920s Silent screen comedies of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . Black-and-white. Comedy. Released in 1965. Although perhaps best remembered from its many television showings, this documentary about the early career of Laurel and Hardy, in the era before the coming of the Talkies, was originally released in motion picture theatres. This is not a silent movie: in addition to a period musical score, the soundtrack also includes Youngson's voice-over commentary on the films from which the various clips are derived. This is one of several compilations which he made for theatrical release featuring the Silent comedies of the 1920s, which were enjoying a revival of interest in the 1950s and '60s due in large part to his efforts; but this is the only one to feature Laurel and Hardy exclusively. The earlier compilations featured a mixture of film sequences showcasing the talents of the many comedians who were making short-subject silent comedies (two or three reelers) during the 1920s.",
