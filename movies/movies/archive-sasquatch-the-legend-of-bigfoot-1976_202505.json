      "description": "Sasquatch, also known as Sasquatch, the Legend of Bigfoot, is a 1976 American pseudo-documentary horror film directed by Ed Ragozzino and starring George Lauris, Steve Boergadine, and Jim Bradford. It follows a group of explorers on a summer-long search for the mythical Bigfoot creature. It was distributed by North American Film Productions, Oregon Ltd., at the height of public fascination with accounts and tales of Bigfoot sightings. Though set in British Columbia, Canada, the film was shot in the Cascade Mountains near Bend, Oregon. While sometimes compared to other Bigfoot documentary films of the era such as The Legend of Boggy Creek (1972) and Creature From Black Lake (1976), the film does not feature on-camera interviews with possible eyewitnesses.",
