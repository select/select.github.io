      "description": "“A superior movie” “Donald Cook showcase” (IMDB reviews quotes). A compact Depression era romantic drama with a strong cast, sharp dialog, crisp direction and good production values for type. A lot of plot from two story lines is skillfully shoehorned into less than 70 minutes. Good print too. So what’s not to like? IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Charles Lamont. Released in 1936. Complete print.",
