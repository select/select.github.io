      "description": "A LOJA DOS HORRORES ( The Little Shop of Horrors, USA ) ( Filme Completo / Legendado em Português ) Data de Lançamento:  05 de Agosto de 1960 » SOBRE O FILME: Uma das primeiras comédias de humor negro já feitas e tornou-se um clássico do cinema. O filme conta a história de Seymour Krelboin (Jonathan Haze) que trabalha numa floricultura nos arredores de Skid Row e que está apaixonado por sua colega de serviço, Audrey (Jackie Joseph). Seymour adquire uma nova planta e dá a ela o nome de Audrey II, depois do amor de sua vida. Só que a planta precisa de carne e sangue humano para sobreviver, levando o desesperado Seymour a uma frenética busca para lhe encontrar comida. . O cineasta e produtor americano Roger Corman, nascido em 1926 em Los Angeles, é um daqueles nomes que ficaram marcados para sempre no gênero fantástico, através de seus incontáveis filmes de baixo orçamento, feitos com um mínimo de recursos compensados com muita criatividade e talento, lançando atores e diretores que tornaram-se muito famosos posteriormente. Um de seus primeiros filmes, e que tornou-se um clássico do humor negro, foi A Pequena Loja dos Horrores (The Little Shop of Horrors), produzido em preto e branco em 1960, utilizando atores desconhecidos na época como Jack Nicholson (numa pequena ponta), realizando as filmagens em apenas dois dias, e ainda contando com incríveis efeitos precários. » » DIREÇÃO: Roger Corman GÊNERO: Comédia,  Fantasia, Terror ORIGEM: USA DURAÇÃO: 72 minutos » » ELENCO PRINCIPAL: Jonathan Haze ...
