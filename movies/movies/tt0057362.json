      "description": "The last hours before the violent death of Mahatma Gandhi (1948).   The focus is neither on the great Indian nor on a coherent analysis of the religious-political background to his assassination, but rather on the loosely formulated life story of the young murderer, presented according to the successful American formula. Little more than colorful adventure cinema with sparse psychological depth.",
