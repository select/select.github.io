    "Plot": "A society mother, whose creditors are becoming insistent, and wishing to keep up her ostentation, sees relief in her daughter marrying a low-charactered, pusillanimous millionaire. Hence, she persuades her daughter to accept his proposal, arguing that they must have money. The girl goes to the seashore to rest before the wedding, and there meets the mate of a tramp schooner anchored in the bay. This man appeals to her as being so different from others, a primal type of man. She indulges in that dangerous pastime of flirting with this sincere fellow and when her fiancée visits her, the seaman realizes he has been made the dupe, so he seizes the girl and is carrying her off by force. However, he suddenly reasons that she isn't worth it and recoils from her, but she now realizes that she truly loves him and begs him to take her away, so grabbing her up in one arm, and a minister who is passing by, in the other, he hustles aboard his boat, where the marriage is performed.",
