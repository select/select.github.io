      "description": "An inheritance sends a bored British couple off on an adventure that leads to a ship wreck and a seriocomic romantic odyssey that includes infidelity. An adaptation of the novel by Dale Collins. Not the usual Hitchcock fare but easily recognizable as his and definitely worth a look. Adapted & directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Released in 1932. Complete print. a.k.a. \"East of Shanghai\" (US) TRIVIA: Don't bother looking for Hitch in this one.",
