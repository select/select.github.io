      "description": "When ex-small-time criminal Kelly Olson (Doug Wilson) returns to Los Angeles for his kid brother's funeral, not many people are happy to see him. Not his mother (Beppie De Vries), not his ex-girlfriend (Jeanne Baird), not the cops, and not local hood Rico Lanari (Tony Lewis). Kelly insists he's gone straight, but nobody believes him. Convinced his brother was murdered, he slips back into his thug ways to get a few answers from a bunch of low-lifes.",
