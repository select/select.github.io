      "description": "Edge of Doom is a 1950 black-and-white Film Noir directed by Mark Robson and starring Dana Andrews, Farley Granger, and Joan Evans.    When the film was released, the staff at Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, \"A grim, relentless story, considerably offbeat, gives some distinction to Edge of Doom. It is played to the hilt by a good cast and directed with impact by Mark Robson.”   Find out more about ‘Depictions of Religion in 1950’s Film Noir’ here. ",
