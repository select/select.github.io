      "description": "Several prohibition agents display cans and bottles of seized liquor for the camera. They are then shown dumping the goods at a junk yard, smashing up the tins and barrels seen earlier. The contents flow into what appears to be a lake of illegal hooch, and a few Negro residents are seen stealing some of the alcohol out of the battered leaking tins.",
