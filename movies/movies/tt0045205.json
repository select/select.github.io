      "description": "Sudden Fear Is a 1952 American film noir thriller directed by David Miller, and starring Joan Crawford, Gloria Grahame and Jack Palance. The screenplay by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith was based upon the novel of the same name by Edna Sherry. When François Truffaut saw it, he wrote: “There is not a shot in this film that isn’t necessary to its dramatic progression. Not a shot, either, that isn’t fascinating and doesn’t make us think it’s a masterpiece of cinema.” Sudden Fear was nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Actress (Crawford), Best Actor (Palance), Best Costume Design and Best Cinematography (Charles Lang).  Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Fear Suggested Film Noirs: http://bit.ly/36oLNCR The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.
