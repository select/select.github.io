      "description": "Former U. S. Army major, Paul Krenner (James Griffith), plans to conquer the world with an army of invisible soldiers and will do anything to achieve that goal. With the help of his hired muscle, Julian (Red Morgan), Krenner forces Dr. Peter Ulof (Ivan Trisault) to perfect the invisibility machine Ulof invented. He keeps Ulof's daughter, Maria (Carmel Daniel) imprisoned to keep Ulof in line.\n\nThe nuclear materials Ulof needs to better his invisibility machine are extremely rare and kept under guard in government facilities. Krenner arranges the prison break of notorious safecracker, Joey Faust (Douglas Kennedy), to steal the materials he needs. Of course Faust will do the jobs while invisible. Krenner offers Faust money for the jobs and Faust expresses his grievances against working for him. Faust tells him that he'll sing like a canary if he's returned to prison. Krenner tells Faust that he's wanted alive or dead. Faust reluctantly complies. However, when he meets Faust's woman, Laura Matson (Marguerite Chapman), he slowly charms her into a double cross.\n\nFaust continues attempting to escape and tries to get one over on Krenner. It looks like he may have the edge on Krenner when Faust attacks Krenner while invisible. However, Dr. Ulof's guinea pig dies and, during the second time he's invisible, Faust uncontrollably reverts from invisible to visible and back again. Despite these drawbacks Faust forges ahead intent on breaking free from Krenner's control.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Edgar G. Ulmer, produced by Lester D. Guthrie, Robert L. Madden and John Miller, written by Jack Lewis, starring Marguerite Chapman, Douglas Kennedy, James Griffith and Ivan Triesault.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Amazing Transparent Man\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
