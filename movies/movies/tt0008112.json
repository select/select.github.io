      "description": "Fatty Arbuckle stars with Buster Keaton and Al St. John not far behind. The first scene when Fatty us making sodas demonstrates what a fine comedian he was and hiw great he might have been were it not for the shabby accusations made against him and the three trials from which though he was acquitted his career never recovered.",
