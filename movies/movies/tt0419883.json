    "Plot": "It's a little difficult for me to follow THRIFT AND SAVING OF TASUKE SHIOBARA -- to use the English title offered on the Cartoon Research web site -- because the titles and soundtrack (added some time in the early 1940s) are in Japanese. However, it appears to be the adventures of a poor man who endures his lot in life, saves his money and eventually enjoys modest success.It's a propaganda piece extolling the Japanese virtues, based on a Kabuki play. As a piece of animation it's of interest because of its animation techniques (a variation of paper cut-outs) and elaborate background art.Its director was driven out of the business of producing new animation after he produced a pornographic effort.",
