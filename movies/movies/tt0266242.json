    "Plot": "I saw this concert for the first time late in 2001 (it had come out in 1999) and it is a remarkable musical testament to Johnny Cash the man and the musician.  The performances fr. such extraordinary performers as Springsteen, Dylan, U2, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, etc. are some of their finest individual efforts.  There are two extended filmed explorations of Cash's life &amp; career within the concert, which are deeply informative and well done.  They not only explore his musical legacy, but they place it in a musical &amp; social context that allows the viewer to understand the extraordinary impact that Cash has had on American country &amp; roots music over the past 4 decades.This is a breathtaking concert film.  Highly recommended.",
