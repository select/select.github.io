Then it's time to put on their finest and go to Church.There are plenty of Christmas cartoons, lots of them are suitable for Hallowe'en (although released at any old time of the year), Thanksgiving gets a few, usually with a turkey facing the axe, and Termite Terrace's OLD GLORY is a fine cartoon to show on the Fourth of July. It seems unlikely to me, but I can't think of. any other Easter cartoons.",
