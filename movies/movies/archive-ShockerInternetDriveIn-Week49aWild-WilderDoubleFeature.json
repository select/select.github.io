      "description": "Hellooooo and welcome back to everyone's favorite shocking internet drive-in! Well with summer in full swing (at least here in that wonderland of confusion - the good ol' USA), we thought it might be appropriate to chill things out a bit with some snow and surf. And what better way to chill things out than with two more classics brought to us by that film entrepreneur, W. Lee Wilder! First up, after some \"serial\" fun and a jiving cartoon, Billy's older brother brings us 1954's \"The Snow Creature\" about - you guessed it - an abominable snowman or Yeti. Following another wonderful intermission, we encourage everyone to take a swim with \"Manfish\", Wilder's classic take on Edgar Allen Poe's 'The Gold-Bug' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart' featuring everyone's favorite drunk - er - diver, Lon Chaney Jr.! Now, we ask, what else do you want for free? A little something from your front-seat companion? That's your problem pal! Just don't forget to visit the snackbar for a few more cool treats!
