      "description": "Based on news article about a noted Detroit car designer who hired a beautiful girl from Sweden as his maid. Her beauty quickly becomes so legendary that she ends up having countless rich and famous admirers and leaving for Hollywood. Kind of an American version of the Au Pair movies from England. Karen Ciral looks like the classic Swedish blonde and spends a lot of time in short skirts.",
