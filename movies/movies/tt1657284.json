      "description": "Ice Quake - At the Army Corps of Engineers, Martin's job is to monitor any threats to the Alaskan landscape. But the landscape is about to alter as the rapidly changing climate has created a scientific anomaly – an underground river of volatile liquid Methane. As the lethal river gains momentum, it sets off a succession of destructive earthquakes along its path. It becomes a race against time as Martin must find a way to stop the deadly river before it causes a catastrophic explosion that threatens the planet.\n2010.
