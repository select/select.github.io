      "description": "Sergei Eisenstein's film had an incredible impact on the development of cinema and is a masterful example of montage editing. When Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) sparks a revolt aboard the Potemkin, the crew clashes with Commander Golikov’s (Vladimir Barsk) harsh command, turning the Black Sea into a battleground. As Odessa’s streets surge with rebellion, the battleship charges forward, cannons roaring and the crew forging a united front. From rotten rations to revolutionary fire, Vakulinchuk’s defiance etches the Potemkin into history as a beacon of rebellion.\n\nColorized version https://youtu.be/ZnGchlxMZ50\n\n\nOriginal title: Bronenosets Potyomkin / Броненосец Потёмкин\nDirector: Sergei Eisenstein\nWriters: Nina Agadzhanova, Sergei Eisenstein, Grigoriy Aleksandrov\nStars: Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barskiy, Grigoriy Aleksandrov\nGenres: Docudrama, Period drama, Historical Epic, Propaganda,Thriller, War",
