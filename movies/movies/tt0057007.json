      "description": "The John Ford / John Wayne team created a South Seas comedy with \" Donovan's Reef \" Producer and film director John Ford once again demonstrates his talent for successful, wild romantic comedies with this action-packed John Wayne classic.   Life on a South Pacific island is almost perfect for two ex-Navy friends ( John Wayne and Lee Marvin ) - they spend most of their time arguing and fighting in the local saloon, Donovan's Reef. This somehow manages to ward off the monotony of tropical life. One day, Elizabeth Allen , a cool-headed beauty from Boston, bursts into the scene searching for her father.",
