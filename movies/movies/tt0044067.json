      "description": "St. Benny the Dip is blessed with a marvelous cast. Dick Haymes, Lionel Stander, and Cosmo Topper himself, Roland Young, play a trio of small time hoodlums who disguise themselves as priests to escape a police dragnet. Finding themselves in an abandoned Bowery mission, the threesome take their masquerade to extremes, holding services and feeding the poor. This marvelous tale of redemption also stars a luminous Nina Foch as love interest and Freddie Bartholomew in his final screen appearance. This is perhaps the first and so far only noir-comedy ever made, with some very fine black and white location photography by Don Malkames,",

      "description": "Benny (Dick Haymes), Monk (Lionel Stander) and Matthew (Roland Young) are three small-time crooks trying to escape a police dragnet in New York City. After hiding in a church and taking minister's suits and dog collars, they emerge, dressed as priests, and find shelter in an abandoned Bowery mission. When beat cops mistake them for real ministers sent to restore the soup kitchen, they're forced to go along with repairs, holding services and feeding the poor. They have to decide whether to stay, steal the mission money and run; or, change their lives. Like the Priest allowing Jean Valjean to escape, in Les Misérables, it's the first time they've been treated with respect, and had a chance to do some good work, for awhile. The question is whether the police detectives or junior priests will turn them in before they even have a chance.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Edgar G. Ulmer, produced by Edward J. Danziger and Harry Lee Danziger, written by George Auerbach (story) and John Roeburt (writer), starring Dick Haymes as Benny, Nina Foch as Linda Kovacs, Roland Young as Matthew, Lionel Stander as Monk Williams, Freddie Bartholomew as Reverend Wilbur, Oskar Karlweis as Mr. Kovacs, William A. Lee as Police Sergeant Monahan, Dick Gordon as Reverend Miles, Jean Casto as Mrs. Mary Williams, Eddie Wells as Patrolman McAvoy and James Bender as House Detective.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"St. Benny the Dip\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
