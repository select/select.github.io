      "description": "Anup writes for a newspaper, and his sister is invited to a girl's birthday party by her rich friend Gopa. After she leaves the party, accused of being a thief, Gopa comes to the house to apologize and meets Anup. He refuses her personal apology, saying it's a societal problem. Anup's boss sends him to a rich official's office who needs a speech written. This man is Rajendra, brother of Gopa and husband of the birthday girl. The speech Anup writes goes well, so Rajendra steals Anup's manuscript for a novel and publishes it under his own name. Rajendra is praised for his insight into the issue of poverty, but the workers at his company go on strike. Anup and Rajendra's sister Gopa, support the striking workers, but his paid goons squelch the strike. Disillusioned by the hypocrisy, Gopa leaves her comfortable wealth behind to be with Anup.",
