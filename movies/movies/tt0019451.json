      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Winner of the first Academy Award for Best Art Direction, Tempest followed a Russian peasant who becomes a lieutenant in the army. Bureaucracy and a failed romance with a princess lands him in prison, but his story is not finished there. Reviews and box office from the time of release were not noted, though modern audiences enjoy John Barrymore in the starring role. This version had the best picture quality by far, but used a newer soundtrack and was slightly longer than other versions. I made a couple quick changes to the audio track and now the (mostly) original soundtrack works with this higher quality version. ",
