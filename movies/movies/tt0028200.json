      "description": "I was annoyed that files derived from this movie lost audio after 17 minutes of play, so that it was necessary to download or play the 3.8 GB MPEG-2 file. The Internet Archive tried to re-derive MPEG-1 and MPEG-4 files from it to fix this audio problem to no avail. I had better luck. The 1.02 GB MPEG-4 file listed was derived from the original MPEG-2 file using settings near the limit of the MPEG-4 codec and deinterlaced. Enjoy! IMDb",
