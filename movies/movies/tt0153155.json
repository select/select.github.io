    "Plot": "Young Tom, a piper himself, helps out other characters from nursery rhymes in this particularly charming Terrytoon.There seem to be some changes in the uncredited art department. the character designs have been simplified a bit and the animation is cleaner than in earlier Terrytoons; whoever animated the pig had not only been paying attention in class and while looking at Disney's the THREE LITTLE PIGS the previous year. The unnamed artists were moving away from the rubber-hose animation that had dominated much of the industry for the last ten years.Philip Scheib's musical score is likewise cleaner. Although there is some choral work and a small orchestra in the background, this cartoon is about a young piper, so that's how the melody is carried. The result is a very pleasant little cartoon for the era.",
