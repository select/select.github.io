    "Plot": "Estranged for years since a devastating and horrible tragedy back in 1964, siblings Adam and Jake reunite once again when unexpectedly, the former receives an emergency phone call from his brother informing him that their widowed mother Evette has been inexplicably missing for days. Without delay, Adam troubled by the alarming news, returns to his hometown with his wife Beth and baby Emma, only to be awkwardly welcomed with open arms by the pervading members of the local cult-like bereavement group called \"Gateways\" and their rather cryptic guru leader Lawrence. Undoubtedly, there is more than meets the eye, moreover, as the two brothers search for answers in the secretive neighbourhood, at the same time, the dark presence of a grim and haunting spectre seems to be strongly attracted by infant Emma's innocence. Is there a chance of eluding the malignant otherworldly visitor?",
