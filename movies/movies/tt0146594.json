    "Plot": "Cubby Bear embarks on a world flight to much fanfare, including the Four Marx Brothers as Boy Scouts. Even Charles Lindbergh comes to see him off. Although Cubby barely makes it off the ground, he crosses most of the conterminous United States before tunneling through the earth to China. Cubby flies over Germany, where he is toasted by President Paul von Hindenburg, Chancellor Adolf Hitler, and a third Nazi (Joachim von Ribbentrop?) In France, a statue of Napoleon comes to life, morphs into Maurice Chevalier, and serenades Cubby. Over the Atlantic, his plane is repeatedly struck by lightning, but he flies literally by the seat of his pants and lands on the Statue of Liberty, where he is hailed by New Yorkers and King Kong.",
