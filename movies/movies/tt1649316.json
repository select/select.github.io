    "Plot": "This Alice Guy film shows some rocks being pounded by the waves right off shore. There are a variety of angles, and raises the question of why this movie was shot at all.I believe this is the last of the 'rough seas' genre of early movies. ROUGH SEA AT DOVER (1895) by Birt Acres &amp; Robert Paul may be the earliest motion picture in the group, although one of the preceding technologies offered a view of rough waters; and I imagine photographic studies were made earlier on. You can probably see antecedents in paintings like J.M.William Turner's THE SHIPWRECK.This does not mean, of course, that images of rough seas have vanished from the movies. They still appear as individual shots, when appropriate, to this day.",
