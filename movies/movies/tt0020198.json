      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The Mysterious Island, based on the 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas series by Jules Verne, is an early mostly-silent science fiction film. The budget for the film was fairly large, and especially for a mostly untested genre like science fiction. Unfortunately, the film was a massive financial flop, which likely deterred studios from exploring the genre for at least a few years.",
