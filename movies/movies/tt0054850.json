      "description": "\"Hercules in the Haunted World\" is a 1961 Italian film directed by the renowned filmmaker Mario Bava . Known as \"Ercole al centro della Terra\" in Italian, this film blends the sword-and-sandal genre with elements of fantasy and horror, creating a unique viewing experience. In this adventure, Hercules, portrayed by Reg Park , embarks on a perilous journey to rescue his beloved Princess Deianira (played by Leonora Ruffo ), who has fallen into a catatonic state due to a curse. Deianira's uncle, King Lico (played by Christopher Lee ), usurps the throne, leading Hercules to consult the oracle Medea for guidance. She instructs him to retrieve the Stone of Forgetfulness from the Underworld to save her. To access Hades, Hercules must obtain the Golden Apple from the Land of the Hesperides, leading to a series of adventures filled with mythological challenges.",
