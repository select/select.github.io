      "description": "This film has a lovely calming atmosphere while we travel on an old tow barge from the town of Edam to Volendam in The Netherlands nearly a century ago in 1931. It was the last trip of this means of transport and filmed probably for that reason. A tow barge is a historic ship that was pulled from the shore and carried freight and passengers. The tow barge was one of the forerunners of modern public transport: the barge took everyone who was willing to pay the fixed fare. There were sometimes several classes available with more or less luxury. Tow barges were already in use as early as in 1561. William of Orange was said to have travelled on such a barge across the Willebroek to Brussels canal in 1577. The peak in the use of such barges was in the 17th until the beginning of the 19th century.  Hardened tow paths were constructed along many canals in The Netherlands to allow horses to pull the barges. Once the ordinary muddy inland roads were replaced by roads with hardened surfaces, the diligence coaches became the popular means of transport and the use of tow barges started to decline. Men of some reputation would only take a tow barge if there was no other, better means of transportation. The opening of railroads and emergence of steam boats in the second half of the 19th century gave the tow barge business the final blow. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, restored, enhanced and colorized with modern A.I. video software. The gossiping elderly ladies and the helmsman in the film are dressed in traditional Volendam costume. They are probably talking about their disapproval of the young couple who also are travelling on the tow barge. Source: Beeld En Geluid Music: Trevor Kowalski, Howard Harper-Barnes a.o. ",
