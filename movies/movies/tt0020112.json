      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The Love Parade was a massive box office hit for Paramount Studios, and is one of the main reasons the studio was able to survive through the depression. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, although it won zero, and has nine songs that are unique to the picture. The comedy covers the marital problems of a queen and her consort, and audiences of the time were enraptured by the escapism.  Sourced from \"PizzaFlix\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF29AkLjYio",
