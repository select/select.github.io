Starring the irresistible Maurice Chevalier and the radiant Jeanette MacDonald.\n\nIn the fictional kingdom of Sylvania—famous for its light bulbs and bargain-priced electronics—the royal cabinet is in turmoil: their Queen (MacDonald) remains unmarried. Meanwhile, Sylvania’s dashing emissary to France (Chevalier) finds himself recalled in disgrace, thanks to a string of scandalous romances. But rather than punishment, he’s met with an unexpected proposition—the Queen invites him to put his legendary prowess to the test.\n\nFeaturing elegant pre-Code humor, suggestive double entendres, and dazzling musical numbers, this early Hollywood talkie is a prime example of the era’s risqué storytelling before the Production Code took over.\n\nAlso featuring Lupino Lane in a scene-stealing comic performance, The Love Parade (1929) is a classic musical filled with glamorous 1920s fashion, sumptuous Art Deco sets, and unforgettable melodies.

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The Love Parade was a massive box office hit for Paramount Studios, and is one of the main reasons the studio was able to survive through the depression. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, although it won zero, and has nine songs that are unique to the picture. The comedy covers the marital problems of a queen and her consort, and audiences of the time were enraptured by the escapism.  Sourced from \"PizzaFlix\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF29AkLjYio",
