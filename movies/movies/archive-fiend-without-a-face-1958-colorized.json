      "description": "An American airbase in Canada provokes resentment among the locals concerned about fallout from its nuclear power plant. After a man's mysterious death, his sister (Kim Parker) leads the military investigator (Marshall Thompson) to suspect that experiments by an elderly British scientist (Kynaston Reeves) have unleashed an invisible killer that sucks the brains out of its victims. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
