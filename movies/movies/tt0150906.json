    "Plot": "The doctor comes rushing over, with many an accident and point of view shot. Krazy Kat has been hiccuping for, well, forever. Is he going to set a new record? Like many of the KK cartoons in this period, it winds up with the Doctor hitting Krazy with a bung starter and the Kat hallucinating.... this time that he is in Madison Square Garden, going for the record with a huge crowd in attendance.It's been some decades since hiccoughs gave me any problems, but I recall their annoyance, and this one plays with its fantasies in a very engaging manner. I do find it odd that when Krazy hiccoughs here, he goes \"ah....choo!\"",
