    "Plot": "In front of a landscape littered with churches and wind mills, Krazy Kat and Kitty dance in their wooden shoes to a picnic. While eating, they discover the dike is leaking.It looks like Manny Gould and Ben Harrison told their staff \"throw in as many Dutch stereotypes as you can,\" whereupon they proceeded to do so. The word \"replete\" comes to mind. Every character wears wooden shoes, Krazy wears a sailor's cap, Kitty a lace handkerchief, which I would guess is embroidered, and all the churches have Maltese crosses. Is that a Dutch thing?",
