      "description": "Lausanne, the capital of the Swiss canton of Vaud, is located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, on Lake Geneva. It is the fourth largest city in Switzerland. The city is located at 495 m altitude, in a wine region, and is home to one of the most beautiful Gothic churches in Switzerland. Lausanne is located 62 kilometers northeast of Geneva. In December 2009 the city had 133,280 inhabitants (agglomeration: 324,387), who are called Lausannois. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, interpolated, restored, enhanced and colorized by means of A.I. video software.
