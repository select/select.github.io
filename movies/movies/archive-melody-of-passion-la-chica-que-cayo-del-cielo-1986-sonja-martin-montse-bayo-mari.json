      "description": "A Munich student (Sonja Martin) inherits a castle in Mallorca from her aunt What she does not know is that her aunt's lawyer of the deceased has converted the castle into a luxury brothel. Sadly, I don't have a better version of this film, hopefully someone does. Still it is better than nothing though it is considerably shorter than the 80 minutes original run time. There are burned in Japanese (?) subtitles and those were likely added at the same time the extra footage was cut.",
