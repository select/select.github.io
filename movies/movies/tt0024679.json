      "description": "A murderer, known as \"The Black Ace\", menaces a number of people staying in an old dark mansion. This 1933 picture features matinee idol Chester Morris as an author intent on writing a book about the notorious criminal. He visits criminal expert Thornton Drake to get more information about the case. When someone receives the killer's calling card (the \"ace of spades\") the mystery begins. This is a wonderfully entertaining old fashioned mystery movie with all the hallmarks - an old house, servants, guests, a dashing hero, some bumbling detectives and a murderer among them.",
