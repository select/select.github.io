      "description": "Welcome back for another warm night of creepy fun at the good old Shocker Internet Drive! Tonight we proudly present a Roger Corman double feature. Though it is open for debate, we think these are two of the master director's best movies. Grab your munchies from the snack bar and enjoy a bite with Aldry in \"The Little Shop of Horrors\" and then finish out the night with a little bit of art in \"A Bucket of Blood\". Of course we tempt you with the usual trailers, advertisements and a wonderfully racy Tex Avery cartoon. So snuggle up in the back (or front) seat, turn the speaker volume up loud and allow the low budget magic of Roger Corman to bewilder your imagination!
