      "description": "A wonderful flight with a Fokker F.VII aircraft, registration number H-NACT over the city of Arnhem in The Netherlands in 1926. This film has been restored and colorized with Artificial Intelligence software. Arnhem is well known the World-over for in particular its role during WWII. Many viewers will have seen the famous movie \"A Bridge Too Far\" with among other Sean Connery and many other stars. The river can be seen in this film, as it was nearly 20 years before the end of WWII. This original N-HACT was destroyed at Schiphol airport during the German assult at the beginning of WWII. After the war a similar aircraft was bought (from Sweden?) and re-named N-HACT. It can still be seen in the Aviodome museum (to be confirmed). At the beginning the pilot can be seen smoking a cigarette before getting his aircraft ready for the flight. Subsequently the film shows the old town and views of the bridges over the river Rhine.
