He thinks his day has the possibility of looking up when he spots Mildred, the girl of his dreams, on a date at the park with Roy. Harold thinks he can take Mildred away from Roy. Harold does whatever he can to impress Mildred, while putting Roy in a bad light. Ultimately, Mildred, who has two tickets for a romantic hot air balloon ride, says that she will take that ride with whoever can get the approval from her mother to do so first. Harold gets into one misadventure after another in the entire process, which includes being in possession of a stolen purse, which he is unaware belongs to Mildred and which contains the two tickets.",
