    "Plot": "It is not uncommon for this German count to suffer acute indigestion after a typically colossal dinner and in consequence to have an equally colossal aristocratic nightmare. However, even the most unnerving aristocratic bad dream can't be compared with the one suffered by Herr Asmus ( Herr Otto Werther ) a poor Teutonic farmer, as is depicted in the bizarre and disturbing silent film \"Die Teufelskirche\" ( The Devil's Church ), directed by Herr Hans Mierendorff in the silent year of 1919.In a prologue and four acts ( the prologue and the first act are lost so is necessary to describe what happens with some title cards ) the film depicts the terrible dream of Asmus wherein the devil ( Herr Paul Rehkopf ) joins the human world disguised as a tinker. He meets Frau Ane ( Frau Agnes Straub ), Asmus' wife; Ane yearns to have a baby but in vain so the devil takes advantage of Frau Ane's motherly inner desire by making a deal with her but for his own purposes. As a result, the farmer's wife comes under the devil's spell and then seduces the local priest ( Herr Hans Mierendorff ), giving the devil to chance to build his own church to replace the old church that has burned down.The atmosphere of this unclassifiable and exceptional silent film is all doom and gloom and, though not really an Expressionist film (in spite of many traces here and there), there are many shocking scenes, especially when Satan takes over the church and seduces Ane, his most innocent victim. The latter sequence is erotic and even today bold and shocking. Good and evil, temptations and desires, pleasure, sin, lust and greed are given their due in a feverish hallucination full of turmoil. Indeed, even Herr Gott himself appears and finds he can't enter the devil's church and is even rejected by the parishioners. This is a world turned upside down, ja wohl!.... But in the end it is all a dream and there is brightness and relief when Herr Asmus wakes up and finds he still has his beloved wife and his farm.Appropriately, the movie was produced by \"Lucifer Films\"!! Certainly this Herr Graf would like to watch more films produced by such a sacrilegious film company. The copy viewed by this Herr von at the Schloss theater was on the blurry side and was edited by the late folk music scholar and silent film expert Herr Leslie Shepard to whom this Herr Graf owes a lot because his silent film archives were full of treasures which he was willing to share with silent film fans around the world. Some day many of these will be properly restored.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must avoid colossal dinners from now on.",
