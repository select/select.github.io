      "description": "Here is a lost treasure from 1950 that has never seen any release on video and was found off of a recording from American Movie Classics in the early 1990s. Aired during the run of the original Goldbergs television sitcom (not to be confused with the 2010s ABC sitcom about life in the 1980s), much of the cast from the series starred in perhaps the first feature film based off of a television series based off of a middle-class Jewish family living in a Bronx apartment with typical problems of the mid-20th century. Molly, the starring role was a typical housewife that especially liked the chat with her neighbors and always looked to be a problem solver to her neighbors. Jake (Philip Loeb) was the working father, while Sammy (Larry Robinson) and Rosalie (Arlene McQuade) were typical clean-cut teenagers of the era. Uncle David (Eli Mintz) was the smart godfather and patriarch.",
