      "title": "One Exciting Night (1922) | Colorized Public Domain Silent Mystery Thriller by D.W. Griffith",
      "description": "One Exciting Night (1922) is a silent mystery-thriller directed and produced by D.W. Griffith, one of early Hollywood’s most influential filmmakers. This restored and colorized public domain edition revives Griffith’s haunted-house suspense tale, which combines murder, comedy, and supernatural atmosphere. With its mix of intrigue, stormy set-pieces, and dramatic staging, the film reflects Griffith’s experimentation during the post–World War I silent era.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe story begins with Agnes Harrington (Carol Dempster), who discovers after her wealthy uncle’s death that she is the rightful heir to a large fortune. However, her inheritance is contested by distant relatives, leading to rising tensions over money and family loyalty. As the heirs gather in a large country mansion on a stormy night, strange events unfold — including mysterious figures lurking in the shadows, unexpected murders, and hints of supernatural forces at play.\n\nRomance intertwines with suspense when Agnes finds herself drawn to John Fairfax (Henry Hull), a young man caught in the chaos of greed and suspicion. As the storm outside intensifies, the group is trapped in the house, where betrayal, fear, and violent confrontations mount. Griffith stages a dramatic climax with lightning, torrential rain, and heightened tension, pushing silent-era special effects to new levels of spectacle.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: D.W. Griffith\n• Producer: D.W. Griffith\n• Story: D.W. Griffith\n• Cinematography: G.W. Bitzer (Griffith’s longtime collaborator)\n\nStarring:\n• Carol Dempster as Agnes Harrington\n• Henry Hull as John Fairfax\n• Porter Strong as Simeon Marlowe\n• Margaret Dale as Aunt Hetty\n• Morgan Wallace as Jasper Marlowe\n• Frank Sheridan as Judge Harrington\n• Charles Emmett Mack as Harry Harrington\n• Charles Hill Mailes as Detective\n\nFilm Significance:\nOne Exciting Night represents Griffith’s attempt to capitalize on the popularity of haunted-house mysteries of the early 1920s. While not considered his greatest work, the film is important historically as one of Griffith’s later productions, showing his ability to adapt to popular trends while still applying his mastery of suspense and large-scale effects.\n\nThe film is also notable for Carol Dempster’s leading role, as she was Griffith’s protégé and frequent star during this period. Its use of weather effects, dark shadows, and gothic mansion staging reflects a cinematic style that foreshadowed later Hollywood thrillers and horror films. Though critics at the time gave it mixed reviews, it remains a fascinating example of Griffith’s late silent career and an engaging piece of cinematic history.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
