    "Plot": "A fine magician of the Royal Court--master of trickery and illusion--takes great care to prove that the transparent glass container in front of him is absolutely empty. With his mystical power and a single fan, the great conjurer manages to materialise an elegant attire--and much to our amazement--a refined dandy appears. But that's not all. From the depths of this tiny box, yet another costume clothes a lifeless mannequin, as an ornate palanquin is summoned. Now, what does the illusionist have in mind?",
