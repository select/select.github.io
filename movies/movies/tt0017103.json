      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of Rex Ingram's strangest films, The Magician was thought to be lost for decades before being rediscovered. At the time, it was uncommon to find horror films that were not at least partially comedic. In the picture, a woman is injured in an accident. Upon recovering, an occultist begins to stalk and obsess over her. Contemporary reviews felt that the film was tasteless and risqué, thought modern viewers enjoy the cinematography and that supernatural horror plays a role in the plot.  I've uploaded two versions with their own soundtracks, though it seems as if one of the copies may have been upscaled at some point to the detriment of its details.",
