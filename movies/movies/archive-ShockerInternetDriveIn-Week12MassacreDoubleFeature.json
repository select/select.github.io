      "description": "Hello and welcome back! Well, after taking a couple months off to remodel the Snack Bar, put up some new speakers, and repaint the big screen, our little drive in is back open for the summer! And - by popular demand - we are proud to bring you the that 1976 classic of low budget fun \"Drive In Massacre\"! In addition to a classic \"Popeye\" cartoon and the usual Snack Bar plugs, we are also presenting \"Panic\" another low budget wonder from the 1970's that takes the 1950's theme of a scientist who turns himself into a monster to a whole new tired level. So grab your partner, popcorn, and soda pop - snuggle up and turn the speaker up and enjoy the show!
