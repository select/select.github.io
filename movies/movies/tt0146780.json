    "Plot": "That's the set up on this 1939 black &amp; white Terrytoon. The drawings are pretty elaborate and some of the jokes are quite good, but it's the same set of gags as in ALPINE ANTICS and FROZEN FROLICS from a decade earlier, and that's just a little much for me. Some attempts to vary the gags are essayed by casting the entire thing as a narrated travelogue -- I am uncertain who did them for Fox, but undoubtedly they had their own line, and the piece is narrated in the sort of droning, emphatic voice that Knox Manning used at Warner's and James A. Fitzpatrick used at Metro.Terry tried to revive the Irish character in 1956 as \"Phoney Baloney.\"",
