The Lion has an upright piano, and plays a bit though a fly keeps bothering him. Krazy has a grand piano, and plays a little too, but soon it's between rounds, and all four competitors (the pianos are living creatures also) are exhausted. Then the pianos go at it alone in a punch out, Krazy and the victorious Grand start a spirited playing of \"St. Louis Blues\", and the Lion and Upright join in as well. All take a bow at the end.",
