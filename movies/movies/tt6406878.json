    "Plot": "It's freezing cold on the outskirts of town. Yet people gather. We watch them form a row across the horizon. We all wait for something to happen. However, nothing does - We have been assembled to witness an event. To participate in being seen. The spectacle of watching and being watched. NOTHING HAPPENS is both a cinematic and Virtual Reality experience which questions the role of the spectator, by inviting the individual to participate in an event. The film is an observation and an invitation for contemplation while VR allows us to choose our perspective, allows us to dwell on the details and absorb the unique atmosphere. The project explores a new kind of narrative, a new way of being in a painting, a work of art that is truly comprehensive and immersive. NOTHING HAPPENS offers a new way of looking. It is about spectatorship, about watching and being watched. It is about being present.",
