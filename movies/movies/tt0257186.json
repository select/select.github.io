      "description": "This is a compilation of three prints from the Paper Print collection of the Library of Congress produced by American Mutoscpe and Biograph in 1906. I have added music and sharpened the title. The story is inconsequential but the scenes of the workers on the high beams are fascinating in those days before special effects, there is even a fight, and remember the cameraman and a bulky camera had to be there too. Enjoy the lovely Victorian gesture of the little girl at the end as she points to the culprit. Enjoy.",
