      "description": "Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd) is leading an archaeological expedition through part of California, but some Chinese are tryig to stop it because they have a hidden settlement nearby. Outlaw Slade Salters (Douglas Fowley) and his gang are also in the area looking for a gold mine. In an attack by Salters' men, the gold mine is found. Hoppy agrees to file a claim for the Chinese and heads after Salters in a chase to the land office. With Andy Clyde as California Carlson, Brad King as Johnny Nelson, and introducing Barbara Britton as Jennifer Kendall. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
