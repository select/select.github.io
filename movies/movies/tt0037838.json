Americans Bob Elliott (Edward Norris) and Chuck Kelly (Eddie Quillan) arrive to help the British agents. Lothel (Ruth Roman), the mysterious Queen of the Jungle, appears and disappears always in the nick of time to save them, and also Pam Courtney (Lois Collier), niece of the explorer Alan Courtney ('Boyd Irwin' (q)). Dr. Elise Bork (Tala Birell) and her henchman Lang (Douglass Dumbrille) are the Nazi chiefs, posing as scientists. Lang has great influence on some of the tribesman, especially with Chief Maata (Napoleon Simpson') who wants to keep Kyba (Clarence Muse) from becoming judge over all the tribes. A Secret Sword is the key to the ruler of the jungles, and the holder of this secret is sought by both the British and the Nazis. Courtney is the only white man who knows the secret but is killed before he can reveal it to his niece Pamela. The forces of good finally prevail in Chapter 13, \"The Secret of the Sword!\", through the help of Lotel, who disappears in the same sheet of flame that has marked her coming and going.",
