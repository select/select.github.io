Lang has great influence on some of the tribesman, especially with Chief Maata (Napoleon Simpson') who wants to keep Kyba (Clarence Muse) from becoming judge over all the tribes. A Secret Sword is the key to the ruler of the jungles, and the holder of this secret is sought by both the British and the Nazis. Courtney is the only white man who knows the secret but is killed before he can reveal it to his niece Pamela.
