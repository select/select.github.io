      "description": "\"Rocketship X-M\" is a 1950 black-and-white science fiction film directed by Kurt Neumann, telling the story of a crew on a mission to the Moon who accidentally land on Mars and discover remnants of a destroyed Martian civilization. The story centers on a group of astronauts who are aboard a rocketship named X-M . As the crew prepares for their journey, they face various challenges and personal tensions. Upon taking off, the crew encounters a severe problem: a meteor shower damages their ship, pushing them off course towards Mars instead of their intended destination. With limited resources and time, they must work together to navigate this crisis. Once they reach Mars, they discover a desolate world, initially believing it to be uninhabited. However, their explorations lead to an encounter with Martian inhabitants, revealing the potential consequences of human presence and intervention on alien soil.",
