      "description": "Texel is a beautiful Dutch island in the North West of The Netherlands. It is part of the so-called \"Wadden\" islands that consist of Texel, Vlievand, Terschelling, Ameland, Schiermonnikoog en Rottumeroog. It is a popular holiday destination for Dutch and also German people because it has a lot to offer: beaches, woods and wonderful nature. It is an ornitologists paradise because of the many bird species that flock together and breed on the island. The island can only be reached by ferry that is run by the TESO company since 1907. One of todays new (huge) ferries still bares the same name as the one shown in this film: \"Dokter Wagemaker\". This nearly 80 year old film shows Texel's splendor through the eyes of famous Dutch biologist Dr.Jac.P.Thijsse who also briefly appears in this film on board the ferry from Den Helder to Texel. He was also the co-author of the \"Flora\", a unique Dutch book that contains a simple procedure to determine the name of almost any plant, flower, bush or scrub. It was used by many schools. Basically this is a nature film, but it also shows Texels main four towns as they were nearly 80 years ago: Den Burgh, Oude Schild, Den Hoorn and De Koog as well as many picturesq villages. Although the film was shot in 1943 there is no trace of any WW-II activities. The original, rather poor quality, B&W film (in 6 parts) has been meticulously motion-stabilized, enhanced and colorized by means of the latest artificial intelligence software. The sound track has also been restored. Music: Original sound track with Dutch commentary Source: Beeld En Geluid.",
