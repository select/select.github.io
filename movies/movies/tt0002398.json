    "Plot": "Gladys simply could not make her eyes behave, and whenever she flashed them on a member of the stronger sex, from that moment he was her abject slave. Her papa often reprimanded her for what he called flirting. But the poor girl could not help being vain of the power of her luminous orbs, and exercised this to the limit. However, when her father finds his clerks wildly fascinated, he decides to help them teach her a lesson, with what result the picture shows.",
