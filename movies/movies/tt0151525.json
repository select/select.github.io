    "Plot": "A bulldog is shocked to see a cat bring some Swiss cheese to a mouse, not to trap him, but as a gesture of affection. The cat and mouse dance together, as the bulldog declares the whole thing unnatural. Finally, the mouse decides he wants to do something nice for the cat. He demands that the cat eat him. The cat goes through the motions of boiling the mouse (over a stove he has turned off). He puts the mouse on a plate and salts him; but just before he takes his first bite, he breaks the plate and laughs. He could never eat the mouse. His goal in life is to be friends with the whole world. The bulldog is inspired. He decides he wants to be friends with the whole world, too. As his first step, he brings a gift to an irascible goat: a boot on a plate. The results of his first and only attempt at magnanimity are disastrous.",
