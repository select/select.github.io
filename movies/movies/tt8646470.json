      "description": "*Silent As The Grave* - Chris, an obsessive documentary filmmaker, battles powerful unknown forces as he investigates his Uncle Edgar's mysterious death, a tragedy that has plagued his family for decades. In 1960, teenager Edgar Williams was killed in a freight elevator accident while at work... at least that's what everyone was led to believe. But if that's true, why has someone been secretly placing flowers on his grave for all these years? Could it be his death was a cover up? If so, why? Who can be trusted? As Chris sets out to solve the mystery that has affected his relationship with his mother since childhood, he risks his life to uncover the truth and deliver justice for his uncle, once and for all.\n2023.
