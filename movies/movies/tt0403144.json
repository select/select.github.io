    "Plot": "This fairly typical late silent Paul Terry cartoon is about hunting, as Farmer Gray and the cat go riding camelback for dinosaur, lions, monkeys and squirrels. It is a little livelier than usual as instead of using the shotgun, the farmer teaches the dinosaur to play fetch a la Gertie and cavorts with the monkeys.Clearly Terry is already aiming his cartoons for very small children, but certainly the playfulness of the entire operation raise this above his norm so it is still highly watchable -- a bit of a stretch for Terry who stayed in business for many years by running a cheap operation in which he fit his budgets to his contracts with Fox and his stories for four-year-olds. But, as I have already said, here it works.",
