      "description": "“An amusing farce” “As fluffy as Marie’s hair” (IMDB reviews quotes). A breezy marital comedy in which newlywed Marie Prevost tests her husband’s fidelity by disguising herself with a blonde wig. This completely fools everybody. (Yeah I know. It’s really far-fetched.) Good cast and good production values. So suspend your power of disbelief and have fun. IMDB 6.5. Directed by E Mason Hopper and F McGrew Willis. Released in 1920. Complete print?",
