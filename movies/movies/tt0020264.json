    "Plot": "Plans for a nice Sunday picnic seemed doomed even before Stanley and Oliver and their families get into the car. First the boys get into a fight and destroy all the sandwiches. Then the car itself keeps acting up, requiring repeated exits and reboardings by the boys, their wives and grouchy, gout-ridden Uncle Edgar. A brick-throwing tiff with a neighbor threatens to escalate into general mayhem until the local parson strolls by. They finally manage to get underway, steering toward an innocent-looking mud puddle in the street.",
