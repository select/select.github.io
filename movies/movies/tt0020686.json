      "description": "The Big House is a significant American pre-Code prison drama film directed by George W. Hill and features a notable cast including Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Lewis Stone, and Robert Montgomery. The story revolves around Kent Marlowe (Robert Montgomery), a young man sentenced to ten years for manslaughter after a drunk driving incident. He finds himself in an overcrowded prison, where he shares a cell with two dominant inmates: Butch (Wallace Beery), a violent career criminal, and Morgan (Chester Morris), who tries to help Kent navigate prison life. The film explores themes of survival, betrayal, and the harsh realities of incarceration. The Big House is considered one of the first influential prison films, setting the stage for many that followed. It is noted for its realistic portrayal of prison life and character-driven narrative, making it a classic in the genre. The film's impact is still recognized today, influencing later works in cinema.",
