      "description": "PMF 5019 // Documentary by American filmmaker John Huston. Huston served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II. Intended to educate the public about PTSD and its treatment among returning veterans, the film's unscripted presentation of mental disability led to \"Let There Be Light\" being suppressed by the U.S. government.  Wasn't officially released until 1980.",
