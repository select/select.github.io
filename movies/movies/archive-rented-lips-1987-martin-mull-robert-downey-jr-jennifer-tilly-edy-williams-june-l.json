      "description": "Martin Mull's attempt at big movie making with lots of help from Robert Downey Sr. Not the best film, Mull, like a lot of comics, just did not quite have what it takes to be a lead character in a movie. Still it is an enjoyable film with enough semi-famous actors to make it worth viewing.  This is a low res copy of the film but is the best I have been able to find.",
