      "description": "Watch Theodore Roosevelt's rich and active life during his presidency from 1901 to 1909 and thereafter until his death in 1919. The film consists of many fragments showing his inauguration in 1901, speeches, visit to San Francisco in 1903, with his 'Rough Riders' as well as his funeral in 1919. The quality of the footage is very high due to the painstaking restoration, enhancement and colorization by means of A.I. software.",
