      "description": "A devious fox comes to a small farm and uses flattery to trick the ducks, chickens and roosters into coming with him, supposedly to compete at the County Fair. Dinky is desperate to come along, too, but the fox rejects the little black duck for the same reason all the other farm birds shun him: he's too small. Dinky, however, discovers that the fox has tricked all the birds into his cave. The fox has them caged and plans to roast them in his oven. It's up to the once-despised Dinky to come to the rescue.
