    "Plot": "Albers, as Sergeant Berry der Gangster shrek der Chicago, patrols urban streets where blacks play jazz, shoots it out with criminals and leads a night club raid.So impressive is our genial hero, that he is sent off to catch dope smugglers in Mexico - an elaborate studio built village, tree cactus in the desert and a two storey hotel for the camera to track through.Hans gets to juggle a knife, skinny dip, shoot the Mexican heavy in the rump and start the cantina dance. He wins the villain's financée, even if our hero's grey haired mum, second billed von Bukovics, flies in, which might have spooked most potential romances.Good pacing, and a breezy performance by our hero to go with accomplished, smallish scale production. Albers' adventure films are an unexpected element of the thirties scene - complete with the approval they give the US Consul etc.",
