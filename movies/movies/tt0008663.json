Victor Seastrom is both the leading star of the film and its director. He was successful in his native Sweden before making a career in the USA in 1924-1930.  His Hollywood films are still copyrighted, this is why we show you films from his previous years. A sailor tries to bring food to his starving family by breaking through a naval blockade, but is captured. The enemy captain ignores his pleas and he is put in jail for years. Upon his return he is heartbroken to learn that his family did not survive. Then when a ship is wrecked during a storm the sailor rushes to help, but is astonished to find that same former captain fighting for his life. The sailor now has a chance for revenge.
