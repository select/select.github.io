      "description": "In Tiger Bay, the docklands of Cardiff, rough-and-tumble street urchin Gillie witnesses the brutal killing of a young woman at the hands of visiting Polish sailor Korchinsky.

When Detective Graham discovers that Gillie has the murder weapon, the fiery young girl weaves a web of lies to throw him off course. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/tiger-bay-1959/",
