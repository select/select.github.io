      "description": "“A scientist invents a serum that keeps a dog's head alive after its body dies. When the scientist dies of a heart attack, his crazed assistant cuts off his head and, using the serum, keeps the doctor's head alive and forces it to help him on an experiment to give his hunchbacked nurse assistant a new body.”(imdb.com) Imaginatively titled for US release as “The Head,” this older German cousin of “The Brain That Wouldn’t Die” is also known as “Die Nackte und der Satan” (“The Naked and the Satan”).  Curiously, the two films share some aspects -- decapitation, a full-body transplant, strippers, a disembodied head that speaks without lungs, All dialogue is in dubbed English. My source was flat and gray, so I boosted the contrast a bit before uploading. Research by oldbones indicates this movie is PD.",
