      "description": "This spectacular colourized film tells the story of every-day life in London (UK) nearly a century ago. All familiar sights and points of interest get attention in this film. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, enhanced, upscaled and colourized by means of state-of-the-art video software. Please just enjoy this old film footage and REFRAIN from any comments about the influx of other nationals into the UK since this film was made. Plenty of comments in this respect have already been made and there is nothing more to add. By all means share your own experiences, or that of your (grand) parents, of what it was like to live in London just before the second world war. I fully understand the sentiments that old film footage like this awakens, but please use other, more appropriate means to voice your concerns about present day circumstances. Most of the time I cannot monetize my work on Youtube mainly due to the use of particular, best suitable music as well as Youtube erroneously qualifying what I do as \"re-used content\". If you like my work and wish to DONATE then please goto: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/Rick88888888",
