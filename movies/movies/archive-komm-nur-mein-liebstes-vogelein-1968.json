      "description": "Another pseudo documentary on sex through the ages. It features a fair bit of archive footage and ends with a Terry Gilliam style of animation. Probably most notable for being Sybil Danning's first movie appearance.  Unfortunately the resolution of this copy is really low and I was unable to pick her out. Presumably she is one of the many naked background bodies.  German with optional English subtitles",
