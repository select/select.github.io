      "description": "During the early years of film, The Library of Congress secured copyright by having filmmakers print their film negatives outon paper. These paper prints have outlasted later celluloid films which deteriorated quickly. For that reason we have a brief period during the start of movies where we have pretty good reproduction of films of that time. These were usually short primitive realities but oftren very interesting. The LOC digitized these prints and there are availnble for download or purchase at memory/LOCX.gov",
