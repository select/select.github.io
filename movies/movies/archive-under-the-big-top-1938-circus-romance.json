      "description": "Sara Post (Marjorie Main) has molded her niece, Penny (Anne Nagel), into a crowd-pleasing trapeze performer. The main attraction at the circus Sara runs, Penny devotes all of her attention to her art -- until she finds herself being wooed by fellow aerialist Pablo Le Grande (Grant Richards). The rel ationship worries Sara, and it infuriates Pablo's brother, Ricardo (Jack LaRue), who also pines for Penny. If they aren't careful, the rivalry might just lead to the circus's undoing.",
