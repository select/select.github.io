He goes out with his rifle for one last buck, but accidentally shoots someone moving around in the trees. He fearfully goes back to the ranger station and then to town only to see the news of a casino heist with dangerous armed assailants on the loose, including the person he shot. But there is also more than a million dollars missing. He goes back to the body and that's when things get nasty.",
