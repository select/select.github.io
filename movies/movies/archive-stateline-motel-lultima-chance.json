      "description": "Canadian film about the aftermath of a jewel heist with a bit of a twist at the end.  Ursula Andress stars with Barbara Bach in a bit role from early in her career. Rather a low budget offering in the the robbery itself is never shown. Resolution is pretty awful but likely the best there is available (hope I am wrong about this).",
