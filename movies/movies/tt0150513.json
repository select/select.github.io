    "Plot": "At Krazy's farm, he plays piano to spur his animals to produce, but a \"Blind Pig\" appears, producing an outdoor bar, and they all start guzzling booze, with wild results, like a horse drags a plow through the farm, leaving everything in halves, a lamb turns into a lion, a hen lays eggs with bottle shaped chicks. Even Krazy and his piano get drunk, and he mistakenly tries to milk a male donkey.( Off screen, thankfully.)",
