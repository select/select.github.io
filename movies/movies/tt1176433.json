    "Plot": "INTERSTATE (PART ONE) is a night surveillance artifact. Elephants and zebras move in circadian rhythm while tracers from passing automobile traffic flash across the screen in waves. The INTERSTATE project is a series of short video experiments designed around original footage shot at a traveling circus encampment alongside a busy Texas highway. It serves as a critique of popular media practices in the United States-the fetishism of surveillance, the status of detained foreign bodies, the irony of cultural appropriation, and the detached compulsion of witnesses.",
