      "description": "An alien invasion starts with an entity taking possession of the mind of a leading scientist (John Emery), while other scientists (Jeff Morrow, George O'Hanlon, Barbara Lawrence) try to stop the giant energy-absorbing alien machine that is stomping its way across the landscape. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
