      "description": "A mad scientist kidnaps young women and extracts glandular fluid from their bodies to keep his elderly wife alive and young. Bela Lugosi as Dr. Lorenz Luana Walters as Patricia Hunter Tristram Coffin as Dr. Foster Elizabeth Russell as Countess Lorenz Minerva Urecal as Fagah Angelo Rossitto as Toby Joan Barclay as Alice Wentworth I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
