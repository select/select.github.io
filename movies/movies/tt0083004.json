      "description": "Maria Konovalova, a simple but hearty woman from the village, goes to the city to visit her daughter and beloved granddaughter. On the train, she meets a chief engineer of a fish processing factory, also a senior, but a very kind and friendly person. The simple-hearted woman had no idea what kind of life her nearest and dearest had in the city, and perhaps, the only family she had. She soon learns that her daughter does not love her husband, whom she does not live with, although she is not divorced. She doesn’t love her job, which she put herself through just to leave the village. Overall, she doesn’t seem too fond of her life. All of this negatively affects Maria’s granddaughter. Maria tries to establish her daughter’s home and family relationships with absolute directness and the best intentions, bringing much frustration to those close to her.\n\nYear of production: 1981\n\nDirected by: Nikita Mikhalkov\nWritten by: Viktor Merezhko\nDirector of photography: Pavel Lebeshev\nMusic: Eduard Artemyev\nProduction designers: Alexandr Samulekin, Alexandr Adabashyan\nStarring: Nonna Mordyukova, Svetlana Kryuchkova, Fyodor Stukov, Andrei Petrov, Yuri Bogatyryov, Ivan Bortnik",
