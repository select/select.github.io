But when a coworker steals her idea and her boyfriend, Danielle can't help but speak her mind to Vivian and loses her job. Now on the fashion blacklist with no place to go, Danielle heads home to Romania and back to the farm in Transylvania. After the initial culture shock subsides, Danielle begins to find solace with her family and friends. She runs into a charming Brit named Adrian (David Oakes), in town on a business trip, and sparks fly as he helps her discover a passion she left behind; designing her own clothing line. Now with the help of a magazine pal, can Danielle and her Romanian theme clothing line make it at New York Fashion Week?",
