    "Plot": "Very loosely based on Madame Bovary. Jerry is a young doctor with a soft heart who is both gullible and naive. While he's trying to help heal Sheilla's ill father in their family home, his own father, Dr. Daniel Gregory, stops by and confirms there's nothing more that can be done for the patient. After Sheilla's father dies, Jerry reveals he and Sheilla are actually married and eloped without Dan knowing. Disappointed because his son married below his station and broke his engagement to his close friend's daughter, Dan leaves and tells the now ex-fiancee, Jane, what Jerry did. Though Jane is distraught, she isn't angry. Dan brings Sheilla into their family home, and she starts showing dislike for Jerry quickly, despite her much improved circumstances. He's absent a lot, trying to make enough money to move out on his own with her, and between that and Jerry's society not accepting her, Sheilla is determined to find someone who will treat her well, no matter the scandalous nature of their relationship.",
