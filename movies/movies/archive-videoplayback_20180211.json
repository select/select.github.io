      "description": "In swinging 1960s London, 16-year-old high school student Lola (Susan George) does more than simply read the erotic literature penned by 39-year-old American Scott Wardman (Charles Bronson). She tracks down the author and playfully seduces him, to the great consternation of her parents (Paul Ford, K ay Medford) once they learn of the relationship. The unlikely lovebirds eventually get married and wend their way to New York City, but their relationship grows increasingly tenuous.",
