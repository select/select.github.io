Battleship Potemkin is a Soviet epic that is frequently spoken of as one of the greatest films ever created. Certainly as one of the best silent films. It follows the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin as they begin to revolt.",

      "description": "Battleship Potemkin, sometimes rendered as Battleship Potyomkin, is a 1925 Soviet silent epic film produced by Mosfilm.  Directed and co-written by Sergei Eisenstein, it presents a dramatization of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers. The film is a prime example of the Soviet montage theory of editing, such as in the \"Odessa Steps\" scene, which became widely influential and often recreated.",

      "description": "Montage, which was not just Eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. Sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place. Even if one doesn't see all of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (Kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. Some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion",
