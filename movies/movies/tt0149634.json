    "Plot": "Farmer Al Falfa goes tobogganing with chamois. That's how you know this Terrytoon is set in Switzerland and we are going to get a mockumentary on how Swiss Cheese is made.And mice, of course, because you can't have cheese in a cartoon without mice showing up to eat it. The gags are pretty good, even if they have been done before in Terrytoons, because the handling is accompanied by one of Philip Scheib's lively scores, full of his typical string work and piccolo trills. People remember Carl Stalling's work at Disney, Iwerks and best remembered at Warner Brothers; Scott Brady's work enlivened a lot of MGM cartoons. Scheib worked for the Terry studio for more than thirty years and did a lot of good work. By now he had established his signature style and it certainly helps here.",
