    "Plot": "Oswald the Rabbit dusts and oils his trolley for another day of work. He chases off the local bunnies, who are playing on it. A big, fat piglet jumps on a bit later; Oswald's method of pig-removal is to punch the porker in the face. Oswald drives up to the water tower, which is full of passengers, not water. He dumps them into his trolley, and they're off. The rabbit's first problem of the day is getting past a haughty cow who refuses to budge from the tracks. A steep hill causes him another headache, while a butt-happy goat gives him trouble at the other end. But the real trouble comes when he loses control of the car as it careens down a hillside.",
