      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. His First Command is a mostly forgotten comedy action film that follows a young man who enlists in the army to get close to the daughter of a high ranking officer. On release there were a few sequences that featured color, but these seem to have been lost, and only a poor quality version of the film is available online. ",
