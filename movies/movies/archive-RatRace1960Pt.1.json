      "description": "Here is the hard to find 1960 film Rat Race, starring Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds. Although this is just a typical comedy-drama about live in the big city, this features nice cameos by Jack Oakie and Kay Medford, along with on location footage of New York City and others during the intro, giving a glimpse of the era.",
