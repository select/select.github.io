You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation     We have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and contributions of our star Helen Gibson. \"The Governor's Special\" is a short action drama from a serial by the name of \"The Hazards of Helen\", featuring Helen Gibson. This is episode 76 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. The first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson. They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick thinking. Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts. It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest ever. Very few of the films survive, and we are happy to be able to show this rarity to our esteemed viewers. The film is directed by James Davis from a story by Edward T. Matlack. In this episode Helen Gibson performs one absolutely breathtaking stunt, which just shows how dangerous it was to act for silent film pioneers, especially for stuntmen and stuntwomen.  There is a twist to the plot, and Helen Gibson not only has to save her governor from mortal danger, but also the life of somebody close to her, who has been sentenced to die without guilt.   Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

He speeds in his automobile to the connecting point, and at the proper moment his aides set on Stanton and succeed in making way with the bag in which the documents are carried. Tom Arnold, a tramp who has earned Helen's gratitude by aiding her in preventing an attempted robbery of the station, comes to the detective's aid, but just in time to be arrested himself as one of the thieves. Helen, convinced of his innocence, sets out on a high-powered motorcycle after the automobile containing Nash and his aides. His perilous ride is the beginning of a pursuit which reaches the climax when Helen leaps from horse-back to the speeding Governor's Special, barely grasping the hand-rail and pulling herself aboard in time to escape injury: But she succeeds in bringing the real culprit to justice and setting Arnold on his feet again.",
