      "description": "“Strange mix of comedy and drama” “Pleasantly surprised” “Suffers from mood swings” “Charming performance” (IMDB reviews quotes). It tries to be a romantic comedy; it tries be a political drama; it tries to be a screwball comedy; it tries to be a crime drama, and although it’s not quite any of these things, and in spite of the flaws in its bipolar screenplay, it is an entertaining movie with a solid cast and good A-feature production values. Go figure. IMDB rating 6.1. Directed by John H Auer. Released in 1941. Complete Print. AKA “Wheel of Fortune”",
