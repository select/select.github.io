    "Plot": "The immense dirigible balloon emerges slowly from its aerodrome and majestically rises into the heavens while a crowd of distinguished onlookers -- we'll call them 'distinguished' to make the movie sound better -- watch in admiration.This short news film -- it's only about 70 seconds long -- is by Alice Guy, who had, at this time, been Gaumont's chief director for a decade. She is not well remembered, probably because her career petered out half a dozen years later, when talent whose names are now vaguely remembered, were first becoming well known.Nonetheless, it is a beautifully shot film in half a dozen scenes, showing the whale-like airship to best advantage.",
