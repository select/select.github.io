      "description": "The Dutch city of Den Haag, internationally called The Hague, was liberated from the German occupation during World War 2 in May 1945. The Hague is know world wide for being the city of peace, among other with its Peace Palace that houses the International Court of Justice. It also is and was the residence of the Dutch government, as well as the capital of the province of South Holland. On May the 5th, the whole of the Netherlands annually celebrates the liberation of our country in 1945. But in fact The Hague was not liberated until May 8 when the Canadian troups entered this city. On the evening of May 4, 1945, the news came that German troops had surrendered in northwestern Europe. Some residents of The Hague carefully took to the streets, but they were sent home. The liberation had not yet been officially confirmed and the liberators had not yet arrived in The Hague. Anything could still happen. On 7 May, for example, dozens of people were killed in a shooting on the Dam Square in Amsterdam. Even when the liberation was confirmed on 5 May, it was not yet celebrated in The Hague. There were still armed German soldiers and agents everywhere. It wasn't until May 8, 1945, when the Allies entered the city, that the celebrations could start. The film starts with footage of food droppings near The Hague on the 29th of April, a week preceeding the liberation, to aleviate the hunger that the Dutch population suffered during the hunger winter. This time the Allied bombers have a different load than bombs. Subsequently we see the troups enter the city and being welcomed by the major on the balcony of the town hall surrounded by large numbers of very enthusiastic citizens, followed by many similar scenes in the rest of the city. In the film we also see close-ups of the arrested top of the National Socialist Movement, in short the NSB, a political party that was founded in 1931 and collaborated with the Germans during the war to run the country. Please switch on the CC captions to read the events and locations while the film plays. This is A.I. colorized footage plus the use of the latest A.I. video enhancer software.
