Based on a Broadway play of the same name, the film was produced by Howard Hughes, written by Bartlett Cormack and Charles Lederer, and distributed by United Artists. The supporting cast includes Mary Brian, George E. Stone, Matt Moore, and Edward Everett Horton. At the 4th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Picture, Milestone for Best Director, and Menjou for Best Actor.\n\nThe film, considered a screwball comedy, centers on an investigative reporter (Pat O'Brien) and his editor (Adolphe Menjou), who hope to cash in on a big story involving an escaped accused murderer (Stone) and hide him in a rolltop desk while everybody else tries to find him.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Lewis Milestone, produced by Lewis Milestone and Howard Hughes, written by Bartlett Cormack and Charles Lederer, starring Adolphe Menjou, Pat O'Brien and Mary Brian.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Front Page (1931 film)\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

Overshadowed by its eventual remake, The Front Page follows a newspaper reporter who wants to retire to live with his new fiancé, though his editor tries any method available to prevent that. His Girl Friday and the 1978 version are better remembered today, but this adaptation of the 1928 play was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a box office hit on release. ",
