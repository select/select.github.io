      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Overshadowed by its eventual remake, The Front Page follows a newspaper reporter who wants to retire to live with his new fiancé, though his editor tries any method available to prevent that. His Girl Friday and the 1978 version are better remembered today, but this adaptation of the 1928 play was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a box office hit on release. ",
