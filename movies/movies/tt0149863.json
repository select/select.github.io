    "Plot": "Puddy the Pup and a small black cat tangle in this very cute Terrytoon. This must be the fifth redesign of Puddy since he had been introduced as part of the menagerie on Al Falfa's farm about 1933. This time he is a small black-and-white dog who looks like he might be a Pomeranian. He still has a white body with one black ear, though. How do we know it's Puddy? He's got a basket to sleep in with his name on it.It's a cute cartoon, but not as saccharine as some Terrytoons. The strengths lay with the believably mischievous behavior of the cat. the gags are good and if Puddy's nature seems a bit more like a small boy than a dog, that was his standard nature. Other cartoon characters did the same thing, particular over at Schlesinger's unit for Warner Brothers. Terry's characters mixed their characteristics, part animal, part human. This one of their better efforts.",
