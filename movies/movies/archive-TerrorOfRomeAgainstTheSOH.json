It was one of 14 Peplum (or sword and sandal) films dubbed into English and released in America as part of the syndicated television series, \"The Sons of Hercules\" by Embassy pictures. It stars American body builder, Mark Forest, who played Maciste several times. For some reason, he's called Poseidon in the American version. It was written by Alfonso Brescia, Albert Valentin, and Mario Amendola and was directed by Mario Caiano.",
