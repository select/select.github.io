      "description": "This is the most commonly available version of The Phantom of the Opera. It is a re-edit of the 1925 version and originally had a synchronized sound score. It is a DVD rip from the milestone edition, with the man with lantern sequence edited in. It is the best available print of the film from the UCLA film and television archives. The soundtrack is Symphony No. 8 in B minor, best known as the \"Unfinished Symphony\". It is not the best soundtrack for the film, but I was unsure whether or not the 1929 soundtrack is in the public domain. Staring Lon Chaney, Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry. Directed by Rupert Julian, Edward Sedgwick, and Lon Chaney. The original 1925 version can be found here: http://www.archive.org/details/ThePhantomOfTheOpera1925NewYorkGeneralReleasePrint_620",
