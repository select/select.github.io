    "Plot": "When the story starts, Scrappy and Oopy are trying to make a movie. But things aren't working out so they go door to door in Hollywood looking for actors. They find baby versions of mostly comedians and, inexplicably, Garbo...and they all then dance about and little occurs in the way of comedy. The comedy, I think, was in seeing the stars parodied. It was interesting but funny, no. Most will struggle to recognize many other than Laurel &amp; Hardy and Chaplin, but the film also features Jimmy Durante, Ben Turpin, Bert Lahr, Joe E. Brown and Ed Wynn....and a couple others.Compared to the very earliest (and better) Scrappy cartoons, this one lacks the unwholesome violence and comedy that made the earliest ones the best! I am sure many parents disliked seeing Scrappy torture Oopy...but it was pretty funny. Sadly, in \"Hollywood Babies\" Oopy isn't tortured....not even once.",
