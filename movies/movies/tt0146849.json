    "Plot": "Happy Go Luckies (1923) *** (out of 4) This seven-minute animated film from Paul Terry has a few weak spots but for the most part its full of laughs and certainly plenty of imagination. The film starts off as a dog and cat decide to jump on a train for a simple ride but this turns out not to be the case and they wind up in a small town where they both enter a dog contest so that they can win some money. Terry has over one-thousand producing credits and nearly one-hundred and fifty directing credits to his name but I'm not overly familiar with his work. This short certainly made me want to try and locate some others because I was really impressed with not only the animation but all the imagination that went into it. One of the highlights in the film has the train trying to go over a step mountain but it's parts only going over one at a time. Just check out all the detail as one box car goes over at a time while the rest are slowly catching up to the front. The comedy really comes into play at the end once we get to the contest and the dog and cat must work together to make it appear that they're both one long dog. The effect is quite funny and the pay-off is rather hilarious even though you see it coming from a mile away. The animation style was extremely good and I especially liked the small details that were in nearly every frame of the picture.",
