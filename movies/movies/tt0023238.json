      "description": "If you like this movie and our channel, please subscribe: https://goo.gl/0qDmXe | \"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a 1932 Pre-Code adaptation of the 1924 short story of the same name by Richard Connell, the first film version of that story. The plot concerns a big game hunter on an island who chooses to hunt humans for sport. The film stars Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks, and King Kong leads Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong, and was made by a team including Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, the co-directors of King Kong (1933).\n\nFamous big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea) is the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He swims to a small, lush island. He becomes the guest of the expatriate Russian Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks), a fellow hunting enthusiast. Zaroff remarks that Bob's misfortune is not uncommon; in fact, four people from the previous sinking are still staying with him: Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), her brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), and two sailors.\n\nThat night, Zaroff introduces Bob to the Trowbridges and reveals his obsession with hunting. During one of his hunts, a Cape buffalo inflicted a head wound on him. He eventually became bored of the sport, to his great consternation, until he discovered \"the most dangerous game\" on his island. Bob asks if he means tigers, but Zaroff denies it. Later, Eve shares her suspicions of Zaroff's intentions with the newcomer. The count took each sailor to see his trophy room, on different days, and both have mysteriously disappeared. She believes their host is responsible, but Bob is unconvinced.\n\nThen Martin vanishes as well. In their search for him, Bob and Eve end up in Zaroff's trophy room, where they find a man's head mounted on the wall. Then, Zaroff and his men appear, carrying Martin's body. Zaroff expects Bob to view the matter like him and is gravely disappointed when Bob calls him a madman.\n\nHe decides that, as Bob refuses to be a fellow hunter, he must be the next prey. If Bob can stay alive until sunrise, Zaroff promises him and Eve their freedom. However, he has never lost the game of what he calls \"outdoor chess\". Eve decides to go with Bob. Eventually, they are trapped by a waterfall. When Bob is attacked by a hunting dog, Zaroff shoots and the young man falls into the water. Zaroff takes Eve back to his fortress to enjoy his prize. However, the dog was shot, not Bob. Bob fights first Zaroff, then his henchmen, killing the henchmen. As Bob and Eve speed away in a motor boat, the dying Zaroff tries to shoot them. Unsuccessful, he succumbs to his wounds. He falls out of a window into the pack of his frenzied hunting dogs.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack, written by James Ashmore Creelman (screenplay) and Richard Connell (story), starring Joel McCrea, Fay Wray and Leslie Banks.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Most Dangerous Game (film)\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

      "title": "The Most Dangerous Game (1932) | Colorized Public Domain Thriller with Joel McCrea and Fay Wray",
      "description": "The Most Dangerous Game (1932) is a pre-Code American thriller directed by Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack, renowned for its suspense, atmosphere, and moral questions about civilization and savagery. Produced by RKO Pictures and adapted from Richard Connell’s classic short story, this public domain masterpiece is now fully restored and colorized to captivate modern audiences. The film stars Joel McCrea, Fay Wray, and Leslie Banks in a gripping tale of survival, set against a backdrop of isolation, fear, and human cruelty. Known for being filmed on the same sets as King Kong (1933), The Most Dangerous Game has endured as one of the most iconic adventure thrillers of early Hollywood.\n\nPlot Summary:\nBob Rainsford (Joel McCrea), a celebrated big-game hunter, is shipwrecked on a remote island after his yacht is destroyed. He discovers a mysterious fortress belonging to the enigmatic Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks), a wealthy aristocrat with a dark obsession. Rainsford initially believes he has found safety, but soon learns the horrifying truth: Zaroff has grown bored with hunting animals and now stalks the most dangerous prey of all—human beings.\n\nZaroff offers his uninvited guests, including the stranded Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray) and her brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), a terrifying ultimatum: survive a night in the jungle while being hunted, or perish. As Zaroff unleashes his dogs and uses his cunning to track them, Rainsford and Eve must rely on their wits, courage, and survival skills to escape his deadly game.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Directors: Irving Pichel, Ernest B. Schoedsack\n• Producer: David O. Selznick, Merian C. Cooper\n• Screenplay: James Ashmore Creelman\n• Based on: “The Most Dangerous Game” by Richard Connell (1924)\n• Cinematography: Henry W. Gerrard\n• Editing: Archie Marshek\n• Music: Max Steiner\n\nStarring:\n• Joel McCrea as Bob Rainsford\n• Fay Wray as Eve Trowbridge\n• Leslie Banks as Count Zaroff\n• Robert Armstrong as Martin Trowbridge\n• Noble Johnson as Ivan\n\nFilm Significance:\nThe Most Dangerous Game (1932) is celebrated as one of the earliest and most faithful adaptations of Connell’s short story, which has influenced countless films, television shows, and books. Its themes of morality, survival, and the dehumanization of sport hunting remain relevant, making it a timeless cautionary tale. Filmed concurrently with King Kong on RKO’s jungle sets, the production benefited from an atmosphere of exotic danger and innovation, enhanced by Max Steiner’s dramatic score. Leslie Banks delivers a chilling performance as Count Zaroff, embodying both sophistication and madness, while Fay Wray solidified her reputation as one of the era’s most memorable leading ladies.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nAs a public domain film, The Most Dangerous Game is free from copyright restrictions and can be preserved, restored, and shared without limitation.

Schoedsack\nWriter: Richard Connell (short story by)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHgXUJMN1TXEBMtSqYpWfok-xg95KXao\nBefore conquering the screen with a giant ape, visionary filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack unleashed a different kind of terror—the human kind. Sharing much of the same crew as King Kong—including composer Max Steiner—this earlier jungle adventure trades spectacle for psychology, where the real horror lies not in beast... but in the darkness of man himself.\n\nSet on a remote island, the story follows a shipwrecked big-game hunter who becomes the prey of a twisted aristocrat. With an eerie jungle atmosphere and an unforgettable score, this early sound-era classic is a masterclass in mood, pacing, and storytelling.\n\nThe stellar cast includes Joel McCrea as the heroic Bob Rainsford, Fay Wray as the vulnerable yet resilient Eve Trowbridge, and Leslie Banks in a chilling performance as the infamous Count Zaroff. Noble Johnson and Robert Armstrong round out the supporting roles, each adding depth to this suspenseful narrative.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?

      "description": "ZAROFF, O CAÇADOR DE VIDAS ( The Most Dangerous Game, USA ) ( Filme Completo / Legendado em Português ) Data de Lançamento: 16 de Setembro de 1932 » SOBRE O FILME: O Conde Zaroff (Leslie Banks) é um nobre russo insano, que costuma ter humanos como presa quando caça em sua remota ilha. Ele se \"abastece\" provocando naufrágios, ao alterar as sinalizações que avisam onde estão os perigosos recifes de corais. O único sobrevivente de um destes naufrágios, Robert \"Bob\" Rainsford (Joel McCrea) é um famoso caçador que, quando descobre como Zaroff se \"diverte\", se revolta. O conde lhe propõe que os dois cacem os passageiros do próximo navio, mas diante da recusa o nobre decide simultaneamente caçar Bob e Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), uma outra hóspede. . Pode-se afirmar que esse clássico thriller, praticamente o criador dos filmes sobre caçadas humanas, o subgênero chamado de “manhunter”, só existe por causa de uma outra produção. Explico, no começo dos anos 30 o excêntrico produtor, diretor, cinegrafista, roteirista e aventureiro nas horas vagas Merian C. Cooper, numa viagem a África, teve uma ideia que julgava genial: a história de um gorila gigantesco que vivia numa ilha repleta de seres pré-históricos e que seria levado até a civilização onde ele escaparia de seus algozes e causaria o maior estrago. Claro que estou me referindo ao clássico King Kong de 1933, que seria dirigido por Merian e seu amigo e parceiro de várias empreitadas Ernest Beaumont Shoedsack (ambos já tinham realizados alguns filmes juntos, incluindo elogiados documentários no cinema mudo). Cooper estava realmente obcecado em levar adiante o projeto que julgava grandioso e original, na verdade não tão original assim, já que a trama lembrava “demasiadamente” o conto The Lost World de Arthur Conan Doyle, tanto que a produtora RKO teve que comprar os direitos da história para não sofrer processo por plágio. . Pois bem, para levar adiante seu intento o faz-tudo maluco tentava convencer o produtor-executivo David Selznick de que tinha que liberar a verba. Entre as negociações e o começo efetivo das filmagens de King Kong, a dupla Cooper & Schoedsack, sobre o olhar severo de Selznick, acabariam por produzir outro filme, com um orçamento menor, como que se fosse um treino para a almejada superprodução. A direção ficaria a cargo de Schoedsack e de Irving Pichel. Assim nascia o antológico The Most Dangerous Game. » » DIREÇÃO: Ernest B.
