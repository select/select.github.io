      "description": "\"The Time Machine,\" based on H.G. Wells' novel of the same name, follows the story of George , an inventor and visionary living in Victorian England. George creates a time machine that allows him to travel through time. Excited by his invention, he gathers friends to demonstrate it.After initial skepticism from his friends, George travels to the year 802,701 AD . There, he discovers a future world inhabited by two distinct species: the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean, predatory Morlocks . The Eloi live a carefree and childlike existence, but they are oblivious to the dangers posed by the Morlocks, who prey on them. George becomes fond of a young Eloi woman named Weena and tries to protect her.As George navigates this new world, he learns about the complex societal hierarchies and the consequences of humanity's evolution. The Morlocks’ subversion of the Eloi illustrates a dystopian vision of a future where technology and social class create stark divisions.George confronts the Morlocks in a bid to save Weena and return to his time. After several battles and challenges, he manages to escape with Weena.The film concludes with George returning to his own time, where he recounts his adventures, though he faces disbelief and skepticism from those around him. Ultimately, the film serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of social inequality and technological advancement.",

    "Plot": "On January 5, 1900, a disheveled looking H.G. Wells - George to his friends - arrives late to his own dinner party. He tells his guests of his travels in his time machine, the work about which his friends knew. They were also unbelieving, and skeptical of any practical use if it did indeed work. George knew that his machine was stationary in geographic position, but he did not account for changes in what happens over time to that location. He also learns that the machine is not impervious and he is not immune to those who do not understand him or the machine's purpose. George tells his friends that he did not find the Utopian society he so wished had developed. He mentions specifically a civilization several thousand years into the future which consists of the subterranean morlocks and the surface dwelling eloi, who on first glance lead a carefree life. Despite all these issues, love can still bloom over the spread of millennia.",
