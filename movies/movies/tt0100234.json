      "description": "“Good little thriller, well worth a watch” “Great atmosphere, some suspenseful moments” (IMDB reviews quotes). A low-budget crime drama with unnecessary comic relief. Alan Baxter and Virginia Gilmore head an adequate supporting cast. In fact adequate describes every aspect of this film noir wannabe that was shot entirely in Manhattan. IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Jack Donohue. Released in 1948. Two minutes are missing. ",
