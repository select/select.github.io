      "description": "When Sheriff Jake Withers (George Hayes) sees John Carruthers (John Wayne) at the safe and then finds the payroll gone, he trails him. Just as he is about to arrest him, John saves his life. Still suspicious, he joins up with the man and later they learn that Melgrove (Edward Peil Sr.), the towns leading citizen, is trying to take over the area's ranches by having his gang stop all incoming supply wagons. Almost all the Lone Star John Wayne movies have one or two quite unusual and memorable scenes. Here, it is the bizarre opening scene. It takes place in a hotel room on a rainy night and it is hard to tell what is going on for most of the scene.",
