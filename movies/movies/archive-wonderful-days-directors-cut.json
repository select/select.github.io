      "description": "Original Korean version with english subtitles. Longer, uncut director's cut. Wonderful Days (released in US and UK as Sky Blue) is a South Korean adult animated science fiction film released in 2003 and was written and directed by Kim Moon-saeng.[3] It features backdrops rendered using photo-realistic computer-generated imagery (CGI), comparable to those in the film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, along with the use of highly detailed models for some of the backdrops into which the cel animated characters were then animated. However, convincing CGI animation of humans (especially human movement) was not attempted. The backgrounds in the film were shot with traditional motion control techniques, then processed to look like computer graphics. The vehicles were all rendered, and the characters were cel animated.",
