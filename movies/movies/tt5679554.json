      "description": "Coffin 2 - The mystery man known as “Trick” is back... but not on his terms. Trick finds himself trapped in a cage with four others, all immobilized from the neck down. When Trick realizes that one of the other hostages is an old foe, Detective Epperson, the two begin working together to uncover the connection between them and their captor — a masked man they suspect to be the infamous Deathstalker Killer. Meanwhile, Agent Bobby Church of the FBI is tracking Epperson’s disappearance, which happened while the detective was following a lead in the Deathstalker case. The search soon leads Church to Epperson's former partner, Scott, himself looking into the abduction of his friend, Olivia. When Scott and Church discover cellphone pictures of Olivia in the cage with Trick and Epperson, they must race against the clock to find the location of the cage before time runs out... and the hostages are executed one-by-one.\n2017.
