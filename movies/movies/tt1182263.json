    "Plot": "Cost of Carelessness, The (1913) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Universal made this film with the co-production of The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company and it's an early safety film warning kids not to play in the streets or jumping on trolley cars. The second part of the fifteen-minute short talks to adults about bad driving and other dangerous habits. As with the legendary traffic safety films of the 1950s, this one here is pretty simple in its message but it doesn't come off quite as campy as some of the later films. I was shocked to see how graphic some of the violence was including one scene where a kid gets ran over by a trolley. You pretty much see his entire body get crushed yet you won't believe the outcome. The film starts to get tiresome towards the end but if you're a fan of this type of movie then this one here is worth checking out.",
