      "description": "“Loved it!” “Understated sexiness, interesting plot” “Sophisticated” (IMDB reviews quotes). Tom Walls is at the center of the action as a misunderstood Don Juan in this worldly British romantic comedy that probably wouldn’t have passed the US Hayes Office censors. It comes with good production values and an outstanding supporting cast. IMDB rating 6.3. Directed by Tom Walls. Released in 1936 (UK only). Complete print (minus a few missing frames)",
