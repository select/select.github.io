      "description": "In our series about The Netherlands we take a trip back in time in our time machine to the beautiful Dutch town of Alkmaar as it was in 1922. Alkmaar was and still is famous worldwide for its cheese market. For centuries farmers have brought their cheese to this market to be sold to numerous cheese traders. We see the famous Dutch \"handjeklap\" ritual that is used to bargain about the price for the cheese. Beforehand the quality of the cheese is tested by piercing a hole in the cheese to take out a sample. Cheese bearers then bring the purchased cheeses to be weighed at the \"Waag\" building in order to determine the end price for the purchased batches. Thereafter the cheese is transported by barge to all corners of The Netherlands and also abroad. The occupation of cheese bearer was/is often passed on from one generation to another. The film ends with a couple of magnificent shots of elderly bearers with very characteristic features.   Enjoy and thanks for watching!",
