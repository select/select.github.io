      "description": "“This venomous comedy is a little known gem” “Encore!” (IMDB reviews quotes). A lively, fast-talking, second-feature comedy of the New York theater that may remind some of Mel Brooks’ “The Producers” (1968). Good cast and adequate production values. Followed in 1941 by “Footlight Fever.” IMDB rating 6.0. Directed by Frank Woodruff. Released in 1940. Complete print (tape transfer).",
