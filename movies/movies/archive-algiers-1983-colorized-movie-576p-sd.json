      "description": "Algiers is a 1938 American crime drama film directed by John Cromwell , written by John Howard Lawson and starring Charles Boyer , Sigrid Gurie and Hedy Lamarr . The plot concerns a French jewel thief hiding in Algiers who meets a beautiful French tourist. The Walter Wanger production (originally distributed by United Artists ) was a remake of the successful 1937 French film Pépé le Moko , which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name. Algiers became a sensation because it was Lamarr's Hollywood debut. The film is notable as a source of inspiration to the screenwriters of the 1942 Warner Bros. film Casablanca , who wrote the later film with Lamarr in mind as the original female lead. Boyer's depiction of Pepe le Moko inspired the Warner Bros. animated character Pepé Le Pew . In 1966, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.",
