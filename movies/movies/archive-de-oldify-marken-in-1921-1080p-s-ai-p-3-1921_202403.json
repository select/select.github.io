      "description": "Marken was and still is a beautiful fishing village in The Netherlands on the borders of the former Zuiderzee. It lies on an peninsula, not far away from another very picturesq village called Volendam. It is connected to the mainland via a narrow dyke with only one road leading to and from the village. Before the closure of the Zuiderzee in 1932 with a 32km long dyke called \"De Afsluitdijk\", Marken's fishing fleet had open access to the Zuiderzee and the North Sea. After the closure the Zuiderzee became the IJsselmeer which also caused the desalnisation of its water. This had a huge impact on the fishing community who could no longer fish for sea fish but in stead had to switch to the fishing of eals and other freshwater fish. This film shows spectacular views of the village of Marken with its wooden houses, its harbor and its colorful residents. Alike many other villages that border the former Zuiderzee, Marken is famous for its local traditional costume. The Red, white and blue striped blouses, reminiscent of the Dutch flag, and the headgear of the women are typical for Marken. The men wear an overall-kind of suit with a blue cap. Both genders used to wear wooden shoes called \"klompen\" (clogs). The three original B&W film fragments, dating from 1919, 1926 and 1928, have been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of A.I. software. Voor Nederlandse kijkers: Marken is zo bekend dat het geen nadere toelichting behoeft. De filmfragmenten dateren uit de jaren 1919, 1926 en 1928. Source B&W footage: Beeld En Geluid. Music: Johannes Bornlof - The Joys And Sorrows Of Life and Howard Harper-Barnes - Drifting Emotions.",
