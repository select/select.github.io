      "description": "This is another challenge for armchair detectives in the form of a simulated mystery double feature program at second-run theater in the ‘30s. The hunt for clues begins with coming attractions and a cartoon. The first feature presentation is the classic locked-room murder mystery “The Kennel Murder Case” staring William Powell as Philo Vance. The intermission short is the mini-whodunit “The Trans-Atlantic Mystery” with Donald Meek. Then the guests are dropping like Vermont house flies in October at the sinister “Rogues' Tavern” with Wallace Ford, Barbara Pepper and Joan Woodbury.",
