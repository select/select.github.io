As a result, the gigantic Cold-War robot of mass destruction, Kolossus, wakes up from hibernation, while, elsewhere, Dr Alison Gray is struggling to come up with a way to contain the unstoppable underwater menace. Sooner or later, nature's most effective killer and man's deadliest creation will cross paths, and then, there's no telling what these two killing machines can do. Who shall live and who shall die after the final battle between Mega Shark and Kolossus?",
