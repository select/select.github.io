      "description": "A dowdy secretary named Sylvia Brenner (Constance Bennett) agrees to marry her rich, divorce lawyer boss Gaylord Stanton (Kenneth MacKenna) so that he can avoid a marriage to one of his regular clients. The deal is that Sylvia will get a great allowance and the ability to travel anywhere she wants. While on a trip to Paris she begins to find herself and develop into a confident, uninhibited woman. She attracts one of Gaylord's cad friends Reggie Durant (Basil Rathbone) and contemplates an \"affair.\" The film is a early b-studio talkie which is notable for its frank treatment of moral dilemmas and the gorgeous fashions and art-deco designs.",

      "description": "“Awfully predictable” “Ultimately unsatisfying” (IMDB reviews quotes). Hollywood’s idea of upper-class sophistication in a poorly directed, stodgy drawing room romance. The claim it’s a comedy doesn’t match the reality. Don’t blame the cast for this misfire. Recommended only as an example of what was wrong with some early talkies. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Paul L Stein. Released in 1930. Complete print.",
