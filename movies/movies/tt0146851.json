    "Plot": "This is the first cartoon on the \"Aesop's Fables\" DVD, a collection of early 1930s Van Buren animated shorts. I love the inventiveness in these old cartoons. The black-and-white actually makes me concentrate more on the sight gags....and there are plenty.For instance, a minute into the story we see a jockey preparing his horse for the day's polo matches. He opens up the neck, pours gasoline in the horse, oils and greases his hoofs, cranks up the tail and the horse is ready to go! Most of the action - and it's non-stop with an accompanying music score that will wear you out - revolves around the doings of the actual polo match. You see crazy stuff like one shot going out of the stadium and demolishing a skyscraper or one goal post scratching it's other post after the ball hits. Horses go from real to mechanical back to real. A subplot involves the jockey's girlfriend being mauled in the stands by some big cat and the latter running off with her until our hero comes to the rescue. By the time six minutes are up, you are exhausted!The artwork is basic, yes, almost like a silent movie. Well, actually it is because there are only sound effects and reactions.",
