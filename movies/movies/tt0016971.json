      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. In His First Flame, a firefighter finds out that his girlfriend only wants him for his money, except that he doesn't really have much. Will he be able to find a girl who likes him for what he does offer? On release the picture received decent but not extraordinary reviews. Modern viewers mostly see it as a short and sweet comedy.  While this version had the best visuals I could find, it still is quite rough at times. Still, it is plenty watchable in its current condition.",
