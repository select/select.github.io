      "description": "This is a heart warming comedy melodrama movie from 1935 starring Alison Skipworth , Mae Clarke , Arthur Treacher , James Ellison , Warren Hymer and Beryl Mercer . The central plot is about an impoverished English Woman who receives letters from her son in America.  After she comes into some money she decides to visit him.  The return address is Rancho San Quentin, which she has been led to believe is a California ranch which owned by the son.  The central character played by Alison Skipworth is a likeable, but somewhat naive lady.   Along the way she makes friends and has adventures.  There is a deus ex machina ending. The cast includes: Alison Skipworth as Mrs. Amelia Blake Mae Clarke as Judith Martin Arthur Treacher as Mortimer Wingate James Ellison as Jimmy Peyton Warren Hymer as Cluck Regan Beryl Mercer as Mrs. Bayne J. Farrell MacDonald as Judge Hale Christian Rub as Farmer Harold Waldridge as Oswald Brown Irving Bacon as Ed Simpson Lionel Belmore as Mr. Harker George \"Gabby\" Hayes as Miner Dell Henderson as Williams Clay Clement as Warden Ward Bond as Motorcycle Officer Otis Harlan as Mayor Loomis Charles C.
