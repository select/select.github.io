      "description": "The Student of Prague (German: Der Student von Prag , also known as A Bargain with Satan ) is a 1913 German silent horror film. It is loosely based on \"William Wilson\", a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, the poem The December Night by Alfred de Musset, and Faust . The film was remade in 1926, under the same title The Student of Prague . Other remakes were produced in 1935 and 2004. The film stars Paul Wegener in his film debut. It is generally deemed to be the first art film in history of German movies, but the french film The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (L'assassinat du duc de Guise), produced in 1908, is the first art film in history. It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios and on location around Prague. The film's sets were designed by the art director Robert A. Dietrich.",
