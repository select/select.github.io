      "description": "This is the original widescreen print, which is significantly sharper than the 4:3 print here at IA. According to IMDB this version also is in the public domain. Anyway, how could you not like a movie with dialog like this: \"We balled and we balled and we balled, until he dropped dead.\" Besides, there are many happy endings, and it gives a whole new meaning to, \"What's the buzz?\" Directed by Denis Sanders. Released in 1973. (a.k.a. \"Graveyard Tramps\")",
