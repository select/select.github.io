      "description": "Folks in a small Illinois town find a strange conical structure rising 50 feet out of the ground, after which people begin either disappearing or becoming possessed by insectoid parasites. Ed Nelson stars as the scientist investigating the thing, with a  brief appearance by an unrecognizable Leonard Nimoy. Notable primarily for the fact that Robert Heinlein's plagiarism suit over this movie stalled the production of a bigger-budget film of his novel The Puppet Masters. Ed Nelson as Dr. Paul Kettering Alan Jay Factor as Glenn Cameron Cornelius Keefe as Senator Walter K. Powers Joanna Lee as Alice Summers Jody Fair as Elaine Cameron David Hughes as Dr. Wyler Robert Ball as Dan Walker Phil Posner as Sheriff Orville Sherman as Mayor Cameron Leonard Nimoy as Professor Cole I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
