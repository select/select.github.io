Both want to secure control of a supply of helium gas found in an ancient Indian cave. Wahl, working for the federal government, is murdered at the Blue Mesa. The land strip on which the cave is located is claimed by Letty and Jim Morgan, brother and sister owners of the Lazy Y Ranch. Tin Cup Ranch owner Joe Larkin hires Ken to take possession of a cabin on the Morgan land in order to gain title.
