      "description": "This print in less than perfect. However it's complete and a noticeable improvement over the existing IA copy. A mild-mannered milkman thinks he had knocked out the middle-weight champion. One of the best Harold LLoyd comedies of the sound era. Good supporting cast. Adapted from a Broadway flop by Lynn Root and Harry Clork (sic). Remade in 1946 as \"The Kid From Brooklyn.\" Directed by Leo McCarey (& Ray McCarey uncredited). Released in 1935. Complete print. CAST NOTE Anthony Quinn's uncredited appearance as an extra was his feature film debut. TRIVIA: Director Leo McCarey and several cast members became deathly ill from drinking unpasteurized milk.",
