    "Plot": "Krazy Kat and Kitty throw a masquerade party, as you might guess from the title This is an excuse for a series of gags about the costumes the guest wear, some good, some bad, some that had whiskers in 1934, like falling into the mud and rising to proclaim \"Mammy!\"Some will make little sense to the modern audience, like a reference to Ted Lewis, but some will be quite funny.... if you notice them. Some of them go by so quick, they may escape you, like Kitty changing her clothes behind a screen, and turning the picture of Krazy around so \"he\" won't \"see\" her.... and on the picture's back is a picture of the back of Krazy's head.That's when you know a cartoon is good: when they can fford to throw away gags like that.",
