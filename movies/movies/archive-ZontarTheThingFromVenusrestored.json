      "description": "This version of Zontar is based on this version. The color in the picture was nicer but the sound was very low. Picture is slightly better. Differences The soundtrack has been remastered with higher volume levels, parametric EQ to help with any high-end cracking, bass boost to the low end, and some de-noising and de-crackling. It's not perfect but it's much better. Combined with the enhanced color it makes for a more enjoyable cheesy film experience. The picture has been slightly enhanced but not much. The only thing missing is possible frame stabilization. IMDb Summary: A misguided scientist enables an alien from Venus named Zontar to come to Earth in order to help solve man's problems. However, Zontar has other ideas, like disabling the power supply of the entire world and taking possession of important officials with mind control devices.",
