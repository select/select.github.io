      "description": "Steve Clark (Hugh Beaumont) is on a Los Angeles-bound bus and gets off in a small town en route. In his suitcase he has been carrying loot from a bank robbery; he stashes it in a safety deposit box. He becomes a taxi driver, which leads him to a chance encounter with Julie Saunders (Frances Rafferty), a local woman in her 20s. Julie lives with an elderly, bitter aunt who makes her life miserable. Clark, with his charm and original outlook on life, instantly becomes a ray of sunlight for her, and they quickly marry.\n\nHowever, Clark soon admits to her that the marriage is part of a plan he has crafted, to help him launder his ill-gotten cash—but it also involves murder and will make Julie an accessory to it, against her will.\n\nOriginal Title: Money Madness (1948) \n\nBlack & White version: https://youtu.be/XEHjXM_iINE\n\n⭐️ Main Cast:\nHugh Beaumont - Steve Clark\nFrances Rafferty - Julie\nHarlan Warde - Donald\nCecil Weston - Cora\nIda Moore - Mrs. Ferguson\nDanny Morton - Rogers\nJoel Friedkin - Mr. Wagner\nLane Chandler - Policeman\n\n🎬 CREW\nDirected by Sam Newfield (The Mad Monster, Dead Men Walk)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdbsnmiLvP8gxPJtJcbe5jcE\nWritten by Al Martin\nCinematography by Jack Greenhalgh\n\n🎯 WHY WATCH?\n🕵️‍♂️ Deadly Deception • 💔 Forbidden Romance • ⚖️ Crime & Punishment\n\n🔔 SUBSCRIBE @CultCinemaClassics\n\nFilm Noir • Mystery • Thriller • Crime • Drama • Colorized classic",
