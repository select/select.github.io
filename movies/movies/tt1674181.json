      "description": "This is the same \"The General Line\" that appears elsewhere on the archive but I have added English inter titles which make it much more accessible. Directed by Sergei Eisenstein and released in 1929, while not one of Eisenstein's best films (it was recut for political reasons and later resored).) it is a lovely portrait of Russian peasant life during the transition from human to mechanized labor.",
