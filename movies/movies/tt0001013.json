      "description": "The Redman's View was directed by D W Griffith for the Biograph Studios in 1909. (It is referred to as The Red Man's View in Wikepedia) Consider that Griffith made between 2 and 3 of these pictures a week, it is incredible to consider how much he must have worked. These stories had to be telegraphed to under 20 minutes and made clear without the use of sound. This one is interesting for its sympathetic portrayal of the Indian. This in a time when most movies were showing Indians as savage killers. The scenes of the Indians trudging across the rocky landscape are quite touching. In spite of some 19th century histrionics, it is well worth viewing.",
