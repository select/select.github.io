    "Plot": "In the summer of 2010, world leaders and activists from around the world gathered for the G20 Summit in Toronto, Canada. New laws which were passed in secret, just before the summit, resulted in a legal landscape which violated much of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With over 19,000 police officers and security personnel on hand, the results lead to over 1100 arrests, martial law in downtown Toronto, and the most massive violation of civil liberties in Canadian history. The whole world is watching.",
