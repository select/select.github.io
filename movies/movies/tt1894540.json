    "Plot": "John T. Murray and his real-life wife, Vivien Oakland, appear in this short for Vitaphone, a thoroughly amusing and nonsensical one-reel production, Technically, it is not a satire, whics is politically motivated comedy, but a burlesque. Or you can shrug and say \"whatever\". Either way, it's funny.The Murrays were married about 1917. MMiss Oakland evolved from a Ziegfeld showgirl to an accomplished movie farceur. Her best movie may well be Charley Chase's MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE, but she suported Laurel &amp; Hardy and played the screen wives of Leon Erroll and Edgar Kennedy -- although not in the same movie. Murray died in 1957. Miss Oakland the next year.",
