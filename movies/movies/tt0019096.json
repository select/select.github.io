      "description": "DVD remux of the 1928 Warner Bros. Pictures film \"Lights of New York.\" IMDb TMDB Wikipedia Lights of New York is a 1928 American crime drama film starring Helene Costello, Cullen Landis, Wheeler Oakman and Eugene Pallette, and directed by Bryan Foy. Filmed in the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system, it is the first all-talking full-length feature film. It was released by Warner Bros., who had introduced the first feature-length film with synchronized sound, Don Juan, in 1926; and the first with spoken dialogue, The Jazz Singer, in 1927. The film cost $23,000 to produce (a \"B\" picture), and grossed over $1 million. The enthusiasm with which audiences greeted the talkies was so great that by the end of 1929, Hollywood was producing sound films exclusively.",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first full-length all-talking motion picture, Lights of New York was such a monumental box office smash that it essentially killed silent film overnight. It was created for about 23,000 dollars, but made over 1,250,000 by the end of its run. Contemporary and modern critics don't have much to say about the film besides as a curio, but it still is likely worth viewing for the impact that it made on the industry.",
