    "Plot": "Daisy Jones had been married just a year when her husband failed to kiss her one morning, and she decided that he did not love her any more. She wrote a note to her friend, Ella, telling her that she was going to leave her husband a note telling him that she had jumped in the lake. She would leave some of her clothes on the pier to make it look more plausible, and she and Ella would hide themselves by and see how he took it. She got the notes in the wrong envelopes. Ella's went to her husband and vice versa. Ella was horrified and rushed to the husband's office, where she learned the truth. The husband and Ella carry out the plan and he decides to teach her a lesson. Daisy took a suit-case with some clothes in it to the pier. Ella met her. They placed the clothes on the pier. The husband came down, looked at the clothes, acted horrified for a moment, then kicked the clothes, stuck his thumb into his vest and walked away whistling a tune. Daisy saw him and cried bitterly; then became indignant. She went home with Ella. Jones decided to carry the joke farther. He went to his printer friend and had him make out a wedding invitation announcing the coming marriage of Frank Jones to Isabelle Smith, daughter of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Thomas C. Smith. By a mistake in the composing room it got into the paper, Jones was frantic. So was Mrs. Jones. Jones looked in the directory to see if anyone by the name lived in the city. Sure enough, there it was, Smith, Thomas C, Mrs. Smith and Isabelle Jones rushed to Smith's to apologize. Daisy rushed to Smith's to punish Isabelle. Isabelle happened to be Smith's cook, and she was a big Negress. She greeted Mrs. Smith with a rolling pin, and when Mrs. Jones saw her she sank into a chair. Jones, in the meantime, was on his knees begging Mr. and Mrs. Smith to forgive him. They were elderly people and a little deaf, but they understand that Jones wanted to see Isabelle. They showed him to her room. The Negress turned on Jones. Daisy aroused and protected him, then turned on Jones to give him a good round scolding, when he pulled the note meant for Ella from his pocket and his wife wept and pleaded for forgiveness. They made up and his wife learned that Frank still loved her.",
