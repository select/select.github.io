      "description": "Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden, and James Gleason star in this story about a plot to assassinate the President of the United States. Good drama, well acted... Spoiler alert: the good guys win, and the bad guys lose. The video is pretty sharp; and I cleaned up the audio. Good show. Written by Richard Sale; and directed by Lewis Allen.",
