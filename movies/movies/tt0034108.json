      "description": "If Tom Keene is remembered today it's probably for his role as Colonel Edwards in \"Plan Nine From Outer Space.\" However in the early '40s he starred in a series of matinee westerns, none of which you would likely find in a B-western hall of fame. It's easy to discover why by watching this one. Remade in 1946 as \"Tumbleweed Trail.\" Written, produced and directed by Robert Tansey Released in 1941",
