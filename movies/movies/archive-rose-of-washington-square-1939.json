      "description": "A singer (Alice Faye) becomes a star in New York's Ziegfeld Follies, but her marriage to a con man (Tyrone Power) causes her much grief. The story is so close to the true story of Fanny Brice and Nicky Arnstein that he sued the studio in a case that was quickly settled out of court in his favor. Alice Faye sings Brice's signature song, \"My Man\". Tyrone Power as Bart Clinton Alice Faye as Rose Sargent Al Jolson as Ted Cotter William Frawley as Harry Long Joyce Compton as Peggy Hobart Cavanaugh as Whitey Boone Moroni Olsen as Major Buck Russell I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum",
