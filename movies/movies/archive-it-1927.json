      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The film that made Clara Bow into one of the most popular actresses of the period, \"It\" follows a poor girl who has a crush on the owner of the store she works at. She gets a chance to get his attention, but before long a misunderstanding makes him reconsider their relationship. A huge hit critically and commercially on release, It was also considered lost for years before a print was found in Prague.",
