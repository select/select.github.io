For her, that means acts such as opera singers, extracts from \"Hamlet\" and three sailors imitating a giraffe. Bandleader Ted Lane (George Murphy)thinks hot-music, burlesque-acts and the old razzle-dazzle is just the ticket. Her programming leads to early exits and no-returns.Film debut for 12-year-old Peggy Ryan.",
