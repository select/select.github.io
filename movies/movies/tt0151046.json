    "Plot": "The Venetian canals are filled with all sorts of odd Terrytoon mice and hippos and dogs in unusual versions of gondola boats. Our hero is a Puddy/little boy-like character who happens to be a Facisti soldier, marching along with his black-shirted regiment to a great ceremony. The great aviation pioneer Italo Balbo(1896-1940) is arriving, but he's apparently such a remarkable flier he needs no plane- he just extends his arms like wings! A huge limousine with Fascist emblems pulls up, and we expect Il Duce to step out, but instead, inexplicably, it's all-American Will Rogers(1879-1935)who then puts a medal on Balbo. Then we move to the more typical precincts of Terrytoondom, a giant spidery octopus nabs a girl from her Gondola and our hero dives in the Po after them. The Octopus pad is the scene of the usual operatics and heroics and soon she is rescued, and the romance of Venice is restored.",
