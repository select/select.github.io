You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation   We have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and contributions of our star Marceline Day. \"Black Oxfords\" is an entertaining Mack Sennett short comedy.  The film is significant for Marceline Day's first leading role, in which we can see the very beginning of her illustrious career. \"Black Oxfords\" was released only days after her 16th birthday.  In just a couple years Marceline Day's meteoric rise through the movie star ranks would take her to partnerships with Buster Keaton, Lon Chaney, J. Barrymore, Norman Kerry, Lars Hanson and other male screen luminaries.  Directed by                      Del Lord Produced by                    Mack Sennett Comedies Starring                           Sid Smith, Vernon Dent, Marceline Day, Anna Hernandez, Jack Richardson Cinematography             George Spear, George Unholz Distributed by                 Pathé Exchange, Inc.
