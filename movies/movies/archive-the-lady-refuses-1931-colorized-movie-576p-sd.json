      "description": "The Lady Refuses is a 1931 American pre-Code melodrama film , directed by George Archainbaud , from a screenplay by Wallace Smith , based on an original story by Guy Bolton and Robert Milton . It stars Betty Compson as a destitute young woman on the verge of becoming a prostitute, who is hired by a wealthy man to woo his ne'er-do-well son away from the clutches of a gold-digger ( Margaret Livingston ). The plot is regarded as risqué enough to appear in at least one collection of pre-Code Hollywood films.",
