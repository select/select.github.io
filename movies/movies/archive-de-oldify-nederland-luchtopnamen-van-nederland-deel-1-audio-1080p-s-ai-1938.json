      "description": "This is Part-1 of a highly interesting film that shows The Netherlands from the air more than 80 years ago in 1938. I tried to find the locations, but the new search engine in the Beeld En Geluid archives has made this almost an impossible task. Fortunately many viewers have now assisted in identifying most of the locations in this film, as shown in the timeline and in the CC captions. Only a few locations still need to be identified. If you can help then please leave a comment! From a historic perspective this film has a lot too offer because a lot has changed since 1938, due to destruction during World War II and many new developments.
