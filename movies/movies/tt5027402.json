Frida refuses to see reason when everyone advises her to accept reality, even her mother who has a new partner. She rather dates anyone, seeking only a father. Meanwhile Tobias starts a new life, refusing to keep sharing the rent, and her school career is grimly compromised when she blindly blames unidentified pupils for the Internet-posting of her elaborate notes on her and the school girls 'cycles', with obscene graphic humor, infuriating fellow staff and parents.",
