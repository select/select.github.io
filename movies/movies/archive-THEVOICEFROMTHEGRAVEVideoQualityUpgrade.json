      "description": "This print is less than perfect. However the heavy blue cast has been removed and the contrast and brightness have been adjusted. Also now it is in the standard MPEG4 (MP4) format with a smaller download footprint. “A curiosity at best” “Good but dated” “Powell at his best” “Disappointing” (IMDB reviews quotes). William Powell is Philo Vance in what is reputed to be the first talkie whodunit. Good cast and adequate production values. However it’s more of an interesting curiosity than a solid mystery. Followed by “The Greene Murder Case.” IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Malcolm St Clair (and Frank Tuttle uncredited). Released in 1929. Complete print. AKA “The Canary Murder Case”",
