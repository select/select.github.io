His best friend, Shoichi Tsukioka, manages to find him and lands his plane next to his so he can be rescued. The two pilots are shocked when they encounter two giant monsters and race back to Japan to inform the authorities. One of the monsters is recognized as a new Godzilla while the other creature is identified as prehistoric monster named Anguirus. Without the weapon that killed the original Godzilla, countermeasures are developed in an attempt to divert the monster away as it makes landfall in Osaka.
