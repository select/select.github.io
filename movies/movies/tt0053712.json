Then they met during the Great War - they had only a few days of happiness, and then Sasha received the news of the death of her lover. But she did not believe it - she waited, raised her son, and Alexei returned. He had to go through a lot after the war. Alexei returned from captivity, so he was suspected of betrayal.
