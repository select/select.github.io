      "description": "Flight of the Graf Zeppelin from San Francisco via Lakehurst (New Jersey) back to Germany in 1928 [HD]. The director of the Zeppelin company, Hugo Eckner, can be seen in various shots as well as US president Herbert Hoover. A number of landings were filmed and the welcome that the crew received on return in Germany after 68 days. In view of the fact that Herbert Hoover became president in 1929 and the first flight of the LZ127 was on 18 september 1928, most of the film was probably shot in 1929 (not 1928 as the source indicates). Remarkable is the scene with Captain Ernst Lehmann desparately in need of a cigarette which he happily smokes once safely on the ground. Ernst Lehmann was born on May 12, 1886 at Ludwigshafen am Rhein. This originally Black & White film was first enhanced by special software whereby the motion was stabilized, the speed corrected and the picture quality improved",
