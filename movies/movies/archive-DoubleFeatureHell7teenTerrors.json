      "description": "The 2am Theater crawls out from under its rock to bring you another sure-fire insomnia cure. This cinematic version of Ambien opens with coming attractions, followed by bad actors fighting a lobster silhouette in \"Teenagers from Outer Space.\" The intermission featurette, \"Going Steady?\" induces your libido into a deep coma. Then if the rest of you is still awake, really bad actors and a guy in a gorilla suit put teenage girls into a glass booth, in \"Teenage Zombies.\" NOTE: All the items in this somnambulant simulation are available in various IA collections.",
