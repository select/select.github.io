      "description": "Batman (Lewis Wilson) and Robin (Douglas Croft) combat a Japanese spymaster (J. Carrol Naish) who is making pliable zombies out of American scientists, including the uncle of Bruce Wayne's girlfriend (Shirley Patterson). 15-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
