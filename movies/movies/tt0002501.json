    "Plot": "Jose and Carlos, brothers, are smitten with the same Senorita, and as she cares for the one as much as she does for the other, there comes the great difficulty of choosing, for brotherly love is so strongly imbued that each is loath to do anything to vanquish the other. In fact, they are what might be called the \"non-militant rivals.\" Their endeavors to induce the girl to decide between them are most unique, and each time they find themselves even. At last they draw cards, only to find, when this plan has been successful, the young lady lost to them both by being betrothed to another.",
