      "description": "Tom and Ann Quinn are a down-and-out dance team, and while Don seeks engagements, Ann works as an instructor at a dance academy, with Detective Judd one of the many customers she meets. On a hot summer night Tom, awakened from his sleep, tosses his only pair of shoes out the window to quiet two noisy cats. He goes down to retrieve them and can't find them, but Ann discovers them in front of their door the next morning. A nearby miserly recluse is found murdered in his basement room that same day, while Tom finds a wallet at the dance academy filled with old $20 bills. Footprints, bearing an imprint like those on a tap-dancer's shoes, plus Don's new-found wealth combine to make a good circumstantial evidence case for the police against Tom, and he is convicted. Before his execution, Ann seeks Judd's help in proving Tom is innocent. He turns up a suspect, Kosloff, but an airtight alibi clears him.",
