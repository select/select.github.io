      "description": "FULL MOVIE/RARE DIRECTOR'S CUT\nStars: Rita Moreno, Mark Damon, Dyan Cannon \nDirector: Richard L. Bare\n\nAfter a racially motivated gang war erupts, a pair of rookie cops infiltrate the gangs' high school to stop the senseless violence. Rita Moreno is absolutely stunning in this pre-West Side Story role. Watch for a young Dyan Cannon as Wiggles (billed Diana Cannon) in her second feature film. Based on \"All God's Children,\" a story from the LAPD's beat magazine. \n\nTRIVIA: Re-released in 1965 for the Drive-In and Grindhouse circuit titled \"Black Rebels\" or \"Lola's Mistake\" with a handful of incongruous nude scenes spiced in.",

Teenage punks slice and dice each other, turn innocent young girls into sleazy tramps, threaten innocent citizens, get involved in interracial romance, and sell drugs to local citizens. Whew! That's a lotta trashy behavior for one movie.",
