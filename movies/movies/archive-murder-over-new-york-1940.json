      "description": "Arriving at a police convention in New York, Charlie finds that an old friend from Scotland Yard has been murdered, so Chan picks up the case he was working on. Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan Marjorie Weaver as Patricia Shaw Robert Lowery as David Elliott Ricardo Cortez as George Kirby Donald MacBride as Police Inspector Vance Melville Cooper as Herbert Fenton Joan Valerie as June Preston Kane Richmond as Ralph Percy Victor Sen Yung as Jimmy Chan I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
