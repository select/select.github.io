    "Plot": "A nobleman and his beautiful daughter are so poor that they're down to their last tea bag. When it rains it pours: bursting into their castle is the tax man, singing operetta. Their taxes are long past due, he intones. And if they don't pay, out they go. The nobleman protests, via song, that he hasn't got a cent, and his knights, acting as a chorus, back him up by repeating \"He hasn't got a single cent\" over and over. Twirling his mustache, the tax man tells them he'll pay their bill if the daughter consents to marry him. Never, she repeats ad nauseam. Besides, their knights will win them a lot of money in the next day's jousting tournament. The tax man laughs uproariously. He is competing as well, and he intends to win. True to his chortle, the tax man, now dubbed the Black Knight, proves to be an overwhelming competitor. But there's still one knight who can save the day, and he doesn't even need armor. It's Mighty Mouse to the rescue.",
