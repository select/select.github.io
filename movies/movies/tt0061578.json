      "description": "In 1944, a deposed American major is forced to form a \"suicide squad\" of 12 criminal psychopaths in a military penal camp. Together they are tasked with raiding an SS barracks and, through this \"probation,\" are released from the most severe court sentences. Only two of them survive, their limbs shot to pieces.   A perfectly staged, equally dark and brutal war thriller with impressive acting performances, the film only manages to shock viewers through its conspicuous absence of any moral and psychological depth or evaluation.",
