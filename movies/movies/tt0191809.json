    "Plot": "The Ingenues are an 18-piece, all-women band. Dressed in matching frilly white dresses with flowers sewn on, they perform. They start with an up tempo piece featuring three brief solos. Then Frances, an accordion player, fronts the orchestra and leads them through a piece that features eight more accordions. A harp solo is followed by a cello duet. Then, more than a dozen banjos take over: after a few licks, they break into a spirited vocal of \"Shakin' the Blues Away.\" Out come the woodwinds to join the brass and banjo in a version of \"Tiger Rag.\" The orchestration includes bass, bassoon and kazoo. The women stand at the end.",
