      "description": "This film contains wonderful footage of the Dutch province of Limburg over a century ago between approximately 1919 and 1921. Limburg is the most hilly southern part of The Netherlands with the Vaalserberg being the highest in the country at 322 meters above sea level. Many tourist flock to Limburg for its great landscapes consiting of meandering small rivers, hillsides, meadows, cloisters, churches and abbeys, and other great vistas. The Margraten American WW-II cemetary is another well-visited location. The film ends with footage of the 'mergel' (limestone) quaries at the 171 meters high Sint Pietersberg that until very recent still was being used to produced cement. In this film many parts of this scenery were still in tact whereas nowadays only about [30%*] remains. After years of protest the ENCI company stopped in 2018 with exploiting these natural resources. For more information, see the time line below. The original B&W footage has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, restored, enhanced and colorized with modern A.I. video software.
