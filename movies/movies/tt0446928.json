    "Plot": "Some time back, I'd read about an invention they tried out (unsuccessfully) in the 1940s. Music video-like productions were filmed and could be seen on machines in bars and restaurants--much like traditional juke boxes. Very few people know about these today and up until this film, I'd never seen any of these short films.BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES is one of these films and was included in the recent \"Harry Langdon: Lost and Found\" DVD set. Believe it or not, it features an old Harry Langdon singing and performing in a cute skit with a group of models. While the other review is right that some of the models ain't too bright, Langdon came off very well--particularly because the films that exist from the later portion of his career were pretty poor. This is a slight improvement and well worth seeing if you are a fan of this all but forgotten comedian.",
