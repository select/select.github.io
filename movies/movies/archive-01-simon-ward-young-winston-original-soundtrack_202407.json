      "description": "🎭 📽️ Simon Ward 📽️🎭 Personal Note: Simon Ward was a British actor that came from very humble beginnings. His mom was the one in the family that dreamed of being an actress but never got that big break. She passed that dream on to her son, who, armed with stunning good looks & charm, forged his way into an acting career. In my humble opinion, I found him to be a very convincing actor with great range. His real handicap was that he refused to move his family to the USA. To emphases this point, this was a time when personal income taxes were very high in Great Britain. That was the reason John Lennon left England. You have to love him for that! Simon Anthony Fox Ward  (16 October 1941 – 20 July 2012) was a British stage and film  actor . He was known chiefly for his performance as  Winston Churchill  in the 1972 film  Young Winston . He played many other screen roles, including those of Sir Monty Everard in  Judge John Deed  and  Bishop Gardiner  in  The Tudors . Early life and education Simon Ward was born on 16 October 1941 in  Beckenham ,  Kent , the son of Leonard Fox Ward, a  car dealer , and his wife Winifred. From an early age he wanted to be an actor. He received his formal education at  Alleyn's School ,  London , where from the age of 14 he was one of the founding members of its drama group that became the  National Youth Theatre , and stayed for eight years. He trained at the  Royal Academy of Dramatic Art  from 1961. Career Ward made his professional stage debut with the  Northampton Repertory  in 1963, and his London theatrical debut one year later in  The 4th of June . He worked in  repertory  in  Northampton ,  Birmingham  and  Oxford  and occasionally in  London's West End . His big break in theatre came in 1966 when he played Dennis in  Joe Orton 's  Loot , which led to a number of small film and television roles. All of Ward's major film roles were in the 1970s. His first film appearance was probably an unaccredited role as one of the  sociopathic  students in  Lindsay Anderson 's  If....  (1968). He was primarily a stage actor when selected to play the title role in  Young Winston  in 1971, the role which brought him to national prominence. The in-demand Ward starred in several high-profile films during the remainder of the 1970s. In 1973 he played the  Duke of Buckingham  in  Richard Lester 's  The Three Musketeers  and in 1974 appeared in its sequel  The Four Musketeers . Also in 1974 he played author-veterinarian  James Herriot  in the successful film adaptation of  All Creatures Great and Small . He played one of the lead roles (Lt. Crawford) in the 1976  World War I  film  Aces High , then starred as Lt. William Vereker in the 1979 film  Zulu Dawn . He was also seen as Captain Hoffmann, a fictional  Nazi  functionary, in  Hitler: The Last Ten Days  (1973). Later film roles included  Zor-El  in  Supergirl  (1984). In 1986, Ward starred in the title role of  Ross , the first  West End  revival of  Terence Rattigan 's play since its original run in 1960. It toured the UK and, after a run at the  Royal Alexandra Theatre ,  Toronto , opened at  The Old Vic , featuring  Marc Sinden  as Dickinson, with  David Langton ,  Roland Curram ,  Bruce Montague  and  Ernest Clark  in supporting roles. Ward made few films after the 1970s, although he did have a major role in the  Ralph Fiennes  version of  Wuthering Heights  (1992), alongside his daughter  Sophie Ward . In 1987 he sustained a serious head injury in a street attack, the circumstances of which were obscure. He believed the attack, which left him with a broken skull that needed brain surgery, caused the chronic blood disorder,  polycythaemia  that affected his career. In 1995, at very short notice, he took over  Stephen Fry 's role in the play  Cell Mates , after Fry walked out of the play near the start of its run. In 2001–07, he appeared as Sir Monty Everard in the  BBC  television series  Judge John Deed  and in 2007–10 as Bishop  Stephen Gardiner  in  The Tudors . In 2010, Ward appeared in the title role in the British tour of  Alan Bennett 's play  The Madness of George III . Death Having been afflicted with ill health in his later years, Ward died at the age of 70 on 20 July 2012 in  Taunton ,  Somerset . His body was buried on the East Side of  Highgate Cemetery  in London. A memorial service was held in his memory at  St Paul's Church ,  Covent Garden , London, on 9 July 2013. Personal life In 1964, Ward married Alexandra Malcolm, whom he met while they were students at  RADA . They had three daughters:  Sophie , Claudia and Kitty.  Internet Archive is a NON-PROFIT 501 © (3) Web site. They get NO money from the Government. They depend totally on your donations.
