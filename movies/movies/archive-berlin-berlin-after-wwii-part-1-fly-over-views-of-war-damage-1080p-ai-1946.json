      "description": "This is an experiment of how much can be achieved with contemporary A.I. software to restore poor quality old film footage. This restored footage has been motion-stabilized, speed-reduced, sharpened, contrast & brightness enhanced, noise-reduced, colour-intensified and enhanced with Topaz A.I. software. The results are fair to good, but far from perfect. Berlin was heavily bombed by the British RAF and US airforce, especially towards the end of WW-II. The Battle of Berlin started on 16th of April 1945 and lasted until the 2nd of May. The city was attacked from two sides, from the East by the Soviet Union and from the West by the allied forces. This film shows war-torn damage during the summer of 1945. The exact date(s) of filming is unknown. What can be observed is that the streets have been largely cleared from rubble and an occasional pedestrian and car can be seen. Overall the city looks empty. Most inhabitants have fled to other less damaged and rural areas.
