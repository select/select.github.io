      "description": "GREAT FREEDOM By Sebastian Meise L CLIP L MFF Gems 2021 Austrian helmer Sebastian Meise’s sophomore feature, Great Freedom, tells the life story of a man (played brilliantly by German actor Franz Rogowski) who spends most of his adult life in prison for being homosexual. Meise’s impressive drama, which premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section earlier this year —where it was awarded the Jury prize—, examines post-war Germany in three different periods, with a particular interest in the criminalisation of queer life under the infamous Paragraph 175. Among other recognitions, such as the main award in Sarajevo. Great Freedom has also been selected as the Austrian entry for the Oscars in 2022.",
