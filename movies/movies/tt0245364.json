    "Plot": "I don't know why I dislike the Katzenjammer kids so much, but I just don't find them appealing. They play mild pranks, but the only result is the almost-a-thrill of seeing the big fat dad scratch his head in puzzlement and then open his mouth and eyes really wide. That's not much of a pay off. While I'll sound like I have the shortest attention span in the world, even at a mere 7 minutes, I thought this cartoon was much too long. Very little actually happens, and it seems that several times footage was repeated. The only sequence that I found amusing was when the mom is baffled that her ball of dough has come to life (it's actually the much-abused kitty covered in dough!).",
