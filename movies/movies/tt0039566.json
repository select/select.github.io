      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: The film LIFE WITH FATHER (1947) was adapted from the 1939 Broadway play, which was based on Clarence Day's autobiographical stories about his family and father, a governor on the New York Stock Exchange. The Broadway production ran for 3,224 performances and still holds the record as the longest-running non-musical play in Broadway history. \n\nStars: William Powell, Irene Dunne, Elizabeth Taylor\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nIn late 19th-century NYC, a stockbroker strives to maintain authority over his bustling household, but it's his wife who truly rules the roost.\n\nTRIVIA: Since both leads demanded top billing,  half of the released prints billed Dunne first and the other half listed Powell first. First-run theaters were required to these alternate prints and advertising alternated the same way.",
