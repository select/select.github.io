      "description": "Kind of a Elizabeth Bathory movie set in an empty hotel. The desk clerk remembers our vampiress from when he was a little boy and is properly frightened of her.  Less neck biting and more mind control than some movies of this sort, our vampire is more of the soul sucking type. Similar story line that Hunger will follow in 1983.",
