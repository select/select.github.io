    "Plot": "A thoroughly enjoyable film, The Affairs of Styx is a witty whodunit with (fortunately not too frequent) elements of comedy. The Czech-Hungarian director Karl Anton does a very good job: the direction is pretty impressive, complete with very fluent and modern camera work and absolutely brilliant lighting. The moody Gothic atmosphere, heavy with shadows and unspoken words, is very reminiscent of Hitchcock's work in the thirties. The actors are likable and there are some great interiors to behold. Like most of the German films of that period, this film also promotes one song, which is sang, listened, played and danced to with such violent frequency that it sticks to one's brain, so the viewer is designed to walk in the closest record store and demand a copy upon leaving the cinema. But even the overexposure of that tune doesn't diminish the pleasure one gets from this very entertaining film, perfect for a late (and stormy) night viewing.",
