      "description": "Dziga Vertov's Man With A Movie Camera is considered one of the most innovative and influential films of the silent era. Startlingly modern, this film utilizes a groundbreaking style of rapid editing and incorporates innumerable other cinematic effects to create a work of amazing power and energy. Film pioneer Dziga Vertov uses all the cinematic techniques available at the time - dissolves, split screen, slow motion and freeze frames. This movie is silent! But here are some music that i think fit to it The Drum & Bass from Digibeat Music and the groovy sound from Centerpole If you know of music that you think do fit to this Movie please say so in your review and share with all of us",
