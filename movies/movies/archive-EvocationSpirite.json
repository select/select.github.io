      "description": "Release Date: 1899 Country: France Written and Directed by Georges Méliès AKA \"Summoning the Spirits\" AKA \"Invoking the Spirits\" Évocation Spirite is a simple trick film from Georges Méliès. In it he plays a magician who presents us with a wreath. From within this a woman's head appears. This in turn transforms into the head of the devil and then into Méliès himself. It's a basic set up and is only really a showcase for one visual bit of trickery. It's nicely done though and does illustrate again the imagination of Méliès. I wouldn't say it's one of his more inspired efforts though. It does seem merely a little diversion, rather than a fully-fledged piece. Still, like all films from this innovator, it's yet another example of the crazy visual ideas of this genius of the first age of cinema. For that reason, it's worth seeing. - 15 April 2012 | by Mondo_Giallo (Edinburgh, Scotland, UK)",
