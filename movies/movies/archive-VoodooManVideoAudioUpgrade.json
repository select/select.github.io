      "description": "This print is sharper, with better contrast and cleaner audio than the existing IA copy. Lugosi, Zucco, Carradine and a bevy of all-girl zombies in one of the wackiest B horrors you're ever likely to see. The proceedings are nicely helped along by Wanda McKay's steadfast refusal to act. It wasn't produced as a comedy, but you can be forgiven for thinking it was. (Don't let it bother you that the first victim's car changes make and color from one scene to the next.) Directed by William Beaudine. Released in 1944. Complete print. TRIVIA: Shot in seven days. The last of Lugosi's nine Monogram films, although the previously-shot \"Return of the Ape Man\" was released later.",
