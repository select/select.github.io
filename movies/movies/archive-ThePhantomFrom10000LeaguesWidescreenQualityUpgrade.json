      "description": "This is the original widescreen theatrical print which is significantly sharper than the 4;3 print found elsewhere at IA. An ultra-low-budget sci fi romp in which a radiation-spawned monster terrorizes a California beach, without actually showing up on the beach. He (it) does manage to sink the same rowboat three times. Will Venice Beach survive? And what about the rest of us? Directed by Dan Milner Released in 1955 complete print",
