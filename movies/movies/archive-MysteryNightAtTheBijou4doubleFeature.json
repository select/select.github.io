      "description": "A simulated double feature program at a second-run movie house in the 1940s. This night of murders most foul begins with coming attractions and a cartoon. Then a stripper turns detective in \"Lady of Burlesque,\" starring Barbara Stanwyck, followed by the Robert Benchley short, \"How to be a Detective.\" Then the baffling murder of a Chinese princess is a case for \"Mr. Wong in Chinatown,\" starring Boris Karloff.",
