      "description": "Baby photographer Ronnie Jackson, on death row in San Quentin, tells reporters how he got there: taking care of his private-eye neighbor's office, Ronnie is asked by the irresistible Baroness Montay to find the missing Baron. This leads to confusing but sinister doings in a gloomy mansion and a private sanatorium, with every plot twist a parody of thriller cliches. What are the villains really after? Can Ronnie beat the murder rap? Bob Hope as Ronnie Jackson Dorothy Lamour as Carlotta Montay Peter Lorre as Kismet Lon Chaney Jr. as Willie John Hoyt as Dr. Lundau Charles Dingle as Maj. Simon Montague Reginald Denny as James Collins Frank Puglia as Baron Montay Ann Doran as Miss Rogers Alan Ladd as Sam McCloud I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
