    "Plot": "What is it about bulldogs that aroused the ire of cartoonists? I have never met a bulldog who was less than amiable, but they have long served as the bully in cartoons, including \"Butch\" in the Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons and a couple in Termite Terrace cartoons -- usually wearing sweater and a derby in the latter.In any case, this Terrytoon about a cat who finds Aladdin's lamp and uses its Hugh-Herbert-voiced genie to bring the bulldog to heel is a pretty good one. It has three well-directed comedy sequences, including one that looks like it was lifted from one of Friz Freleng's farce chase sequences. None are particularly original, but given Terry's target audience of young, uncritical children, it is more than good enough.",
