      "description": "Thinking it will be easy to make his fortune Down Under, Englishman Richard Connor (Peter Lawford) travels to Australia only to find he's been grossly misinformed. Broke and demoralized, he teams up with petty criminal John Gamble (Richard Boone) just to scrape together enough money to go back home.  Their plan is to con a local rancher (Finlay Currie) into thinking Connor is his estranged son, but things go awry when Connor falls in love with the rancher's daughter (Maureen O'Hara).",
