      "description": "The title is a take-off parody of Billy Rose's Aquacade, and uses an ordinary bathtub, as aqua-mice perform aquatic ballet dances and water sports. The soap bubbles float downstairs to where the dog and cat are sleeping, who blame each other for the disturbance, and have a fight about it. When they learn the mice are the bubble producers, they go after them with a vacuum cleaner. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/billy-mouses-akwakade-1940/",
