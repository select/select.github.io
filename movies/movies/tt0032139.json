Mike takes Smoky with him. In Canada, Mike meets a priest, Father Devlin and Grogan, an Irish mine worker, and when Mike gets into a fight with \"Bull\" , the impressed Groagn and Father Devlin befriend him. Mike meets with Carson, the mine superintendent, who tells Mike that the mine is losing money and should be sold to Radium Syndicate Ltd., Inc., because the cost of shipping radium is too high for a single owner. But Mike also meets the Indian maiden, Towanah, who begs him not to sell the mine, and she introduces him to her father, Dr. McTavish , who is perfecting a new process of reducing radium which will make the cost of shipping it negligible. Carson declares that the McTavish process is no good, and then informs Mike Sr. that his son only staying in Canada because of his affair with Towanah. The down-hearted Mike Sr. decides to sell the mine. Mike has to find a way to keep his father from making a mistake.",
