    "Plot": "Thanksgiving wasn't fully settled in as a national holiday when Paul Terry released this one about the Pilgrims hitting Plymouth Rock and one of them winding up slaughtering a tribe of Indians. It looks, in fact, like it should have been released in late October for the Thanskgiving shows.It is a good Terrytoon, as the technical issues of movement, character design and music have all settled into the model that would apply for the next decade. All that would be required would be the advent of technicolor and a couple of star performers, The last would be a few years in coming.What is particularly good about this one is that Terry's staff doesn't just aim its gags at small children. They seem to have caught the conflation that small children make, as in the shot where the Indian is riding a buffalo to the wigwams.",
