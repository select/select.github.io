      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This early survival adventure film was Carole Lombard's first talkie film. It was also released with a silent version, although the sound version was preferred by critics at the time. Modern audiences have no reason to remember the film other than Ms. Lombard's role and a look at an early picture in the survival genre. ",
