Arthur Cinematography Fred Guiol Release date June 29, 1919 Country United States Language Silent with English intertitles Spring Fever is a 1919 short comedy film directed by Hal Roach and starring Harold Lloyd . Plot Harold is an office worker whose mind wanders from his mundane clerical tasks due to the lovely weather. Unable to resist the pull of a park on a beautiful spring day, Harold abandons his job. He is pursued into the park by annoyed office colleagues and his boss. Harold's playful antics in the park quickly annoy several people, causing a large mob to start chasing him. While hiding in some shrubbery, Harold encounters Bebe who herself is hiding from an unwanted suitor (Snub). The mob attacks Snub, mistakenly believing him to be Harold. Bebe and Harold quietly escape to an ice cream parlor where Harold has insufficient money to pay for their treats. Harold attempts a few creative tricks to avoid paying the bill. In the end, Harold deceives the waitress into thinking that a still groggy Snub has agreed to pay his tab. The film ends in Bebe's garden, where Harold and Bebe embrace as a new couple.
