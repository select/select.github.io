      "description": "Magdala Rose - In 1244, during a time of religious persecution, Pope Innocent IV and King Louis IX of France sought to eradicate a pacifist Christian group known as Cathars. The last of the Cathar heretics found protection at the Castle of Montsegur. Here a dedicated group of about 100 defending knights, under the Leadership of Lord Raymond and his family, held a crusading army of over 10, 000 mercenaries at bay for 9 months. To this day, many people believe that the Cathars were the guardians of a treasure of great significance, possibly even the Holy Grail. It is rumoured that in the last days of the siege a small group managed to slip away in the dead of night to retrieve this hidden treasure and get it safely away from the clutches of the Catholic Church. This is their story.\n2019.  Stars: Katie Anderson, Wesley Ford, Lachlan Barker\n*Licensed from Bridgestone Multimedia Group.
