      "description": "Shiro Miura , an architect, suddenly returns to Marukin Onsen, the public bath house left behind by his late father. The reason for his return is to tell his younger brother Goro, who manages the store, that he will fold the old public bath and rebuild it into an apartment. Goro reacts coldly to Shiro, who runs away from his parents' house and lives freely in the city. On the other hand, Yokoyama a postal worker who is nearing retirement age, is fascinated by Yudo, which is said to give him deep thoughts about bathing. (Source: Filmarks) ",
