      "description": "Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula bends naive real estate agent Renfield to his will so that he can move to London. He takes up residence at an estate where he sleeps in his coffin by day and searches for potential victims by night. After turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his attention to her friend Mina. But Mina's father calls in a specialist, Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration in Mina's health. Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula Helen Chandler as Mina Seward David Manners as John Harker Dwight Frye as Renfield Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing Herbert Bunston as Doctor Seward Frances Dade as Lucy Weston I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural.",
