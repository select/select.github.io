      "description": "The Blancheville Monster , released in the UK and Italy as Horror , is a 1963 horror film directed by Alberto de Martino . The film's script by Gianni Grimaldi and Bruno Corbucci is promoted as being based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe , but actually only borrows elements from the short stories \" The Fall of the House of Usher \", \" A Tale of the Ragged Mountains \" and \" Some Words with a Mummy \". Long after its release, director Alberto de Martino described his film as \"a little film of no importance\".",
