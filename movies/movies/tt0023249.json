      "description": "\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is a horror film directed by Robert Florey , loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. The film stars Bela Lugosi as the sinister Dr. Mirakle, who conducts twisted experiments in 19th-century Paris.  Dr. Mirakle, a deranged scientist, is obsessed with proving that humans and apes are biologically related. To do this, he abducts young women, injecting them with blood from his pet gorilla, Erik , in hopes of creating a hybrid. His experiments fail, leading to the deaths of many of his victims. The story unfolds through the eyes of Pierre Dupin , a medical student who becomes embroiled in the sinister happenings. He is in love with Camille L'Espanaye , who becomes one of Mirakle's targets. The plot thickens as Pierre and Camille, along with their friends, visit Mirakle’s carnival sideshow, where his horrific practices begin to reveal themselves. After Camille is kidnapped by Mirakle, Pierre desperately seeks help from the police, trying to convince them of the scientist's malevolent actions. As the story progresses, a series of gruesome murders points to Mirakle's involvement. In the climax, a confrontation occurs between Pierre and Mirakle. Erik, the gorilla, ultimately turns against his master, leading to a chaotic showdown. Pierre manages to rescue Camille but is forced to face the tragic consequences of Mirakle's experiments.",
