      "description": "Hatching a scheme to sell rifles to the Indians as a protection against the white settlers, Jim Haverly (Monte Blue) works both sides against the middle by having his henchmen masquerade as Indians and raid the settlers. With the ranchers preparing for retribution against the Indians, Haverly's plan is working well until Steve Reynolds/The Durango Kid (Charles Starrett) shows up and, with the aid of a young white boy (Tommy Ivo) and his young Indian friend (Don Reynolds), and his bumbling sidekick Smiley (Smiley Burnette), begins the process of uncovering the actual villains. Charles Starrett as Steve Reynolds / The Durango Kid Don Reynolds as Little Hawk Tommy Ivo as Billy Haverly Monte Blue as Jim Haverly Smiley Burnette as Smiley Burnette I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
