They soon discover they are polar opposites and dislike each other very much. Oklahoma oilman Sam Sawyer and his new bride Emmy, on their way to honeymoon in Niagara Falls, come along and offer help and Sam gets the idea that Margie and Tom are married and having a lover's spat. Later when all are checking into the hotel, the befuddled manager, thanks to Sam who is still trying to get them to kiss and make up, gives them a room together which Marge and Tom don't realize, since Sam has given up his and Emmy's Honeymoon Suite in order to get them over their spat. Sam takes over and locks them in the suite together for the night and stands guard outside the room until they solve their marital problems. Sam has some of his own with the frustrated Emmy as they have put off their wedding for twenty years in order to afford to honeymoon in Niagara Falls.",
