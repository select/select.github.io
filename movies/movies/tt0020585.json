      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Lost for multiple decades, a 35mm print of Why Be Good? was discovered in an Italian archive in the late 1990's. It follows a man whose father states that the women of that time have no virtues. The woman he is interested in has her father repeat something similar about young men of the time. Eventually the young man decides to \"test\" the virtue of the woman he is in love with. ",
