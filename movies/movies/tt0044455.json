    "Plot": "Made during the period when Clayton Moore had been replaced on the Lone Ranger television series by John Hart, but actually appears to have been made during the dawn of the sound era because of the excessive amounts of stock footage culled from earlier westerns made by producer Edward Finney, who never let much film from his productions be used only once, which accounts for some Monogram stock with Tex Ritter and Tris Coffin. Story concerns the efforts of Buffalo Bill to protect the Indian's land from a gang who want to get the gold buried there. The outlaws disguise themselves as Indians and raid and plunder the settlers in order to blame the tribe.",
