      "description": "he Twin Peaks Tunnel is a 2.27 Mile (3.65 km) long light rail and streetcar tunnel in San Francisco, California. The tunnel runs under Twin Peaks, a hilly area on the edge of San Francisco as an extension of the famous Market Street. The tunnel was opened on 3 February 1918 and thus celebrated its 100th aniversary in 2018. This interesting film shows the primitive construction method, whereby steam shovels were used and horse-and-carts to remove the rubble. Subsequently the film shows the opening of the tunnel with a huge crowd that queus-up to get a first ride. Modern Artificial Intelligence video software was used to motion-stabilize, speed-correct, restore, enhance and colorize the old B&W film footage.
