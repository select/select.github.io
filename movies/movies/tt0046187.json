Ele passa, então, a ser perseguido pela vítima do roubo e por agentes. . Década de 1950. Estamos em plena efervescência do período histórico que ficou conhecido como Guerra Fria, onde o mundo ficou polarizado pelas tensões do conflito entre capitalismo versus comunismo, capitaneados pelas potências EUA e a então URSS. . Nos Estados Unidos, campanhas patrióticas e anticomunistas (como o macartismo, a famosa caça as bruxas) colocavam vários artistas em uma famigerada lista negra. O então relativamente novo Samuel Fuller, com 41 anos e em seu sexto filme como diretor, ousou fazer uma obra-prima noir sobre o tema, com teor crítico, sem maniqueísmos e sem apelar para patriotadas. O fascinante Anjo do Mal (Pickup on South Street), de 1953. » » DIREÇÃO: Samuel Fuller GÊNERO: Crime, Filme Noir, Thriller ORIGEM: USA DURAÇÃO: 1h 20min » » ELENCO PRINCIPAL: Richard Widmark ...
