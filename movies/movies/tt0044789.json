At the time of upload, it looks and sounds much nicer than anything else available on the Archive. For the record, it's one of those situations where the bitrate is lower than a couple of other uploads on the Archive, but that's just do to the sloppy encodes on those other uploads; they don't look or sound anywhere near as good, I think you'll agree. As always, thank you to the original ripper and seeders!",

      "description": "\"Kansas City Confidential\" is a 1952 film noir crime film directed by Phil Karlson and starring John Payne. The film was marketed with the tagline \"Exploding like a gun in your face!\" and released in the United Kingdom as \"The Secret Four\".\n\nFour robbers hold up an armored truck, getting away with over a million dollars in cash. Joe Rolfe (John Payne), a down-on-his-luck flower delivery truck driver is accused of being involved and is roughly interrogated by local police. Released due to lack of evidence, Joe, following the clues to a Mexican resort, decides to look for the men who set him up both to clear his name and to exact revenge. What he doesn't know is that the heist involves a retired policeman who is also intent on revenge. The plot was inspiration for Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Phil Karlson, produced by Edward Small, screenplay by George Bruce, and Harry Essex, story by Rowland Brown and Harold Greene, starring John Payne\nColeen Gray, Preston Foster, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"Kansas City Confidential\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
