      "description": "Krazy's in an all-out war with the residents of a retired soldiers' home. In the beginning, he's doing very well as a creative caregiver, but when the residents are clamoring for their soup and Krazy trips and spills it, the incident escalates into a wild battle, with everything and anything used as weapons.

When, however, they insist on being fed, Krazy can't satisfy their appetites and has to pelt them with cakes and bologna slices, while they try to kill him with musket fire.I have always assumed that these cartoons didn't just happen after some animators did six thousand random pictures and a genius had to put them in some order to ship out Yet reading that story description -- which is accurate -- I am filled with doubt. Am I sure? Not any more, I'm not.Some of the gags are funny, but none enough to make me watch it again just now.",
