    "Plot": "Everyone hides when the stork comes lying over to deliver a new-born infant. He finally drops the bundle in the home of a rabbit. It contains a skunk. For some reason, this is particularly unwelcome in this mediocre Terrytoon.This is one of the Terrytoon stories that appeared in earlier versions and by now it was getting very tired. The infant skunk is given a cute appearance and an innocent child's voice, as if we are not supposed to know or care why people don't want to be around skunks. Of course, it will all end for the best, we can be confident, when the skunk turns out to be useful for some reason. That's the way these things always end. The moral is \"Be useful and they'll put up with anything. Don't be useful, and you'd best be on your way now. It's a fine, thoughtless lesson for Paul Terry's studio to offer its audience of small children.Well, they weren't the only ones to ignore the clear message. It's every Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon ever made.",
