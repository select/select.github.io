Given the fact that she has not fully recovered from her illness, how will she, her Norwegian guide and coach, Monica Berglund, her English husband, Paul Bowen, and her family define and achieve success at Whistler Olympic Park? How does having a baby complicate and enrich the life of a successful blind athlete and her family?",
