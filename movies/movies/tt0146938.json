    "Plot": "Cubbie Bear is reading a book and falls asleep. It is the story of John Smith and Pocahontas and becomes a serious of rather racist portrayals of Native Americans. I will give them credit for pulling back a little bit, but the portrayal of the Indians uses ever stereotype, culled from Westerns at the time. The animation is OK. But no great shakes for plot.",
