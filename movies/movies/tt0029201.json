      "description": "“Wonderful, eye-opening” “Overlooked classic” “Fantastic movie” “Timeless parable of power and the human condition” “I loved this movie” (IMDB reviews quotes). H G Wells’ delightful seriocomic fantasy of what might happen if the gods granted omnipotence to an ordinary bloke played Roland Young. He is backed by a strong supporting cast. The production values are first rate including what at the time were cutting edge special effects. Rarely has a thought provoking movie been this much fun. IMDB rating 7.1. Directed by Lothar Mendes (and Alexander Korda uncredited). Released in 1936 (UK). Complete print. AKA “H G Wells’ The Man Who Could Work Miracles”",
