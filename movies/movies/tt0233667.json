    "Plot": "This Forum Film Company comedy from Germany, directed by comedian Joe Stoeckle, focuses on a group of German soldiers billeted behind the lines in a captured French town during WW I, and was made only a couple of years before there would be a slew of German troops once again billeted in French towns. The best parts come when the attractive Leny Marenbach and Charlotte Daubert are serving as screen decorations. The comedy derives from such incidents as...when a soldier (the top-billed Guenther Lueders) goes rabbit hunting. But the Major shoots at the rabbit the same time as he does, and claims it. Adding insult to injury, the officer orders Lueders to cook it. Lueders finds a cat the same size as the rabbit and the Major and his staff get hasten-braten a la cat. The Major orders Lueders to sample the stew also.",
