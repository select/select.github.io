    "Plot": "Yet another unfunny Leslie Fuller farce.One of the writers is John Paddy Carstairs who would become a director in years to come.His idea of comedy is a stuttering legionnaires. Two notable members of the cast are Betty Field,sister of Gracie and Renee Houston who was a double act with her sister on the halls.The plot,such as it is,concerns Fuller and Gordon's adventures in the foreign legion.There are British comedies of this era that are far more deserving of a dvd release than this load of rubbish.",
