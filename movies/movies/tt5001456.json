After rampaging through the research centre the fearsome creature escapes into nearby Devil's Creek where families and holidaymakers are enjoying summer vacation. As the government hires a squad of deadly mercenaries to lead a search and destroy mission, the residents of Devil's Creek realize that terror is not extinct as they face the deadly wrath of the Primeval Predator. It's man against the most vicious beast of all time - and neither will survive while the other is alive.",
