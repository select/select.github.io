      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, as well as getting a head start on some 1930 films, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This religious film is notable for the way that they presented religion with a dramatic flair for black audiences across America. It was co-created by husband and wife filmmakers James and Eloyce Gist, and is therefore one of the few surviving silent films by an African-American woman. While it is a proselytizing picture, the imagery should prove interesting even to those without a religious background.",
