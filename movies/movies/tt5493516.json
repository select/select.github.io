There's a mother whose five-year-old boy has leukemia, two doctors - one an atheist haunted by his past, the other a brilliant young oncologist who places all her hope in the power of modern medicine - and a blind pastor whose son hasn't spoken a single word in 38 years. All of them will be brought together by the presence of this stranger, who teaches them the true meaning of faith and hope.",
