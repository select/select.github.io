Cahn\n\nWhen his twin brother is killed by an escaped convict, a farmer goes gunnin' for his brother's murderer, but his only clue is a stolen revolver that is part of a matched pair. Along the way, he teams up with a Native American damsel in distress, a notorious gunslinger (Mike Connors), and an old Wild West Show. \n\nOne of the least-known of the American-International \"B\" westerns of the 1950s, Flesh and the Spur offers the spectacle of the inimitable John Agar in a dual role.",
