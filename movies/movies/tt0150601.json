    "Plot": "A traveling salesman offers a magical oil to the animals that lets them fly. The results discombobulate Farmer Al Falfa in this happily absurd Terrytoon.1935 showed a definite uptick in the quality of cartoons from the Paul Terry studio. Although there were plenty of bread-and-butter cartoons that were no more than slightly polished versions of cartoons that Terry had produced ten years earlier, better efforts, such as this one, showed occasional flights of fancy -- and pigs. The animation is more fluid than in previous years. The overwhelming use of operetta music that had typified much of 1934 was cut back because it wasn't needed. New characters were designed more simply and engagingly; the salesman here had appeared in DOG SHOW as a dog catcher and is clearly intended as a new contract actor who might become a star.",
