      "description": "Les Filles du Roi | Musical Drama | Award Winning Musical Movie\n\nAdapted from the award-winning musical by Corey Payette and Julie McIsaac, Les Filles du Roi (The King’s Daughters) tells the powerful story of a young girl, Kateri and her brother Jean-Baptiste whose lives are disrupted upon the arrival of les filles du roi in ‘New France’ (now Montreal) in 1665. They forge an unlikely relationship with the young fille Marie-Jean Lespérance—whose dream of a new life is more complicated than she could have imagined. Over the course of a year, Mohawk, French, and English journeys collide, setting the stage for the Canada we know today.\n\n2023.
