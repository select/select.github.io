    "Plot": "When a horde of cartoon mice overrun his studio, Walter Lantz -- in a beret, mustache and artist's robes -- orders Dinky Doodle to rid the place of them.This Bray cartoon was produced during the period when they were dealing with the loss of the Fleischer's Koko, a mixture of live action and cartoons that were arguably the best series in animation at the time. Lantz invented Dinky Doodle, a cartoon boy in striped shirt and cap, with a small dog. His stories, though they were cleverly executed, were the standard stuff of the era, nor did he grasp the logical absurdities of either Dave Fleischer nor Otto Messmer. The result is an average, decent cartoon of the era, with a couple of good gags. I credit Clyde Geronimi, who went with Lantz when he set up his cartoon studio for Universal, then later became a Disney loyalist.",
