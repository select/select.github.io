She gets tired of playing alone and schemes to have Andrew, the suitor of her Aunt Cissie, play with her. Andrew would rebel, but the injunction that he must amuse the kid, Bessie, or get out, makes him consent. The stunts she puts him through make him worthy of the bestowal of Cissie's hand in marriage.",
