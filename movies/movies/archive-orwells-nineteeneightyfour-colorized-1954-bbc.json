      "description": "George Orwell’s novel 1984 was brought to television on 12 December 1954, written by Nigel Kneale and directed by Rudolph Cartier. Its vision of a future authoritarian state shocked viewers, particularly the scenes where the hero Winston Smith was tortured in the infamous Room 101. Some MPs and members of the press complained and Cartier received death threats, but the controversy helped the play. When it was repeated days later it drew the largest audience since the Coronation. 1984 was broadcast live, as was usual at the time, so the repeat was a new performance. Cartier helped the pace of the drama by using pre-cut scenes inserted into the action, making time for more complicated changes between the live sections. Winston Smith was played by Peter Cushing with Yvonne Mitchell as his lover Julia. Andre Morrell was intimidating as Smith’s tormentor O’Brien.",
