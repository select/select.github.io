      "description": "This film is of particular interest from a historians perspective as it shows wonderful shots of what New York city was like in the early 1930's. We take a time travel trip back to around 1935 and travel by boat in Southerly direction over the Hudson river, starting to the North of the George Washington Bridge. We then pass Grant's Tomb. Later on in this film we pass the Chelsey piers from where, before around 1935, most Ocean liners departed to many destinations in Europe across the Atlantic Ocean. The second part of the film shows New York's piers and ferry´s at the very South of Manhatten. The film finishes with splended footage of a journey up the East River and the Harlem river. For more information, please watch the film and listen to the spoken commentary. Source: Archive.org Music: Kikuru (many great tunes).",
