      "description": "When a painter (Ross Elliott) goes on the run after witnessing a gangland murder, his wife (Ann Sheridan) suspects that he may really be running away from their unsuccessful marriage, and goes looking for him all over San Francisco with the help of a newspaperman (Dennis O'Keefe). But she is being followed both by a policeman (Robert Keith) and by the killer. Ann Sheridan as Eleanor Johnson Dennis O'Keefe as Dan Legget Robert Keith as Inspector Ferris John Qualen as Maibus Frank Jenks as Detective Shaw Ross Elliott as Frank Johnson I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
