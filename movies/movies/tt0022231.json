Directed by: Rudolf Ising Actors: Production Company: Warner Bros. Release Date: 3 October 1931 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.20 : 1 Foxy is a policeman on the beat. He has no trouble with a single criminal who pops out of a trashcan and sprays bullets at him with a machine gun. Foxy has his own gun. It shoots out an expandable arm with a platform on the end. A mouse with a mallet stands on the platform and knocks the criminal unconscious. Foxy has a bit more trouble with a hippo who runs him over. She begs him not to fine her. He gives in, but throws a trashcan over her head to show his contempt. Foxy's real trouble begins with a gang of criminals armed with a grenade, a machine gun and mouthfuls of tobacco juice. They kidnap Foxy's girlfriend. The bushy-tailed cop hops on a wooden horse, and the chase is on.",
