      "description": "A nice collection of colorized images of steam trams in the Netherlands around the 1920s in color. The original B / W films are estored and colored by means of A.I. software. The quality of the source material varied per fragment, making some parts better than others. Successively you will see steam trams in: - The bulb region (area of ​​Hillegom) in 1924, - Haarlem in 1918, - Rijswijk in 1922, - Amsterdam in the 1920s, - Deventer in 1926, - Coevorden in the 1920s, - Zutphen in the 1920s, - Gelderland (GTM), ca.1950, - Scheveningen (last steam tram ride) in 1925. Note: This film was first in B / W on our channel, but has now been replaced by a colored version. Unfortunately we have not been allowed to keep the B / W version on this YouTube channel due to their ban on \"re-used content\". Music: Gerard Franklin",
