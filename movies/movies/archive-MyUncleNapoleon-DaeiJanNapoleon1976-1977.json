      "description": "Synopsis A masterpiece movie based on Iraj Pezeshkzad's novel \"My dear Uncle Napoleon\". An uproarious adoption of a popular novel by Iraj Pezeshkzad set in and around the family compound in early 1940s Tehran, marvelously rich in personality and incident. The title character, so-called because of his constant invocation of the general, rules over a wonderfully complex extended family. A hilarious series which makes fun of just about everything.
