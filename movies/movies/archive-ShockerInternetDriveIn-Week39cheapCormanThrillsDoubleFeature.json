      "description": "Well as summer heats up and winds down, we thought some good old cheap thrills might be in order. And, who else is the master of cheap and thrills than the great Roger Corman. That's right! We are happy to bring you another classic Corman double feature. First up, after some coming attractions from Roger and a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we proudly present 1961's \"Creature From The Haunted Sea\" - an off-beat comedy with one of the worst looking monsters ever committed to film stock. Then, after a brief intermission, we present 1959's \"The Wasp Woman\" - Corman's female answer to the fly (with a cameo from Roger himself!) As always we invite you to bring (almost) the whole family and don't forget to visit our snackbar for lots of great food, soda, popcorn and candy. Oh, and remember to turn right when you leave the good ol' Shocker Internet Drive In! NEW WEB ADDRESS: http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://www.shockerredirect.tk/",
