Richard Jones, assisted by Ray Grey, photography Homer Scott, auth. Mary Hunt and Fred Stowers, film edtr. Allen McNeil, Titles John Gray, Art Director S. D. Barnes, Costumes Violet Schrader cast: Mabel Normand (Molly O), Jack Mulhall (Dr. John S. Bryant), George Nichols (Tim O'Dair), Lowell Sherman (Fred Mancester), Eddie Gribbon (Jim Smith), Anna Hernandez (Mrs. Tim O'Dair), Jacqueline Logan (Miriam Mancester), Albert Hackett (Billy O'Dair), Ben Deeley (Albert Faulkner), Carl Stockdale (The Silhouette Man), Eugenie Besserer (Antonia Bacigalupi), Gloria Davenport (Mrs. James Wheaton Robbins) filmed: 5/30 to 6/29, 1921 Locations: Los Angeles, CA, Pensacola, FL copyright: Oct. 24, 1921 This copy is from the print that surfaced at the Gosfilmofund in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990's; and at least a pair of reels are missing. However, their absence occurs in the early part of the movie and does not seriously impair watching the film in toto. Until UCLA comes out on DVD with their restored version (and why, after all, don't they?), this is about as good a print as one's likely to see. For the script and title cards in English, see: http://www.angelfire.com/mn/hp/mollyotxt.html Special thanks to Marilyn Slater, Mabel Normand archivist and historian, for making this upload possible. Note. The version for .avi download here is somewhat better in picture quality than the one presented on video.",

Events come to a head at the charity masked ball, which the two girls happen to attend in very similar costumes, thanks to the largesse of Molly's benevolent \"fairy godfather\"; Molly is mistaken for her rival, much to the indignation both of her working-class would-be suitor and the doctor's would-be bride. However, the repercussions that follow serve only to thrust her into her dream man's arms, and all looks set for a fairytale ending... until the disgruntled rival finds a way to get back at Molly through her family...",
