      "description": "Three heroic daredevils (Charles Quigley, Bruce Bennett, David Sharpe) work with the daughter (Carole Landis) of an industrialist (Miles Mander) being held captive by a diabolical mastermind (Charles Middleton) who escaped from prison determined to destroy all the projects of the man who put him there, and is now using a disguise to impersonate the man. featurized (2 hrs 45 min) version of the original 12-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
