      "description": "“Kind of creepy” (IMDB review quote). An independent venture intended to showcase the singing talent of child star Bobby Breen whose brief Hollywood career abruptly ended the instant he hit puberty. Good cast and production, nevertheless I agree with the IMDB reviewer. It’s kind of creepy. Nominated for one Oscar (best original score) IMDB rating 5.3. Directed by Edward F Cline. Released in 1938. Complete print. TRIVIA: First telecast 25 August 1947 by NYC’s WNBT channel 4.",
