Directed by: Frank Capra, Anatole Litvak Actors: Production Company: U.S. War Department Release Date: 27 May 1942 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 This famous propaganda piece, used as a U.S. Army training film in WWII before theatrical release, asks 'why we fight.' The answer compares the 'free' and 'slave' worlds.
