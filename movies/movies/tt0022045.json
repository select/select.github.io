    "Plot": "Things are hopping at a certain Mexican café. All the animals are singing. The tables are swaying to the music. The ape-waiter is dancing down the aisles as confetti and ribbons continually fall from the ceiling. And then Foxy walks in and the customers really go wild. He sings \"A Gay Caballero\" as he walks down the aisle. By the time he gets to his table, the show is ready to begin. The performer is a beautiful girl-fox singing \"Lady, Play Your Mandolin.\" Foxy sings along, as his horse busts in and gets drunk.",
