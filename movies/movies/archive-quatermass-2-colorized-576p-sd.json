      "description": "Quatermass 2 (retitled Enemy From Space in the United States and Canada) is a 1957  black-and-white  British  science fiction   horror film  drama from  Hammer Film Productions . It was originally released in the UK as Quatermass II and was produced by  Anthony Hinds , directed by  Val Guest , and stars  Brian Donlevy  with co-stars  John Longden ,  Sidney James ,  Bryan Forbes ,  Vera Day , and  William Franklyn . Quatermass 2 is a sequel to Hammer's earlier film  The Quatermass Xperiment  (1955). Like its predecessor, it is based on the  BBC Television  serial  Quatermass II  written by  Nigel Kneale . Brian Donlevy reprises his role as the eponymous Professor  Bernard Quatermass , making him the only actor to play the character twice in a film. It is often erroneously considered as the first film sequel to use the '2' / 'II' suffix within the title, though this distinction belongs to  Sanshiro Sugata Part II .",
