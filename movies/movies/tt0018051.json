      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Regarded as possibly Harold Lloyd's best film, The Kid Brother was a commercial and critical hit upon release. Unfortunately it has mostly been forgotten since then except for the most dutiful of silent film fans. In the picture, Lloyd plays a weak and cowardly youngest sibling of a rough and tumble family. When a girl from a traveling medicine show attracts his attention, he has to learn how to be brave. ",
