      "description": "A government scientist working on a top secret project at the Royal Institute for Space Research, meets a mysterious woman and is married quickly even though he knows little of her past. Since his predecessor died mysteriously, the head of security want to know more about his wife, especially certain strange attributes that suggest she may be more than she appears. When it turns out she actually does love her husband, they both become targets of those who do not want the project to succeed. John Neville as Dr. Mark Davidson Philip Stone as Prof. John Lancaster Gabriella Licudi as Julie Davidson Patrick Newell as Maj. Clarke Jean Marsh as Miss Ballard I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
