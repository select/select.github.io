      "description": "This version has improved contrast. “Lurid and badly acted” ”Dreadful” “Amazingly bad” (IMDB reviews quotes). Laughably awful pre-code exploitation. (see NOTE) The miracle is it didn’t kill Douglas Fairbanks Jr’s career. Is it so bad it’s good? Yes! If you get a perverse kick out of wacky plots and atrocious acting you’ll love this gobbler. At the very least you’ll come away wondering what the hell were they thinking? IMDB rating 5.4. Produced and directed by Victor Halperin. Released in 1930. Six minutes are missing. AKA “Dangerous Business”. NOTE: A better pre-code melodrama with approximately the same theme is here: https://archive.org/details/MoralsForWomen_452  ",
