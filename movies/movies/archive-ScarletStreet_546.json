      "description": "Scarlet Street - D W Griffith - 1919 - From IMDB \"A romantic bandit named Alvarez, wanted for raids on the mining camps of the California gold rush in 1849, is reformed by the love of a good woman.\" I am not sure why I am uploading this film. It is considered by many to be Griffith's worst. Perhaps history drives me. At any rate you have been warned.",
