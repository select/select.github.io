The film was directed by Anthony Mann and shot by noted noir cameraman John Alton . The production features Dennis O'Keefe , Mary Meade , Alfred Ryder , Wallace Ford , June Lockhart and Charles McGraw . A year later, director Mann used the film's male lead, Dennis O'Keefe, in Raw Deal . The film was endorsed by the U.S. Treasury Department : the opening credits are displayed over an image of the department's seal, then former Chief Coordinator of the department's six agencies Elmer Lincoln Irey delivers a monologue describing the objectives of those agencies and lauding their accomplishments. He describes the movie as a composite case from its files entitled \"The Shanghai Paper Case\".",
