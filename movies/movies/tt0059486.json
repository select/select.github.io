      "description": "“Nice little movie” “Satisfactory sixties quickie” “Unconventional” “Not as bad as I expected” (IMDB reviews quotes). The fungus among us isn’t a mushroom omelet in this low-budget sci-fi adventure that’s not bad considering. (see TRIVIA) Large, okay cast. The production values are adequate for the plot. This print’s audio quality could be better. IMDB rating 5.0. Directed by Hugo Grimaldi (and Arthur C Pierce uncredited); Released in 1965. Complete print. TRIVIA: Filmed in six days with a reputed budget of less than $90,000. CAST NOTE: Harold Lloyd Jr’s final film.",
