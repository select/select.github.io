      "description": "Wonderful film footage of Vienna, the capital of Austria, well before both World Wars! The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, slightly speed corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of sophisticated A.I. video software. The film takes us by tram through the streets of Vienna and shows many of its beautiful buildings. As of today, most of these buildings still exist. For more information, see the timeline below. Original Title: Eine Fahrt durch Wien / Vienne en Tramway. Music: Leimoti - Winter Waltz, Old Vienna and Waltz for Celia.
