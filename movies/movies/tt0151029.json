    "Plot": "I thought this cartoon is a very nice, completely enjoyable little musical from Paul Terry, that is now another favorite. Also I meant this in a good way, that it's so campy, it's wonderfully goofy.They story is basically an operatic take on a cat \"singing\" to a female. But her annoyed, sleep-deprived owner tries to keep her away from him. Well in the beginning, every cat in the city is going to a kitty-cat opera and the female lead wanted to go, but her owner confines her inside.So that is all I have to say about this cartoon, and that I love this cartoon way better than the Warner Bros. cartoon \"Notes to You\" and its color remake \"Back Alley Oproar.\" Overall, I love this cartoon - campiness and all.",
