      "description": "Cash on Demand is a 1961 British black and white second feature neo noir crime thriller film directed by Quentin Lawrence and starring Peter Cushing and André Morell . The screenplay was adapted from the Sept.24, 1960 Associated Television Theatre 70 teleplay The Gold Inside , also directed by Lawrence, and featuring André Morell and Richard Vernon in the same roles. Filming ran from April 4, 1961 to April 16, 1961, and although Hammer considered it one of their best films, it wasn't distributed in UK for some reason until December 13, 1963, and even today it is not shown frequently at all on TV. The British print was 18 minutes shorter than the US print.",
