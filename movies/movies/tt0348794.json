    "Plot": "The scene opens in the bedroom of Mr. Nation, husband of the famous Carrie Nation, the \"Kansas Saloon Smasher.\" Mr. Nation suddenly arises from the bed and picks up a crying infant from the cradle, and walks it up and down the floor. He suddenly steps upon a tack, becomes infuriated, and throws the baby back into the cradle. A small boy in the bed next demands his attention. The overworked husband becomes exasperated, and seizes a bottle of whiskey just as Mrs. Nation enters. She is horrified at the sight of her husband drinking from a bottle. She smashes the bottle on the floor, turns her husband over her knee and spanks him soundly.",
