    "Plot": "Children in the Surf at Coney Island (1904)* 1/2 (out of 4)I think between 1903-1905 we got some of the lesser years in terms of movie quality. Pre-1903 we got films that captured everyday events but they ran for a minute and were pretty harmless. As the years went on these type of films would get dragged out to four and five minutes and it's clear to see that these types of films were going away as stories became the big thing.This film has a camera set up on the beach where a group of children stand waiting for the tide to come in. This is obviously a cute film as the kids are clearly having fun but at the same time it's downright boring and especially as it just continues to drag along without any real purpose.",
