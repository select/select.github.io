      "description": "An ex-con trying to go straight is framed for a million dollar armored car robbery and must go to Mexico and make his way past a web of hired thugs and a corrupt cop to discover who set him up, and why. John Payne as Joe Rolfe Coleen Gray as Helen Foster Preston Foster as Tim Foster Neville Brand as Boyd Kane Lee Van Cleef as Tony Romano Jack Elam as Pete Harris Dona Drake as Teresa Mario Siletti as Tomaso I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
