It is one of the most entertaining pictures that has been screened for some time. It is bright, well directed, with a wonderful cast, rich sets, and many wholesome laughs.  The picture is chockful of entertainment, and a great deal of credit is due to the portrayals of the various roles by an unusually good cast of screen favorites.  Marceline Day, who plays the title role, is beautiful, charming, and a screen player of great promise.  The rest of the players are well cast.  The direction is of the best. (Queensland Figaro)     The story is well plotted, the situations novel, and the picture highly entertaining.  The continuity excellent. (Telegraph)     Marceline Day is charming, a very good actress and chock full of appeal. (Variety)     The film is excellent entertainment for any theater. It has spirited action, good characterizations and a human and comical story. (Moving Picture World)     Pleasing story, nicely told. Light tale that has plenty of attractive angles to entertain general run of audiences.  The film is important in that it brings to the fore a new luminary in the person of Marceline Day in the leading role, that of a drab, unattractive sartorially, and, because of that, physically, cashier who from the chrysalis becomes the most gorgeous and radiant of butterflies.
