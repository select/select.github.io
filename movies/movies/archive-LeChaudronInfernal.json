      "description": "The Infernal Boiling Pot (Le Chaudron Infernal) is a 1903 silent French fantasy film directed by Georges Méliès. The film shows a green-skinned demon who places a woman and then two courtiers into a burning cauldron. He performs an incantation and three spirits suddenly appear from the flames, before dancing above his head. Frolicking in hellish joy, the demon watches as the three spirits burn up and fall to earth.
