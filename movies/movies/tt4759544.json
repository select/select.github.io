      "description": "Village of the Vampire - Rebecca is searching for her sister, a young journalist who went missing while investigating a series of unfortunate events. The trail leads her to Timere, a remote place far from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, where amidst the tight lipped silence of the town's inhabitants there's an ever growing fear of dark forces at work and  no-one dares to leave their home at night. Here Rebecca meets an extravagant writer, the church warden of the town and above all Caleb, a charming, rich and  elegant man whose dark gaze hides a chilling secret. It's in this town, where time appears to move between the shadows and danger lurks around every corner that Rebecca learns of the terrible truth and the battle between good and evil  begins.\n2020.
