      "description": "Zane Grey's To the Last Man (1933) - Randolph Scott In Kentucky just after the Civil War, the Hayden-Colby feud leads to Jed Colby (Noah Beery) being sent to prison for 15 years for murder. The Haydens head for Nevada and when Colby gets out of prison he heads there also seeking revenge. The head of the Hayden family tries to avoid more killing but the inevitable showdown has to occur, complicated by Lynn Hayden (Randolph Scott) and Ellen Colby's (Esther Ralston) plans to marry. Buster Crabbe plays Bill Hayden (Lynn Hayden's brother). A very young Shirley Temple plays Mary Stanley (in an un-credited role).",
