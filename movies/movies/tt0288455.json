      "description": "Boers Bringing In British Prisoners (1900) Boers Bringing In British Prisoners is a black-and-white silent short docu-fiction film produced by James H. White for Edison Manufacturing Company in 1900. Here we have a mixed company of Gordon Highlanders, Irish Fusilliers and English Lancers, as a group of prisoners taken to the rear by a troop of Boer Cavalry. The expression on their faces show who is the victor, and who is the vanquished. You can read in the dust and smoke-begrimed countenance of the prisoners, the story of their stubborn resistance to superior numbers before the surrender: while the Boers give expression to their feelings, by cheering and waving their hats in triumph as they pass.",
