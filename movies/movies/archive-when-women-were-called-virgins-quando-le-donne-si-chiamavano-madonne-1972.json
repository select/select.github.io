      "description": "A very little and nice village in Italy, Middle Ages. A woman is under legal action for adultery, three young men trying to seduce three beautiful girls, one of them is the daughter of an unfaithful 'Madonna' (ancient Italian for lady) and another is a virgin scared about sex. The attempts to seduce the girls cross with the two lady's intrigues, but the goal is for all to have sex with others.  This one may have been social commentary. The setting is maybe early 1800's but the target is the leftover puritanical morals of  1870's Italy. Italian language with optional English Subtitles",
