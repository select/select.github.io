      "description": "The original title of this film is \"Father Nile\". It shows what life was like in Egypt almost a century ago. The film begins with Felucca sailing boats on the river Nile, followed by caravans of camels and donkeys taking goods to market. Next we see men turning a huge wheel to manually turn and open a characteristic bridge with statues of lions at its entrance, followed by huge Felucca boats transporting rocks, then a local gathering of fishermen with a huge moored fleet, a picturesq draw bridge, a very long bridge, rural life among the many palm trees, agricultural activity supervised by an elderly gentleman, an ox and plough, a water wheel turned by an ox, scenes on the banks of the river Nile, a scene with many local people, an endeering scene  of a mother and child holding baby goats, a camel and its calf, a group of Egyptian children praying and finally a fisherman casting out his net. It you have any more useful information, then do let us know! The original B&W film has been speed-corrected, motion-stabilized, restored, enhanced and colorized by means of state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence video software.
