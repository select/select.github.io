      "description": "In 1868, a cowardly army commander (Lloyd Bridges) accidentally kills a Cheyenne Indian chief (Frank DeKova), and the tribe vows to take revenge on the town. But the town marshal (Rory Calhoun), who is having problems with his wife (Gloria Grahame) and secretly loves the dead man's daughter (Joanne Gilbert), is unable to get the townspeople to heed his warning and must find some way to stop the impending massacre. Rory Calhoun as Marshal Tate Gloria Grahame as Amy Porter Lloyd Bridges as Capt. George Joanne Gilbert as Pretty Willow Vince Edwards as Chief Little Wolf Richard Shannon as Garvin Frank DeKova as Chief Yellow Wolf Michael Winkelman as Billy Cyril Delevanti as Preacher I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
