      "description": "Hello and welcome back to everyone's favorite drive-in \"Spook House\". Tonight we are cutting our prices and bringing two low budget classics, created and filmed specifically for you drive in enjoyment. After the usual coming attractions and a Casper cartoon, our first feature is that wonderfully confused period piece, made in Texas by the way, \"The Dungeon of Harrow\". Then, after a snack bar break, that classic is followed by another exercise in cheap thrills and bad acting, \"The Ghosts of Hanley House\". You folks are guaranteed to get your money's worth on this double feature, so grab your sodas and hot dogs, clean your car's windows, and enjoy the show! http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://shockerdrivein.primehost24.tk",
