      "description": "Starring John Richardson and Gordon Mitchell, an Italian up to date (from 1970s viewpoint) variation of Mary Shelley's classic novel. A bit sleazy and at times overlong but worth watching. The widescreen aspect ratio is unfortunately cut on both sides, but all in all, a decent copy. more info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071518/",
