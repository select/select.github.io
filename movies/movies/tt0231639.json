    "Plot": "A clerk looks over the bank of stacked shoe boxes on the wall behind him. Two women enter, perhaps a mother and her grown daughter, one in white and one in black, both wearing large hats. The younger of the two asks to see shoes while the older one, sitting on the far side of the clerk, reads. He shows the younger woman a sample, then another. She selects the second, and he puts it on her foot, taking his time with the buttons and buckles. She slowly raises her skirt to display her ankle and then her calf. He looks up at her. Wait a second - is he a heel or is this a planned assignation?",
