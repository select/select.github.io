      "description": "Bashful Directed by Alfred J. Goulding Written by H. M. Walker Produced by Hal Roach Starring Harold Lloyd Cinematography Walter Lundin Distributed by Pathé Exchange Release date December 23, 1917 Running time 1 reel Country United States Language Silent (English intertitles) Bashful is a 1917 American short comedy film featuring Harold Lloyd . A copy exists in the film archive of the Museum of Modern Art , New York City. [ 1 ] Plot Harold plays a shy but well-off bachelor who has been invited to a party hosted by The Girl ( Bebe Daniels ). While there, Harold receives a telegram informing him that he is about to inherit a fortune from a distant and recently deceased aunt—provided he is married and has a baby. The Girl agrees to act as his wife when his uncle arrives to inspect their household. Harold's valet (Snub) procures an entire room full of toddlers to play the role of the couple's child—including a black infant. His uncle sees the numerous children. Instead of being suspicious, since Harold claims he's only been married for two years, his uncle hands him the check and says he will certainly need the money.

    "Plot": "With the help of his butler Snub, Harold is getting all dressed up for a girl's fancy birthday party. Once at the party, Harold is too bashful to accept a kiss from the girl. Although he wants to have a good time at the party, he is also too shy to get or do what he really wants. Things have the potential to change when he receives word from his Uncle Bill of his imminent visit, and the fact that Harold's aunt just died leaving him an inheritance of $2 million, only if he's married and has a baby. The girl is willing to be his wife - which may result in the kiss she wants from him - but finding a suitable baby may be more difficult. But once Snub gets the hang of finding babies, the problems may be which babies constitute Harold's family, and having to deal with a mob of worried mothers in the process.",
