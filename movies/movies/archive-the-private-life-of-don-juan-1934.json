      "description": "As news spreads through Seville, Spain, that Don Juan (Douglas Fairbanks) is in town, husbands lock up their wives, unaware the famed lover is in poor health. Both Juan's private servant and his doctor urge him to settle down with his own wife, Dolores (Benita Hume), but he is determined to maintain  his reputation. When an impostor posing as Juan is killed, he takes the opportunity to retire. However, after six months, a bored Juan wishes to return -- but finds no one believes his identity.",
