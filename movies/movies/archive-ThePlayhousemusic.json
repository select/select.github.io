      "description": "The Playhouse is a 1921 Buster Keaton short. It has a very notable scene at the beginning where Buster plays all the cast,crew, band and audience in the playhouse. The scene where 9 Busters dance together was meticulously filmed with Buster doing the same dance 9 times in front of a camera which had a slit open in front of the lens which was moved for each dance. Not only did the dances have to be the same, the cameraman had to crank the camera at the same rate each time. The movie is already in the archive but I have added some music.",
