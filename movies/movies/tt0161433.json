    "Plot": "This \"Aesop's Fable\" cartoon from the Van Beuren Studios was fairly weak and, I'm sure offensive to Asian people of today. You get all the Chinese stereotypes here with the \"Me no likey you boyfriend\" type of speech to the exaggerated slanted eyes, dragons, laundry businesses, etc. However, you go have the non-Asian lover-boy going after the Chinese girl and fighting off her parents to get her, so at least she is pictured as someone of worth. This animated short dragged until some villain dragged off the girl and the boy went after her. That seems to be a common theme in these \"Fables\" cartoons. You also get a song or two. Here, it's done not in real Chinese but some sort of degrading Asian phrases strung together to make lyrics.A weak, and embarrassing effort.",
