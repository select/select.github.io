      "description": "PLOT : Works of art are disappearing, stolen by a master thief, a master of disguise. Father Brown has two goals: to catch the thief and to save his soul. --IMDb TRIVIA : 01) Sir Alec Guinness was spotted in costume while walking home through the French countryside. A young boy ran up to him, yelling \"Mon père! Mon père!\" (\"My father! My father!\") Guinness did not speak French, so he could not correct his mistake, but was touched that the boy apparently immediately bonded to him on the assumption that he was a priest. Soon after this movie was released, Guinness converted to Catholicism. 02) Loosly based on the short story \"The Blue Cross\" by G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936) first published in 1910. 03) The parable about the woman and the onion Fr. Brown relates to Flambeau is from \"The Brothers Karamazov\" by Fyodor Dosteovsky (1821-1881) .--IMDb **Uploaded for educational purposes only; I own zero rights to this film and receive zero for the upload, other than the joy of sharing a great movie with all present & future generations.--def gp - ddh**",
