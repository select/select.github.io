      "description": "According to a long-ago thread (archive.org/post/301239/is-this-public-domain) “Monsters Crash the Pajama Party” is PD. It's an artifact from the days of live “spook shows” in movie theaters, and would have needed a big infusion of cash to qualify as “low budget.”  It’s loaded with intentional goofy humor (the “mad doctor” character wears a lab coat that’s embroidered with “MAD DOCTOR,” for example; one of his beakers is labeled “colored water”), and has something to do with his efforts to turn the teen cuties into gorillas. Apparently, the doc’s   laser cannon was supposed to blast a hole right through the movie screen, thereby freeing the monsters to roam through the audience and steal another subject for his experiments. Count Floyd would love this.   ",
