      "description": "Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch are discovered after months of living on the roof of Broadcasting House with their chickens and Lewis the goat, waiting for their chance at stardom. On their subsequent aimless travels in their overladen car, the Askeytoff II, they end up renting the haunted Droom Castle for the princely sum of £3. The perfectly natural explanation for the ghost is that Nazis are at the bottom of it all (in the basement), using a TV hook-up to Berlin. Of course Arthur has a much better idea: put on a pirate TV station and broadcast a music show that night in competition with the stuffy old BBC.",
