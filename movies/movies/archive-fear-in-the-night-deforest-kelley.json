      "description": "Before he was Bones on Star Trek, DeForest was a star of B horror. If you're a Star Trek fan, like me, you'll want to watch everything any of the stars of Star Trek ever acted in. (Also, if you're a true fan, then, like me, you'll agree that the new Star Trek spinoffs of the past few years are garbage!) Suspense, horror, crime, mystery,  cops, Detectives,  noir, fright, murder,  well...what else can you want?!",
