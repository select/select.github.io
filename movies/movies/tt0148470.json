    "Plot": "Van Bueren Studios' Cubby the Bear series comprised of just 19 (not the 17 as initially thought, having worked from an incomplete list listing the cartoons) cartoons made between 1933-1934. As much as it pains me to say it, speaking as a big animation fan, it is not hard to see why the character and the series weren't so popular and didn't last long.Despite my love for animation, there are only to me a few above mediocre Cubby cartoons, 'The Nut Factory', 'Fresh Ham', 'Croon Crazy' and 'Goode Knight'. 'Mild Cargo' is not one of Cubby's worst, 'Love's Labour Won' , 'Cubby's Picnic' and 'Galloping Fanny' are worse, but to me it is a long way from good, let alone great. The best thing about it, and this is true of a lot of Van Bueren's output, is the music score. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and full of lively energy that is sorely lacking elsewhere, doing so well with enhancing the action.A couple of supporting characters are fun to watch and some of the gags are more amusing and better timed than in most Cubby cartoons. Outside of those things there is not much to recommend. The animation generally is really not good even for a cartoon not made on a high budget, and it is true for the Cubby the Bear series and Van Bueren in general on the whole. It's static in movement, simplistic in background detail and sloppy in drawing, with the character expressions being pretty expressionless.Another major problem is Cubby himself, on top of being poorly animated he is one of the blandest, most personality-deprived there is. Most of the supporting characters are stock and too many of the gags are bland and routine, generally there's not enough of them too. The story is paper thin and obvious, also like many Cubby cartoons it doesn't go very far. To conclude, mediocre and very mild but not unwatchable. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
