      "description": "Cecil B Demille's first feature film as a director and producer From Wikipedia: Directed by Oscar Apfel and Cecil B. DeMille and produced by DeMille and Jesse L. Lasky, the screenplay was adapted by Beulah Marie Dix from the 1905 stage play, of the same name, written by Edwin Milton Royle. This first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille's first movie assignment. It also holds the distinction of being the first feature-length movie filmed specifically in Hollywood. It was not the first to be made in the Los Angeles area, and film historians agree that shorts had previously been filmed in Hollywood, with In Old California considered the earliest. Harbor scenes were shot in San Pedro, California and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the San Fernando Valley. Footage of cattle on the open range were shot at Keen Camp near Idyllwild, California, while snow scenes were shot at Mount Palomar. The Squaw Man went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director/producer, DeMille. He did a silent remake in 1918, and a talkie version in 1931.",

      "description": "The Squaw Man (1914) - Directed by Cecil B. DeMille & Oscar Apfel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squaw_Man_(1914_film) https://www.cecilbdemille.com/portfolio-item/the-squaw-man/ Deinterlaced using Handbrake - (Decomb + Preset: EEDI2) Upscaled and enhanced using Topaz Video AI - (AI Model: Iris + Recover Original Detail 20 + Grain: Amount 7, Size 2) Topaz Video AI is software that uses artificial intelligence to enhance the quality of video footage. These settings produced the result that I was happiest with. Additional tweaking along with different settings may have improved the results further, however, I don't have the time nor the experience for that kind of experimentation. I added the layer of film grain to improve the visuals: it replaces the original grain that is often lost during the denoising process AND it prevents the picture from looking too cartoonish/waxy which can be caused by the enhancement process. Overall I am very impressed with the results - comparing it with the source video it's like night and day. I highly recommend Topaz Video AI.
