      "description": "The old lady who lives in a shoe has a bit of trouble with her gaggle of children. They won't eat their porridge, won't brush their teeth or comb their hair. As soon as their mother's in bed, they launch a wild party, playing musical instruments and doing a swinging rendition of Smiley Burnette's classic \"Mama Don't Allow No Music Playing Round Here.\" They then have a massive pillow fight until the old woman wakes up.
