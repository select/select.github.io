    "Plot": "A young bespectacled man lives on the beach, where courtship rituals between boys and girls abound. Seeing that the girls are attracted to a man in uniform, namely a life guard's uniform, the young man dons a life guard t-shirt he finds which does indeed make him more attractive to the girls. There is one in particular he is interested in, a sardine-eyed doll, who in turn doesn't like boys that are too fresh. To help a man who has been waiting for the shower at the beach's bathhouse, the young man changes the signs on all the doors of the bathhouse. The misadventures that ensue due to this act leads to the young man being pursued by a beach police officer. The young man is eventually able to elude the police officer donning yet another disguise. But the young man has to decide if he will give up the disguise when the sardine-eyed doll gets caught in a precarious situation out in the surf.",
