      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the few American films ever made that centers around the game of polo, in 'The Smart Set', an American polo player becomes too arrogant and disrespects his team. Eventually he is thrown off the team and his life is then thrown into turmoil. Audiences came out to nearly any movie starring William Haines at this point in time, though critics felt that this picture was a little too similar to his other films. ",
