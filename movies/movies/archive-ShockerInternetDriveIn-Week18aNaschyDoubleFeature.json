      "description": "What better way to warm up a cold February evening than to load up the car with your \"Main Squeeze\" and head on down to the ol' Shocker Drive In for some scary Spainish fun. This week, we are happy to bring you a real \"Naschy\" double treat featuring the Spainish Lon Chaney - Paul Naschy. After some choice previews of some of Paul's more famous flicks, we present the wide screen version of that 1970 monster fest \"Assignment Terror\" (also featuring Michael Rennie), followed by the 1973 boob and blood feast - \"Count Dracula's Great Love\" (Parental Guidance suggested). So park the car, get your snacks from our fabulous concession stand and hold on to your loved one tight for one heck of a bloody Valentine!
