    "Plot": "In 1882, in Muncie, Indiana, Jesse James and his gang rob a telegraph express office of its cash. During the escape, gang member Victor 'Vic' Rodell is wounded. He is taken to gang member Bob Ford's home in Rayville, Missouri, to convalesce. Jesse James, Frank James and Cole Younger ride on with the loot. In Muncie, town Sheriff Steve Oliver and Pinkerton Agent Clyde O'Connell decide to join forces and go after the James gang. At the Ford ranch, gang member Victor 'Vic' Rodell falls in-love with Bob Ford's sister, Paula. She is a young pretty widow whose husband, a bank teller, was murdered some years before, during a bank robbery, by none other than Jesse James. Upon learning this fact, Rodell decides to go straight in life and to surrender to state Governor Crittenden of Missouri with a plea for clemency. Paula agrees to aid Rodell by interceding with the Governor. After listening to her plea, the Governor promises to pardon Rodell, as well as Bob Ford, on the condition that Jesse James is delivered to him dead or alive. Paula delivers the Governor's message to Rodell who hesitates about hunting down Jesse James. However, Bob Ford decides to accept the Governor's offer and goes after Jesse James. He also knows that, in any event, the other gang members would eventually seek revenge.",
