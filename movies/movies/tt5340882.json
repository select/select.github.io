But, an ill monkey will soon lead to virulent contamination, as the deadly disease that starts to infect the animals one by one, is turning them into ravenous undead predators. Now, it's up to Dr Ellen Rogers and her skeleton crew to fight the virus and the zoo's zombified inhabitants before they escape. Are humans next in the long list of endangered species?",
