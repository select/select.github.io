    "Plot": "Just watched this Terrytoon/Heckle and Jeckle cartoon on Daily Motion as linked from the Cartoons, Model Sheets, and Stuff site. In this one, a couple of dogs put Wanted posters of the two magpies on various trees. Guess who's fishing nearby. From there, it's a non-stop chase for the four characters...Many of these Terrytoon shorts get so much attention on these cartoon sites despite their not-too-quality-oriented reputation is because many of their authors are fans of the animation of one Jim Tyler and I must say, this Jim guy is pretty good! One scene in particular is very funny to me which I'll just say involves one of the dogs' teeth and some samba dancing. So on that note, I highly recommend A Merry Chase.",
