      "description": "The Unseen Enemy, Directed by D W Griffith in 1912 is the first film to star Lilian and Dorothy Gish in what were termed at the time\"charming\" performances. It is a simple melodrama with threat and rescue but played nicely. Victoriuanism prevails. Note the use of the idea of the kiss and how Dorothy reacts to her first kiss in the final few fading frames.",
