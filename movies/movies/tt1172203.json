      "description": "Sita is a goddess separated from her beloved Lord and husband Rama. Nina is an animator whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the Indian epic Ramayana. Set to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw, Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as \"the Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told.\"",

      "description": "DVD VERSION! This is my own DVD version -- UN official, but loaded with goodies. You can find it as a direct-download here, but please if possible use the torrent and help seed! DVD features: High-quality video encoding; Director's Commentary featuring Nina Paley and Karl Fogel ; Subtitles including English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Dutch and Finnish; Customized chapter selection screens with screenshot previews - chapters are biased towards the Annette Hanshaw songs (for lack of anything better to base them on); Two trailers; Full-resolution anamorphic 16x9 video with 16x9 menus; A few fun easter-eggs. Please download, help seed, spread the word, and let me know what you think! 1080p/FLAC version: This is a remuxing of the 1080p .mp4 version of the movie as originally posted, combining the exact same video with the original uncompressed audio track in FLAC. That means that as of now, this is the highest possible quality version available. NOTICE: Please use the torrent if you can - it is webseeded by the uploaded version here yet will probably give you better download speeds. 720p AVCHD .iso: Please use the torrent ... This is burnable to one blank DVD, and should play on many blu-ray players including the Playstation 3. (check your player's documentation for the \"AVCHD\" logo; if it doesn't have it, bug the manufacturer to implement it in a firmware upgrade!) This .iso contains the original 720p video (non-transcoded) as well as original PCM audio. AVCHD is basically like a blu-ray quality disc but smaller, small enough to fit on a single-layer DVD blank. I've found that the disc is unrecognized in my computer's DVD drive after burning, but it plays in my Panasonic BD35k blu-ray player just beautifully, in full 720p HD.",
