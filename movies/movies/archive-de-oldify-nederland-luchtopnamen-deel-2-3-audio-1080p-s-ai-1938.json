      "description": "This is Part-2 of a highly interesting film that shows The Netherlands from the air more than 80 years ago in 1938. Currently I am trying to retrieve the description of the locations, but the new search engine in the Beeld En Geluid archives has made this almost an impossible task. If anyone recognizes certain locations then please include that in a comment. From a historic perspective this film has a lot too offer because a lot has changed since 1938, due to destruction during World War II and many new developments. The film contains spectacular footage of the city of Den Haag (The Hague) with its houses of parliament, the big church and the old city. Notes: Some flickering of the film is caused by the propellor; this can not be corrected with software. These fragments are in random order because there is no logic in the route that the plane seems to follow.
