      "description": "Ordered to take a vacation, US Marshal Cheyenne Davis (Lash Larue) and his sidekick Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) head for the Lobos ranch, but receive a chilly reception. After talking to saloon owner Fay Wilkins (Nancy Gates), Cheyenne suspects that an impostor has taken over the ranch. Written by Arthur E. Orloff Directed by Ray Taylor I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
