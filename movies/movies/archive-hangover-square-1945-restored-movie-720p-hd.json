      "description": "Hangover Square is a 1945 American horror film directed by John Brahm , based on the 1941 novel Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton . The screenplay was written by Barré Lyndon , who made a number of changes to the novel, including transforming George Harvey Bone into a classical composer-pianist and filming the story as a turn-of-the-20th-century period piece. The film, which stars Laird Cregar , Linda Darnell and George Sanders , was released in New York City on February 7, 1945, two months after Cregar suffered a fatal heart attack .",
