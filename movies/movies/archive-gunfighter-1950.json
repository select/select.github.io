      "description": "Notorious gunfighter Jimmy Ringo (Gregory Peck) has reformed and is on his way to a sleepy town in the hope of a reunion with his estranged sweetheart (Helen Westcott) and their young son (B.G. Morgan) whom he has never seen. But a showdown looms over the town as three vengeful cowboys are hot on his trail and a local gunslinger hopes to use Jimmy to make a name for himself. Gregory Peck as Jimmy Ringo Helen Westcott as Peggy Walsh Millard Mitchell as Marshal Mark Strett Jean Parker as Molly Karl Malden as Mac Skip Homeier as Hunt Bromley Anthony Ross as Deputy Charlie Norris Verna Felton as Mrs. August Pennyfeather Ellen Corby as Mrs. Devlin Richard Jaeckel as Eddie I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
