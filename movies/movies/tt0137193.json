      "description": "Stars: Black King, David Worth, June Marlowe\nDirector: Charles Hutchison\n\nSaddle up for a thrilling ride in this rare 1935 Classic Western, featuring the magnificent stallion Black King in a starring role alongside David Worth and June Marlowe. Directed by action veteran Charles Hutchison and produced by Black King Productions, this vintage Western delivers high-stakes drama, frontier justice, and a race against time.\n\nWhen the devious Don Carlos rigs a horse race and wins big, his luck quickly turns when he gambles away the fortune.

Only the loyalty of his friends—and the courage of the legendary horse Black King—can help him clear his name.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?
