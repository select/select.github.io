    "Plot": "How the Cowboy Makes His Lariat (1917)*** (out of 4) Wild West performer Pedro Leon is the highlight of this three-minute film that shows how cowboys make rope and various other items. Within the three-minutes we learn that horsehair is the best thing to use so we see a couple men, including Leon, put the hair together and from here we see how they get it prepared to use for rope and other items. There's really nothing ground-breaking that happens in this film but I must admit that it held my interest throughout and I found the entire subject to be rather interesting. At such a short running time there's nothing that we're going to learn in great detail but I still found it interesting seeing Leon put this rope together and work it. It's doubtful too many will be intrigued by this today but those wanting to see Leon in action should enjoy it.",
