      "description": "Brother and sister dancing duo Tom and Ellen Bowen (Fred Astaire and Jane Powell) travel to merry old England. There, against the backdrop of the impending wedding of royals, they go about the usual comedic pursuit of love. This film is probably most memorable for Astaire's dream sequence that has him dancing on the ceiling. The source is not of the best quality, with analog artifacts and blownout color. For more info on this film see its IMDB.com entry .",

      "description": "Title: Royal Wedding Summary: A brother and sister dance act encounter challenges and romance when booked in London during the Royal Wedding. Directed by: Stanley Donen Actors: Fred Astaire, Jane Powell, Peter Lawford Production Company: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Release Date: 23 March 1951 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 Tom and Ellen Bowen are a brother and sister dance act whose show closes in New York. Their agent books them in London for the same period as the Royal Wedding. They travel by ship where Ellen meets and becomes involved with Lord John Brindale. This causes her to miss a rehearsal. Tom (Astaire) uses the time to dance with a hat rack and gym equipment. Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Anne. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are in-the-clouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way, there is a vaudeville-style dance number in their show that features slapstick. It's a hoot.",
