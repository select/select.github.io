    "Plot": "Molly is seen in two shot sketches; first she's a glamourous star being interviewed in her dressing room. She unusually made up to be sexy in nearly see through pyjamas. She tells, alternating between a french accent and her normal, clear accent free American voice, about how she shot her husband. ( a popular subject of gags in the late 1920s.) The second part shows her as her in her well known persona of the haggard, put upon inner city woman, speaking in Yiddish dialect, relating to her Irish neighbor how her good for nothing husband mistreats her, yet she can't stop loving him.",
