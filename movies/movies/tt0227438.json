      "description": "The Doctor and the Monkey (1900) 'Le Savant et le Chimpanzé' Director: Georges Méliès The Doctor and the Monkey (French: Le Savant et le Chimpanzé) is a 1900 French short silent comedy film directed by Georges Méliès. Plot: In a two-story home (the cross section design of the set allows the viewer to see both levels), a doctor is studying a caged monkey. When the doctor leaves for a moment, the monkey escapes from the cage and begins wreaking havoc on both floors. The monkey's tail detaches and takes on a life of its own, attaching itself to the doctor's nose. Both the doctor and a housekeeper run about attempting to restore order, but the monkey continues to overturn furniture, and tears off the housekeeper's skirt, leaving her in her pantalettes. As the short film ends, the whole house is in shambles. Production and release: Méliès himself plays the doctor. The double-decker set was reused later the same year in What Is Home Without the Boarder, in which Méliès plays one of the tenants. The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 317 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a scène comique.",
