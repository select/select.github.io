      "description": "A German \"report\" film, this time about Housewives. There were also report films done about husbands and most famously schoolgirls. This one passes on the \"man in the street\" interviews and just sticks to vignettes of various housewives finding entertainment while their husbands work. Sadly I could not find subtitles, though I think that does little to detract from the viewing experience.  Rosi Mayr is in the film of course. She was in nearly all of the German sex comedies. Rosi started her film career at about 54 years of age and would go on to play bit parts in 131 movies but was a singer and stage actor before that.  German language",
