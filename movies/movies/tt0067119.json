      "description": "“The acting is what is frightening” (IMBD review quote). A mediocre cast that includes many non-professionals in an absurd screenplay meant to cash in on the ‘50s reincarnation craze. (Remember Bridey Murphy?) It’s stitched together by lackluster, static direction. On the plus side some of the NYC location cinematography is pretty good. If it wasn’t so tedious it might have been so-bad-it’s-good fun. IMDB rating 5.0. Produced and directed by W Lee Wider. Released in 1956. Complete print. AKA “Spell of the Hypnotist”",
