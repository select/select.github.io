      "description": "Meiko Kaji returns in Toshiya Fujita’s invigorating sequel to his own cult hit  Lady Snowblood.  Our furious heroine is captured by the authorities and sentenced to death for the various killings she has committed; however, she is offered a chance of escape—if she carries out dangerous orders for the government. More politically minded than the original,  Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance  is full of exciting plot turns and ingenious action sequences.",
