      "description": "Based on a true story, a monster invades Columbia. As Featured on Elvira's Movie Macabre http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079573/ The file marked \"VHSRip\" is from a tape in my personal collection which I thought was taped from Tv... until they started dropping \"F-Bombs\"... so I'm not sure where I got that. The 700mb file is from a tape a friend of mine had that he bought recently because I told him I liked the movie. The 700mb file is better quality and resolution.",
