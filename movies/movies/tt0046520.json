      "description": "It's FRIDAY @PizzaFLIX \nScore by: Tony Mottola\nStarring: Wim Holland. Lili Dawn, Vicki Carlson\n\nA series of bizarre crimes have New York City detectives on edge in this lurid thriller from first-and-only-time director Walter Strate. Famed Jazz guitarist Tony Mottola gets top billing for his flamenco meets burlesque score. Future grindhouse producer William P. Mishkin received his first movie credit for his highly original screenplay. And the gritty streets of New York provide a slice of the Big Apple circa 1953. If you prefer your PizzaFLIX on the seedy side, this one might be for you.",
