      "description": "This is a very high quality film that shows Austria's capital Vienna (Wien) just after World War II. It consists of raw footage, probably made for a post-war American movie. Similar to Berlin, Wien was also divided into four zones that were each controlled by the allied forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France. This occupation lasted from 1945 to 1955 after which Austria regained self-control. A great Hollywood movie that clearly depicts the situation in Wien during the post-war occupation is \"The Third Man\", written by Graham Green and with the highly memorable music by Anton Karas played on his zither. The title song was named \"The Harry Lime theme\" after the name of the main character in the movie. We would have loved to have added it to this film, were it not copyrighted. You can listen to it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEsWi88Qv0 and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ZWcwy12lk The film shows interesting parts of the city like the head quarters of the allied forces, Vienna's many old trams and a damaged part of the city and with a cathedral Please help to identify the locations in the timeline!
