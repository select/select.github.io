      "description": "In the summers of 1928 and 1929 two wealthy American families visited Paris, France. In this film we try to depict the sharp contrasts between their rich lives and those living on the streets of Paris, the so called clochards. The film begins and ends with the luxurious ocean crossings on respectively the SS Rotterdam and the SS Bremen. It shows splendid scenes of every day life of both the rich and the poor in Paris in high quality and contains a number of very rare glimpses, like the marvelous Trocadéro Palace close to the Eiffel Tower that was sadly demolished shortly after in 1937. The film ends with very rare footage of a seaplane being catapulted off the decks of the SS Bremen. Please now enjoy the rest of the film without further commentary. For the part that shows the Clochards in Paris we have used a new colorizer! On the one hand the colorization results are much better than with our regular colorizer, but it has a nasty habit of adding bright, unstable red tones to some objects which need to be reduced with the video editor (a lot of extra work). By the way, this part of the video is from 1910. More information about the Heinkel HE-12, Reg.No. D-1717, that is seen here being catapulted from the SS Bremen, can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_HE_12 The aircraft was damaged beyond repair in an accident at Cobequid Bay on 5 October 1931. The two crew members died.
