      "description": "\"Buzzard of Mars\" \"Possibly the most pointless movie ever made\" \"No doubt the worst Mars movie\" \"Horse of a different color\" \"Morons mess up Mars\" (IMDB reviews quotes). Sixties schlock fi with actors so bad they would have given Ed Wood pause. It's almost saved by John Carradine's disembodied head, but he just makes it funnier for all the wrong reasons. Some of the audio FX were ripped off from \"Forbidden Planet.\" Filmed in the Great Basin National Park, Nevada. IMDB rating 3.4. Directed by David L Hewitt. Released in 1964. Re-released in 1965 Complete print. a.k.a. \"The Wizard of Mars,\" \"Alien Massacre\" &\"Journey into the Unknown\".",
