    "Plot": "Elaine Hammerstein, part of the great theatrical family of producers and lyricists was a leading star on Broadway and -- in this period -- a leading actress in the films. Here in this backstage musical melodrama, she's a spunky New York Irish girl who makes her way up to star in a Broadway musical, but of course, she loves fellow New York Irish Teddy von Eltz. It's a full-dress melodrama co-written by Mrs. Fanny Hatton -- and, despite a few nice touches by director -- later MGM producer -- Hunt Stromberg, it doesn't work. It's hard to do musical numbers in silent pictures, although some people could manage -- Robert Z. Leonard could manage and von Stroheim's MERRY WIDOW works beautifully.However, the musical numbers, which should be set-pieces of beauty to contrast with the tawdriness of the rest of the melodrama, don't really come off. Miss Hammerstein looks best posing in the intermediate two-shots -- she is very charming but doesn't seem to know how to play to the camera, and the story line is fairly standard. Even the Demille-type party scene looks a little tired.While this is by no means a bad movie, it lacks anything to make it great. Worth a look. but missing it won't ruin your life.",
