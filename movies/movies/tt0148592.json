    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie are deepsea fishing on their trawler when they find a map leading to a sunken treasure ship. Scrappy puts on his diving helmet and finds the chest containing treasure, but an obnoxious octopus gets in his way.It's an attempted return to form for Scrappy, whose had started out under Dick Huemer as a boy who lived in a fantasy world without adults. After Huemer left, the character went through a couple of redesigns that made the series less weird, but this late cartoon, with its Termite-Terrace inspired confrontation, offers a bit of the old magic.",
