    "Plot": "A lot of work and talent went into this episode in the 'Scrappy' series of cartoons, but I get little pleasure out of it, because it is clearly aimed at small children, with very little, except some technical work, of interest to an adult. The animation is fluid and cartoonish as Scrappy and Oopie train for and fight against a well-drawn Max Baer, a leading and feared boxer of the day who killed at least one man in the ring.There are a couple of good gags in the opening sequence as the two children train: a shadow boxing gag and beating up one of those sand-bottomed boxing figures that were still popular in the 1960s. And certainly the set-up and logic would appeal to a small child. However, it never really cuts loose with its assumptions as the cartoonists over at Leon Schlesinger's, the Fleischer's and Disney studios did. It remains, therefore, a minor effort.",
