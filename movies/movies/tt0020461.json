Yeah it’s a creaker but an entertaining creaker with some cast members who would go on to long and distinguished Hollywood careers. The video quality is fair. The audio is primitive yet intelligible. IMDB rating 5.9. Directed by Frank Tuttle. Released in 1929. Complete print. CAST NOTE: Fredrick March and Florence Eldridge were off-screen husband and wife.",
