    "Plot": "The camera is high above Manhattan near the top of the Times Building, pointing down. We see the edge of the parapet where the camera operator stands. The shot pans up, revealing first a four-story building next to the Times, then taller buildings in the neighborhood, and slowly an island full. We look across Manhattan, a bridge in the distance. Then a second shot starts at Bryant Square beneath, and pans from right to left, we see the hippodrome, buildings filling every block, the Hotel Gerald, water towers atop low buildings, a large church, and then the intersection of Broadway and Seventh - Times Square.",
