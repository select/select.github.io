      "description": "A young woman is tricked into attending a ritual that lets her dead father possess her.  Once again Paul Naschy in a movie with a pretty significant amount of nudity. But, surprise, he does not bed anyone in this film. The Italian studios were pumping out movies at this point, Paul was in eight of them in 1975 and they tended to be very workman-like. This Exorcist ripoff has Paul as the priest but the possessed girl is played by Mercedes Molina who was a bit older than Linda Blair was when she starred in The Exorcist.  Good quality image with the full length noted on IMDb",
