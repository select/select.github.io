      "description": "This is a complete version of “Nightmare Castle,” (“Amanti d'Oltretomba”) running 1:44; other versions in the Archive are the US edit, at 1:19. According to imdb.com, “Cut scenes are mainly plot to increase the tempo, as well as some scenes with violence.” This print is considerably sharper, and with better contrast, than the others, as well. Although the opening and closing credits are in Italian, all dialogue is in dubbed English. I’ve included an Italian movie poster, which misspells the star’s surname as “Steel,” just as in the movie’s credits.",
