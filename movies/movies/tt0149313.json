      "description": "Farmer Al Falfa and his dog try to have a private picnic, but Heckle & Jeckle decide to freeload. The usual hijinks ensue as the farmer and his dog try to get rid of the magpies. Eventually, the farmer gives them a stick of dynamite disguised as a hot dog. As they try to roast it, the farmer drives away in his car to avoid the explosion, but Heckle & Jeckle throw the dynamite into their car.

    "Plot": "People will have their own opinion of which is the best of Terrytoons' numerous theatrical series. Some may say the most prolific one Mighty Mouse, introduced in 1942 with 'The Mouse of Tomorrow' all the way through to 1961 with 'Cat Alarm' and second to Farmer Al Falfa (not a Terrytoons creation though) as the studio's longest running character. Some may say the Gandy and Sourpuss series, despite getting tired and having its misfires that is a stronger contender as some of their cartoons are among the studio's best efforts.1946 introduced Heckle and Jeckle in this cartoon 'The Uninvited Pests' (their first \"official\" cartoon), the magpies that can easily be mistaken for them in 'The Talking Magpies' (another one of the studio's best) being prototypes. Their series was one of Terrytoons' most popular, and lasted for 20 years until their last 1966's 'Dressed Up Movie Makers'. From personal view, they are generally more compelling characters than Mighty Mouse and Gandy/Sourpuss and their series is my vote for Terrytoons' best, their best cartoons being Terrytoons high points. One of those high points is 'The Uninvited Pests'.Have nothing to fault the animation for, starting off what 'The Uninvited Pests' does well. Vibrant colours, nice attention to detail, far from static or simplistic backgrounds, the drawing is so much smoother than when the studio first started and the transitions are much more fluid and less choppy, nowhere near as much recycling or cutting corners either. The music never disappointed with Terrytoons, always the best asset of their worst efforts and it is one of the best things here still. It is so lovely to listen to and there is such an uplifting vibe hearing it because of the snappy character it has.When it comes to the gags, 'The Uninvited Pests' is one of the highest gag counts for any Terrytoons cartoon up to this point and perhaps of their entire output. The cartoon is filled with them and they all range from amusing to hilarious. Likewise with the dialogue. The pace is fast and furious and the action and increasing anarchy is wonderfully chaotic, yet remarkably it doesn't feel too much of an overload. The story is not novel, but the character interaction, constant entertainment value and eventful content helped always make it interesting. Heckle and Jeckle are highly entertaining characters, their movements, the way they talk (in the use of language and the voices themselves) and their expressions make them quite unique characters for Terrytoons. Dimwit the dog, aptly named oddly enough, is a nice contrast.Really can find little wrong here in the 'The Uninvited Pests'. The ending is not much of a surprise at all.Farmer Al Falfa always left me a bit mixed when appearing in colour cartoons. He is not an annoying character, he works well with Heckle and Jeckle and he has personality. Like what was said for his other in-colour appearences, for me he doesn't really transition well into colour and his character design is pretty primitive.Otherwise, this was very strong stuff and a Terrytoons high point. As far as the studio's 1946 output goes, it is definitely in the top 3. 8/10",
