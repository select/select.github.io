      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Border Romance is an early sound western romance comedy. If that seems like a lot of adjectives, that is because this short feature tried to pack a lot into fifty eight minutes. Unfortunately, besides the many genres, this film has mostly been forgotten, with little to remember other than serving as a starring role for lead actress Armida.",
