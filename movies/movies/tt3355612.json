      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This partially lost picture is based on a segment of Journey to the West.  It follows a monk who is lured by spider women in an attempt to tempt him into marrying one of them. The entirety of the film was thought lost until 2011 when a majority of it was found in a Norwegian archive. This version has both the original Chinese, the Norwegian translation, and English translations of both.
