Plot: Sherlock Holmes (Arthur Wontner) and Dr. Watson (Ian Fleming) come out of retirement to investigate a mysterious murder. They find that a group of coalminers, called The Scowlers, are caught up in the mystery, along with the treacherous Professor Moriarty (Lyn Harding). Holmes must outsmart Moriarity and an American gangster in order to find the murderers and save The Scowlers.",
