      "description": "The chief engineer (Howard Duff) on a project to send the first artificial satellite into high orbit is concerned that his wife (Cecile Chevreau) is having an affair with another member of the team (Andrew Osborn). After the failure of the rocket's final stage and the simultaneous disappearance of the couple, he is accused by the head of security (Alan Wheatley) of murdering them, stuffing their bodies into the rocket and sabotaging the fuel so as to leave the rocket with their remains circling the earth in a low orbit which will eventually cause it to burn up. Another scientist (Eva Bartok) tries to help him prove his innocence. Howard Duff as Dr. Stephen Mitchell Eva Bartok as Dr. Lisa Frank Alan Wheatley as Dr. Smith Philip Leaver as Professor Koepler Michael Medwin as Dr. Toby Andrews Andrew Osborn as Dr. Philip Crenshaw Cecile Chevreau as Vanessa Mitchell I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
