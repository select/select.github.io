      "description": "Commissioned by Mexican politician Castro (Pedro Armendariz), gunfighter Martin Brady (Mitchum) is tasked with smuggling weapons from Texas across the border to the south. He breaks his leg and recuperates in the arms of the seductive officer's wife, Ellen. When he botches his job, Castro sets a killer on him. Mitchum (who also produced the film) is in his element here, playing the border crosser, the man between worlds, with stoic composure. Director Robert Parrish , who also shot \"Playing with Fire\" (1957) with Mitchum, does a fine job. And Floyd Crosby's cinematography delivers beautiful, wildly romantic Technicolor images.",
