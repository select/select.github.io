      "description": "Hello and welcome back for another trip down memory lane with more big screen thrills and chills fueled by stale popcorn and flat soda. Tonight, in honor of our 100th presentation, we are pulling out all the mad scientist stops with a vintage triple feature of the King - Boris Karloff. First up, after a few coming attractions to put you in the mood as well as a \"Boogie\" cartoon, we bring you \"The Man Who Changed His Mind\". This 1936 movie stars Boris as a scientist who insists on swapping people's minds in order to help his career. Then, following a brief intermission, our screen is lit up by 1940's \"The Ape\", a Monogram offering with Karloff as a doctor helping a crippled girl walk through rather nefarious means. Finally, after yet another intermission, we end our celebration with 1936's \"Juggernaut\" featuring our star as another crazed scientist, this time resorting to murder to help fund his experiments. (NOTE: there is nothing wrong with your speaker. The sound is a bit \"staticky\" for our last film.) So, lean back and enjoy some crazed Karloff fun, and don't forget to visit our Snack Bar and Exit for a bit more fun.
