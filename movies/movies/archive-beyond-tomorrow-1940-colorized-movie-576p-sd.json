      "description": "Beyond Tomorrow (also known as And So Goodbye and Beyond Christmas ) is a 1940 American fantasy film directed by A. Edward Sutherland and produced by noted cinematographer Lee Garmes ; Garmes was one of a handful of cinematographers who became film producers. Structured as a B film , the production did not engage any stars who would receive billing above the title, relying instead on a quartet of veteran character actors, Charles Winninger , Maria Ouspenskaya , C. Aubrey Smith and Harry Carey , second-tier young leads Richard Carlson and Jean Parker as well as \"other woman\" Helen Vinson , a minor lead/second lead actress during the early- and mid-1930s, here approaching the end of her career. All seven actors received a \"Featuring\" billing after the title. The remaining supporting cast included Rod La Rocque , a top leading man of the silent era, now reduced to playing minor supporting roles. Because the events of the plot take place during the Christmas season, it is a contemporary, but little-remembered example of the Christmas film . The original print has been digitally remastered and preserved by the National Film Museum, Incorporated.",
