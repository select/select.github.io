    "Plot": "Vaudevillians Al Shaw and Sam Lee take to the stage in identical ill-fitting suits with bowlers and bow ties. Standing shoulder to shoulder facing the camera, they begin and end with comic songs; between the songs is a string of jokes and quips. The first song is a parody of \"In the merry, merry month of May\" and the concluding song is a song about a song. At the end, they throw in a bit of tap dancing. The camera doesn't move.",
