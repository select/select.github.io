      "description": "This short film gives an impression of the hard life of the fishermen and their families in Scheveningen nearly a century ago. Among other, the old harbour, repairing the fishing nets and sorting plus selling the fish come into view. Scheveningen is a village on the West coast of The Netherlands and borders the Dutch govenmental residency of The Hague. In the summer it is a seaside resort and offers many touristic attractions, like the Pier, Kuhrhaus, old harbour and beautiful yellow-sandy beaches. The original film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, A.I. enhanced and A.I. colorized. The lovely music is by Trevor Kowalski, titled \"Evening Imagery\"",
