      "description": "Reformed thief Boston Blackie is accused of murdering a man at an art auction, which leads to the uncovering of an art racket. #2 of 14 \"Boston Blackie\" films released between 1941 and 1949. Chester Morris as Horatio \"Boston Blackie\" Black Harriet Nelson as Diane Parrish Richard Lane as Inspector Farraday George E. Stone as The Runt Lloyd Corrigan as Arthur Manleder Joan Woodbury as Mona Walter Sande as Detective Mathews Ralph Theodore as Buchanan Kenneth MacDonald as Caulder I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
