    "Plot": "Well, it's black and white in this synchronized early Terrytoon. Also, it's monkeys and apes and the occasional leopard and elephant, but it's all pretty good.Paul Terry's staff still had not gotten the hang of doing actual speech -- only Harman and Ising really had that nailed at this point. However, the first half of this cartoon is excellent, with the well-composed gags being mostly about how the animals produce the music. The second half wanders a bit afar as the motif shifts to \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" for no clear reason except that all the gags are about characters riding bubbles. As happened so often, there wasn't enough material for a full cartoon. Still, the overall effect is good.",
