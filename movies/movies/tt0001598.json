The hero of this Biograph story gives way under the pressure of bad fortune, instead of fighting against it. His sweetheart, disappointed in him, turns him aside. Down the hill he goes until he is finally a singer in a low dance hall. Here he meets a young woman, who, through the want of strength of willpower, has gone about the same downward road as he. She, however, realizes that it is impossible for her to turn back; 'tis the way of the world, but for him, but for him, yes. He gets a chance if he will marry and settle down on a farm, and while he is willing he hasn't even the money to get him the place. The girl, unknown to him, helps him to take advantage of the offer. He goes to seek his former sweetheart, only to find himself forgotten, so he reasons that as it was the dance hall girl's persuasion that influenced him to brace up. He, of course, still ignorant of the extent of her aid; she would be the one with whom to begin the new life.",
