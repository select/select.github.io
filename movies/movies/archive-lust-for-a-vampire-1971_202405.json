      "description": "Lust for a Vampire , also known as  Love for a Vampire  or  To Love a Vampire  (the latter title was the one used on American television), is a 1971 British  Hammer Horror  film directed by  Jimmy Sangster , starring  Ralph Bates ,  Barbara Jefford ,  Suzanna Leigh , Michael Johnson, and  Yutte Stensgaard . It was given an  R  rating in the United States for some violence, gore, strong adult content and nudity. It is the second film in  the Karnstein Trilogy , loosely based on the 1872  Sheridan Le Fanu  novella  Carmilla . It was preceded by  The Vampire Lovers  (1970) and followed by  Twins of Evil  (1971). The three films do not form a chronological development, but use the Karnstein family as the source of the vampiric threat and were somewhat daring for the time in explicitly depicting  lesbian themes .",
