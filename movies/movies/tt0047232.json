      "description": "The Miami Story is a 1954 American film noir crime film directed by Fred F. Sears and starring Barry Sullivan, Luther Adler, John Baer, Adele Jergens.   It was the last of a number of classic-period noir crime dramas – the first being The House on 92nd Street (1945) – which now are known as ‘semi-documentaries’. These were characterised by a voice-over describing what we were seeing as we went along. It was a device meant to impart special impact to stories in praise of the forces of authority in their fearless struggle against enemies of society and the state, from communists to mobsters. Others include Call Northside 777 (1948), Walk a Crooked Mile (1948) and Walk East on Beacon (1952).
