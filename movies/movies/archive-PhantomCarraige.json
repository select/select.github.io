      "description": "The Phantom Carriage (Swedish: KÃ¶rkarlen) is a 1921 Swedish romantic horror film, generally considered to be one of the central works in the history of Swedish cinema. Released on New Year's Day, it was directed by and starred Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m, alongside Hilda BorgstrÃ¶m, Tore Svennberg and Astrid Holm.[1] It is based on the novel Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness! (KÃ¶rkarlen; 1912), by Nobel-prize winning Swedish author Selma LagerlÃ¶f. The film is notable for its special effects, its advanced (for the time) narrative structure with flashbacks within flashbacks, and for having been a major influence on Ingmar Bergman.[2]",
