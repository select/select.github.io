      "description": "Here is another drive-in sci fi catastrophy that by comparison makes Ed Wood look like Cecil B DeMille. In case you're interested (and I can't imagine why you would be) it's about alien monsters that devour lots of people head first, most of them girls in miniskirts. The colossal ineptness exhibited in every aspect of this production is breathtaking. Directed by Vic Savage (as A J Nelson) Released in 1964 a.k.a. \"The Crawling Monster\" Complete print with marginal video quality",
