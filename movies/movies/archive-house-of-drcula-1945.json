      "description": "Dracula arrives at Dr. Edelman's office asking for a cure to his vampirism, but this is a ruse by Dracula to get near Dr. Edelman's beautiful female assistant and turn her into a vampire. Meanwhile, a sincere Lawrence Talbot, AKA the Wolfman, arrives seeking a cure for his lycanthropy. When Dr. Edelman's first attempt fails, Talbot tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but instead finds a network of underground caves where Frankenstein's Monster is in stasis. Chaos ensues as the three monsters fight for dominance of one another.",
