      "description": "“Wartime action, drama, comedy and romance” “A bit less than routine” “Complete twaddle” (IMDB reviews quotes). A far-fetched and haphazard espionage thriller that implied the Germans were so gullible and incompetent they would be easy to defeat. Even as a home front morale booster it must have been hard to swallow in bomb-ravaged London and Coventry. Good cast and production. IMDB rating 5.4. Directed by Harold French. Released in 1942 (UK only). Complete print (PAL transfer). A.K.A. “Secret Service”",
