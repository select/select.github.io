    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie sneak a cat into a dog show and later enter a Saint Bernard in this fine Sid Marcus entry in the series.The Scrappy cartoons were often more bizarre than funny and in this one, the strangely slow timing of the second sequence makes it both bizarre and funny. The character design of the humans suggests they are caricatures of celebrities of the period, although I can't identify any of them.Even though the Marcus Scrappies were no where near as good as the earlier ones directed by Dick Huemer, this one is good throughout. The erratic nature of the series and its general unavailability may have resulted in a lack of interest, but this one may help turn that around.",
