      "description": "My documentary shows Titanic while it was being built at the Harland & Wolff shipyard at Belfast and the sad events after this beautiful ship hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sunk on 15 april 1912. We have used our film restoration skills to best ability to show what happened after this terrible disaster in full color. The many film fragments have been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, meticulously enhanced and colorized by means of state-of-the art Artificial Intelligence software. The film starts with the only existing footage of RMS Titanic while it still was being finalized at the Harland and Wolfe shipyard in Belfast. Many people still try to claim that this was not the Titanic but her sister ship RMS Olympic because of the clearly visible open structure of the \"A\" deck, also know as the Promenade deck. However, history experts have confirmed that this film was probably shot around 15 February 1912. In the following weeks most of the A-deck was closed-in except about one third of the ship's length from the bow. What many people don't seem to know is that the Titanic left Belfast on the 10th of Apil 1912 from where it sailed to Southampton. During four days it remained in port at Southampon before taking on the passengers for its first Atlantic Ocean crossing to New York in America. On its way to New York it made an intermediate stop at Cherbourg in France, which is another lesser known fact. The story of the Titanic hitting the iceberg is well-known and therefore will not be elaborated further in this description. The film goes on to show the Carpathia on its return from the disaster site with the survivors back to New York, including a glimpse of its captain Rostron. There is also a scene showing Father Browne who was the first to spot the life boats in the water when the Carpathia came to the rescue. You will view an extremely rare scene of the tragedy being announced in English newspapers including paperboys scrambling to get a hold of a stack of news papers to sell. Also a church service in London is part of the footage. Furthermore, we see Guilliermo Marconi and his wife in New York shortly after Titanic sank. Marconi was the inventor of radio communication which helped to save many lives because the Carpathia picked up Titanic's distress signals. The film ends with sad scenes of the Mackay Bennett that sailed to the location four days after to recover the remaining bodies from the sea. Music: Trevor Kowalski and others Timeline: 00:00 The only original footage of RMS Titanic at Harland & Wolfe shipyard in Belfast. 00:15 This footage was shot around 15 February 1912 00:30 So this does NOT portray Titanic leaving on its fatal maiden voyage. 00:45 It probably was one of her first test trials 01:58 Look carefully: you can just about read \"Titanic\" under the 4th porthole below the deck! 02:05 The Promenade (\"A\") deck is still open.
