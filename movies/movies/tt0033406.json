      "description": "The Blood of Jesus ( 1941 ) is a classic example of the \" race film \" genre of films by African-American directors and casts, geared exclusively for an African-American audience. This film, written and directed by Spencer William Jr. of the TV show Amos & Andy Show (who also played Razz Williams in the film), is a morality tale about a woman ( Cathryn Caviness ) who is accidentally shot to death by her husband. Facing death, she must choose between Hell , represented as urban life, and Zion , represented as pastoral America, and between Satan and God . The climax comes when she makes her decision at the foot of the cross and wakes up to singing of her church choir. Intended to promote a Black Southern Baptist ideal of a virtuous rural life, the film was a major success and the most popular hit in its genre. See Also, IMDB Entry The film has also been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry .
