      "description": "Edge of the City is a 1957 American  film-noir   drama film  directed by  Martin Ritt  in his  directorial debut , and starring  John Cassavetes  and  Sidney Poitier .  Robert Alan Aurthur 's screenplay was expanded from his original script, staged as the final episode of  Philco Television Playhouse , A Man Is Ten Feet Tall (1955), also featuring Poitier. The film was considered unusual for its time because of its portrayal of an interracial friendship, and was praised by representatives of the  NAACP ,  Urban League ,  American Jewish Committee  and Interfaith Council because of its portrayal of racial brotherhood. In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"",
