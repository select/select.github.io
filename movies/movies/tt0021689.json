    "Plot": "Bosko's phone is ringing, very insistently, with help from the alarm clock. Finally, they get Bosko out of bed; it's his girlfriend, suggesting a picnic. He drives over to her place. They are pursued by a pesky little dog, who chomps on one of the tires and fills with air, but Bosko uses cartoon repair techniques to get the car going again. Bosko eats a sandwich, very loudly, but his girl has other plans.",
