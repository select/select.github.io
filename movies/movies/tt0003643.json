      "description": "The Avenging Conscience was directed by D.W. Griffith in 1914. It is 50 minutes long, a step in Griffith's progressive move into feature films. His next film was to me his controversial masterpiece, Birth of a Nation. This film is based on writings of Edgar Allen Poe, it is Victorian and sentimental but it is also quite visual. Rather than be a spoiler I will let the story tell itself. I have added music and sound effects, and I may have gone a bit overboard myself as you will see if you watch it. As for the black rectangle at the bottom of the screen, someone had acquired this definitely public domain film and added their own trademark to the print. I covered this over. I hope that disrespect for a piece of film history does not annoy you as much as it annoyed me.",
