Directed by: Robert Parrish Actors: Dick Powell, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Erdman Production Company: Olympic Productions Inc. Release Date: 23 February 1951 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 Rocky Mulloy, back in town after serving 5 years of a life sentence for armed robbery, hopes to clear his friend Danny Morgan who's still in prison for the same crime. It won't be easy. Even the witness who cleared Rocky thinks he's guilty; Danny's glamorous wife Nancy, living in a sleazy trailer court, seems lukewarm about getting Danny back; cynical cop Gus Cobb just wants to stir things up in hopes that the missing \"hot\" $100,000 will surface. Plenty of tough talk, night scenes, deceptive dames and double crosses in this typical film noir.",
