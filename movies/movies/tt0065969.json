      "description": "The Last Valley is a 1971 film written and directed by James Clavell, an historical drama  set during the Thirty Years' War and follows a mercenary captain, played by Michael Caine, who leads his men in pillaging the countryside. They encounter a former teacher, Vogel (Omar Sharif), who discovers a peaceful valley untouched by war and persuades the captain to spare it, leading to a complex interplay of survival, morality, and the consequences of war. Based upon the novel The Last Valley, by J. B. Pick, the cinematic version of The Last Valley was the final feature film photographed with the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process until it was revived to make the film Baraka in 1991.",
