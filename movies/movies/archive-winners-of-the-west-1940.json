      "description": "King Carter doesn't want the railroad to go through his territory, so he induces the local Indians into attacking the railroad crew. The head of the crew is Jeff Ramsay (Dick Foran) and he and his sidekick Tex Houston (Tom Fadden) must repeatedly foil Carter's attempts at sabotaging the surveyors, supply trains, stagecoaches, bridges, telegraph lines, and the railroad president's daughter (Anne Nagel). Dick Foran as Jeff Ramsay Anne Nagel as Claire Hartford Tom Fadden as Tex Houston James Craig as Jim Jackson Harry Woods as King Carter Charles Stevens as Snakeye Edward Keane as John Hartford Trevor Bardette as Raven Roy Barcroft as Logan, henchman I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
