      "description": "U. S. Customs Agent Tom Evans (Charles Quigley) goes undercover as a trucker to track down a smuggling ring which hijacks Canadian fur-shipper's trucks and sells the loot in the United States. Featuring a young Rits Hayworth as Patricia Lane. Written by Edgar Edwards Directed by Leon Barsha I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
