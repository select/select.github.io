      "description": "From Wikipedia: \"This film was taken in Italy on April 24, 1909. It is the first time a motion picture was ever shot from a plane in flight. The footage shows what it was like to fly on one of the early Wright craft, with Wilbur at the helm. The clip opens with the launching, then the plane climbs, levels off, and passes over the flight grounds.\"",
