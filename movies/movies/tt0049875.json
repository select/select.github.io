      "description": "The story of two artists, locked in a life-or-death sworn conflict, between whom a woman forces herself. Initially, she tries to outwit them out of ambition, but ultimately falls in love with one of them. A melodramatic circus film, with a rather conventional love triangle, is captivating and entertaining thanks to the solid performances and, above all, the outstanding acrobatic scenes.",
