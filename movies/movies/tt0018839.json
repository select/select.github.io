      "description": "Roughneck stoker Bill Roberts (George Bancroft) gets into all sorts of trouble during a brief shore leave when he falls hard for Mae (Betty Compson), a wise and weary dance-hall girl, in Josef von Sternberg’s evocative portrait of working-class waterfront folk. Fog-enshrouded cinematography by Harold Rosson ( The Wizard of Oz ), expressionist set design by Hans Dreier ( Sunset Boulevard ), and sensual performances by Bancroft and Compson make this one of the legendary director’s finest works, and one of the most exquisitely crafted films of the era.",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Josef von Sternberg's prohibition drama follows a coal stoker and the prostitute that he falls in love with. On release the box office was mediocre, though reviews were solid. Modern reviews have much more praise to give for the film, frequently labeling it as one of the final great silent films.",
