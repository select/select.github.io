      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Lowell Sherman directed and starred in this comedy about a princess who wishes to marry a commoner. Critics of the time appreciated it quite a bit, it was also a hit with audiences who made it a box office hit, though for modern audiences the memory of the film has been a bit easier to forget.  I'm uploading two versions here, one with a watermark in the upper right corner for the length of the film, and another with considerably worse quality of video and sound. ",
