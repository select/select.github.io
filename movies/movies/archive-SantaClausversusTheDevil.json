      "description": "A bizarre flick from Mexico translated by K. Gordon Murray for children's matinees, in which Santa Claus is the envy of the CIA and avoids child labor laws by keeping his slaves in an orbital castle over the North Pole. Currently #44 on IMDB's Bottom 100 of worst films, beating out \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" by a wide margin. From everything I've heard, it's PD in Mexico, too, so the GATT monster didn't get this one!",
