      "description": "Despite the warnings from her conscience, Molly drinks the same brew that got poor Rip Van Winkle drunk and made him sleep for 20 years. The bizarre bovine has a close encounter with little men, throws her own private keg party, bowls against her ghostly double and awakens the famous Washington Irving character just in time for the iris out. Just plain weird! Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/molly-moo-cow-and-rip-van-winkle-1935/",
