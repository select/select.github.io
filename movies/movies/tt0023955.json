      "description": "Country physician Dr. Bull (Will Rogers) is big on homespun wisdom and thinks little of newfangled medicine. He also spends much of his time wooing widow Janet Cardmaker (Vera Allen). But his attitude toward his job and his taste in women are making him the target of town gossips, and, when circumst ances beyond his control prevent him from saving a young girl, the locals turn on him. A typhoid case then breaks out, which could either help prove Doc's worth or cement his reputation as a quack.",
