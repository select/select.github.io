    "Plot": "Composed of archival material and exclusive footage, Sheldon Renan and Leonard Schrader's shocking and eye-opening documentary of carnage, madness, and mayhem focuses, with an unapologetic sincerity, on the factual depiction of violence in the industrialised nation of the United States. Featuring a juxtaposition of detailed accounts of terrible acts, brutal behaviour, and interviews from experts and convicted serial killers alike, this grim collection of pain doesn't shy away from real-life, in-your-face, horrifying imagery, and the escalating levels of crime and murder in the United States. The Killing of America also documents two shocking murders: the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which marks the beginning of a new era of violence, and the murder of John Lennon on the evening of December 8, 1980.",
