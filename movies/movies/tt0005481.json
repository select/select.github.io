    "Plot": "Sadly only the first 14 minutes of this film survive.  What we have is extraordinary and valuable footage of Australian World War 1 soldiers in training and leaving for overseas.  This footage is genuine.  Woven around it is a story of a soldier and his girl.  It's hard to know from the surviving footage where this story would go and how well it would be presented.  But there is some beautiful photography, a very moving scene where his family toasts his health the night before he leaves, and some nicely lit scenes where he reads his girl's letter on board ship as she reads his at home.The footage ends with some fascinating film shot in Egypt - oh why did we let such valuable footage disappear!?!",
