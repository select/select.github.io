    "Plot": "Margie wants to be a movie star, so she breaks into Scrappy's movie studio and auditions for Scrappy and Oopie, whether they want her too or not.It's not one of the best of the Scrappy cartoons, even for this lackluster period. Indeed, the introduction of new characters ino a series is always an indication of drift. Originally, Scrappy, Oopie, and the dog Yippee had made the whole regular cast of the series, which was carried on the weird, childlike fantasies of the cartoons. Now it was turning into an \"Our Gang\" sort of series, with, in this case, a movie studio concocted of the cast-offs of the world, a long-running bit in the Hal Roach series.",
