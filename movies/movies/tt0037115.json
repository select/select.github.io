      "description": "Fairly standard \"white heiress who was lost in the jungle as an infant, but turns out to be a goddess to local tribe of natives\" adventure. The white goddess in this case is the highly decorative Julie London, she's found by Buster Crabbe, and maintains her power via her control of an ape(suit), Nabonga. There is a bit of a twist on the standard story - instead of needing to find her to secure her fortune, her father was the crook, and Crabbe is looking to return some of the loot that he stole. Mostly lackluster. The MP4 and the Matroska (MKV) files were derived from the MPEG2 file found here . The Matroska is a Theora file with Vorbis sound, but Handbrake wouldn't let me put it in an OGG container for some reason.",

The sweaty safari begins with coming attractions and a cartoon, followed by the first feature, \"Nabonga,\" with Julie London. The intermission featurette is chapter 2 of the serial \"Perils of the Darkest Jungle\" (a.k.a. \"The Tiger Woman\") with Linda Sterling. The second feature presentation is \"Blonde Savage\" with Gale Sherwood and Veda Ann Borg. NOTE: The complete serial \"Perils of the Darkest Jungle,\" which is highly recommended for matinee serial fans, is available on DVD from the Roan Group. All the other items in this simulation are found in various IA collections.",
