    "Plot": "A flapper turns on her radio set to listen to a musical program. Sitting on top of the radio is the radio's external speaker. In a clever closeup we see Rudy Vallee himself stepping out of the speaker singing a hit song of the day, \"Honey\"! He joins his band, the Connecticut Yankees, all seemingly assembled on top of the radio in miniature size, and plays \"You're Just Another Memory\". Vallee dons a crumpled top hat in an imitation of another famous bandleader of the 1920's, Ted Lewis, during the last song \"You'll Do It Someday\". He plays an amusing Lewis style clarinet solo and even does a magic trick with the top hat before this short is over.",
