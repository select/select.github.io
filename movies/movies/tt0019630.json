      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Banned in Chicago the year it was released for \"immorality\", Alibi was nominated for three Academy Awards, and was thought of as the greatest gangster film yet made. Modern reviews are less glowing, but the picture still serves as an interesting Pre-code crime drama. ",
