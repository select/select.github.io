Santa is especially interested in helping Lupita, the daughter of a poor family, who wants nothing more than a doll; and a young boy whose parents are so wealthy they never spend any time with him (Santa fixes this by feeding them Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters). However, the Devil will have none of this and sends his minion Pitch to foil Santa's plans. Pitch in turn recruits three Naughty Boys to help him set traps for Santa.",
