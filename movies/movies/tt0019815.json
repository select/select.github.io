      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. A post Napoleonic-France set musical whose claim to fame was the sound debut of heartthrob Ramon Novarro, Devil-May-Care also had a technicolor dance sequence and was a box office hit. Reviews were fine, though it was important to prove that Novarro could lead a talkie picture.",

    "Plot": "Napoleon Bonaparte has just abdicated the throne of France and Italy and has been banished to Elba, in the process restoring Louis XVIII to the throne. In the battle between the Bonapartists and the Royalists, Louis has ordered the execution of Napoleon's loyal soldiers, including Armand de Treville. However, Armand is able to escape just before he is to be executed. He is eventually able to take refuge in the south of France at the chateau of his friend, the Countess Louise, who, despite being a Royalist, is Armand's friend first and foremost. He is to be incognito working as one of her servants. Although Louise is in love with Armand, he in turn sees her more as a sister. En route to Louise's, Armand meets another Royalist, Leonie de Beaufort, with who, in their short encounter, he falls in love, although she would not even recognize him if she saw him again if only because of his face being hidden in the darkness during their encounter. Unknown to Armand, Leonie and Louise are cousins. So when he discovers the relationship between Leonie and Louise when Leonie comes to visit Louise, Armand wants to try and make her fall in love with him, all while he is masquerading as a servant, and still work on the goal of restoring Napoleon to power. Meanwhile, news of the dangerous Armand de Treville's escape is spreading through the country, many Royalists who would or want to shoot to kill him on sight, including Leonie.",
