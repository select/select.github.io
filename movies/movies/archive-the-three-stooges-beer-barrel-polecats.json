      "description": "\"Beer Barrel Polecats\" (1946) Moe, Larry, and Curly pose as beer salesmen but accidentally get tangled up in a case of mistaken identity. Their antics lead to chaos when they are mistaken for fugitives by the police. As usual, slapstick mayhem ensues, with Curly’s antics and the trio’s bumbling causing hilariously disastrous results. Colorized and digitally enhanced as God intended.",
