      "description": "This print is sharper and with cleaner audio than the existing IA copy. All is not well on young Lord Lebanon's ancestral estate, what with his mother's constant nagging and the chauffeur turning up dead, in this Edgar Wallace mystery with a good cast and rising body count. (It's always amazed me our British friends were able to produce and release quality films like this during the most desperate days of the blitz.) Directed by George King UK release 1940 US release 1941 a.k.a. \"The Frightened Lady\" Complete print (US version) NOTE: Other recommended British films of the period which are available here at IA include \"49th Parallel,\" \"In Which We Serve,\" \"The Way Ahead\" and \"We Dive at Dawn.\"",
