    "Plot": "An evil spider lights a candle to trap a beautiful lady moth in this black-and-white Terrytoon. Can the horsefly-mounted insect cavalry save her? Most of the fun in this particular cartoon comes from the way the six-legged spider behaves. He is scruffy, wears his suspenders where everyone can see, shaves infrequently (to judge from his beard) and punishes himself for his failure to trap innocent insects. It's funny in a melted-lead and boiling-oil way. Although I like spiders, few people do. Some people are actively afraid of them and that hatred of harmless, useful spiders transferred to the spider itself is very amusing.",
