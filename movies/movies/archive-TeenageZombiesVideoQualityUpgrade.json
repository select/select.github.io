      "description": "This print is sharper with better contrast and a smaller download file than the existing IA copy. Entertainingly bad teen exploitation with a whacky screenplay, low production values and awful acting. A gorilla suit is the ketchup on the corndog. Produced and directed by Jerry Warren. Released in 1960. a.k.a. \"Teenage Torture\" (2nd release title). Complete print. TRIVIA: The title and background music were stolen from \"Kronos\" (1957) CAST NOTE: Don Sullivan (Regg) also has the leading role in \"The Giant Gila Monster,\" which is here at IA in the restored version of its original widescreen release.",
