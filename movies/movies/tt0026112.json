It seems he was killed over a substantial amount of cash he'd hidden somewhere in the house, but didn't get around to disclosing the whereabouts of. When his servant and then his sidekick (Lafe McKee) disappear, Tom sees a masked stranger leaving the ranch and chases him. But the stranger's men are waiting and Tom soon finds himself a prisoner.",
