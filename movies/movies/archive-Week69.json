      "description": "The \"dead\" of Winter continues on and we here at the haunted drive in thought that a warmer climate might be nice to visit this time of year. So, what better place than the land of pasta, olives, and the blue waters of the Mediterranean.  Of course, we return to Italy for two monster-pieces of celluloid calzone. After a fresh serving of coming attractions and a Universal \"jazz\" cartoon, we proudly present \"The Atom Age Vampire\" - an Italian love story about a scientist trying to save a stripper's beauty (yes there is no vampire, but we think you'll like the scenery).  Finally, after a brief intermission, we bring out everyone's favorite Italian horror-fest, \" Werewolf in a Girls' Dormitory\". Now, with a show like this, we dare you to go to the snack bar for a couple slices of pizza and some icy pops. http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://shockerdrivein.primehost24.tk",
