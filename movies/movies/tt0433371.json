His widow Dianne hopes to build a new life in California but gets stuck with car trouble in Texas. To pay for the repairs, she becomes waitress Dee Dee in a diner. There the swindler, who apparently doesn't recognize Diane, recruits 'Dee Dee' as investment sales pitch assistant. Friendly local sheriff Nando, who has a crush on her, promises to help catch the trickster under his new name, unofficially as he has no cause for legal action. But more is not what is seems.",
