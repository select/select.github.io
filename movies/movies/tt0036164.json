      "description": "WARNING: This is likely to be the worst WW2 espionage movie you will ever see. Why is explained in  my review which has been lifted from a place whose name is no longer mentioned in polite society: \"This isn't the Greatest Generation's World War II. It is an absurd, low-budget attempt at making a spy drama that instead became an unintentional parody. It features a commissar with a Brooklyn-Russian accent; elderly waiters tottering around with secret notes; downed allied flyers having a hilariously good time in German-occupied France; the most unlikely bunch of Nazis outside of \"The Producers\"(1968); and that's just for starters. The plot is juvenile nonsense about a female Russian spy (Lola Lane) smuggled into Paris to save Anglo-American convoys. Her foil is John Vosper, who's laughably awful as a ruthless Nazi colonel who appears more like Hogan's Heroes' Colonel Klink. Lola lane's performance isn't much better. In fact, the only convincing cast members are those without lines. Capped with a jaw-dropping final scene, some might call \"Miss V from Moscow\" so bad it's good. I won't go that far, but I do give it three stars because this bizarre klinker must be seen to be believed.\" Directed by Albert Herman Released in 1942 a.k.a. \"Intrigue in Paris\" Complete print",
