      "description": "Four highly interesting folkloric Clog dances from the Netherlands nearly a century ago in colour! Please note that the 3rd fragment is without sound. These are the four films: 1. Clog Dance in Volendam in 1928 2. Clog Dance in Deventer in 1939 3. Clog Dance in Friesland in 1923 (no sound) 4. Clog Dance in Germany as preparation to the Olympic Games in 1936. There is not much known about the first dance. The second dance was recorded after the arrival in Deventer of parade of dancers from the village of Olst. Some spectators are dressed in 17th century Dutch costume. One spectator is strapped in a socalled scandpost intended to make a mockery out of him as punishment for some kind of fellony. The third dance (without sound) was recorded \"en Fryske\". The fourth dance is part of a stage performance in KDF Stadt. KDF stands for \"Kraft Durch Freude\", a kind of pleasure resort to reward workers under the Nazi regime. KDF Stadt nowadays is Wolfsburg. These four films have been motion-stabilized, AI enhanced and AI colorized.",
