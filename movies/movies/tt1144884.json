      "description": "THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION is based on the remarkable true story of the life of Dan Eldon (Ben Schnetzer), a photographer, artist, and adventurer.  By the age of 22, he had traveled to more than 40 countries, created fine art journals, worked with refugees, been hired as the youngest photojournalist at Reuters, fallen in love  — and accumulated more life experience than most in a lifetime.  Witty and inspiring, the film tells the story of a young man coming of age to realize his purpose, and his belief that we can all create positive change.\n2016.
