    "Plot": "In \"Those Country Kids\", Fatty and Mabel (Fatty Arbuckle and Mabel Normand) are neighbors who are in love. However, Fatty's rival (Al St. John) is on hand to make things annoying and Fatty responds by tossing and shooting things at him with his slingshot. Oddly, he also shoots stuff at his prospective father-in-law....not a great way to impress him! In fact MUCH of this short features thsi sort of slapstick--violence foro the sake of comedy. Back in 1914, folks ate this mindless stuff up...today it just seems unfunny. And, for a comedy, unfunny is a killer.",
