    "Plot": "Julie Whitcomb and Paul Niles meet and fall in love on the ship returning them from Europe. But once in New York, where Julie owns a boutique, she tries to break off their romance, telling Paul she's married. At the same time, Julie's stepdaughter, Doris, plans a welcome home party for her brother, Victor, after his extended absence. He left in a huff when his father, John, planned to marry shortly after his mother died, and never met the intended bride. When Julie joins the party, both are shocked when they see each other. It seems that Victor changed his name to Paul Niles and Julie was known as Madame Julie, the name of her boutique, so they had no idea when they met they were stepmother and stepson. They continue their deception, but Doris guesses the truth when she catches Victor lying about the ship he came in on. She writes a letter to her father telling all, but Julie gets hold of the note. Victor has asked her to meet him at the pier for a ship going back to Europe, and now John tells her he bought her a villa on the Riviera where they can both retire to. Torn between both her loves, she first asks John to read the letter Doris wrote.",
