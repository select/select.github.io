      "description": "Self-service gas bars aren't a modern phenomenon, as evidenced by this visionary cartoon. The Auto Clinic is automated... everyone is treated alike by the three  gas pumps until a pretty customer comes along, then they all turn on the  charm... but when a cigar-smoking troublemaker comes along, they give him the  \"treatment.\" Krazy Kat protects his anthropomorphic service station from the  gangster. Lots of bizarre visuals in this one! Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/the-auto-clinic-1938/",
