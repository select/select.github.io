      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the existing IA copy, and it is in the correct aspect ratio. A telling spoof of instant celebrity culture and one of the thirties' great screwball comedies with a cast well suited to its wacky screenplay. Directed by William Wellman. Released in 1937. Complete print.",
