      "description": "CRISES YEAR =========== After the devastating Wallstreet crash in October 1929 not only the US economy went into turmoil but the negative effects of the Great Depression spread to all corners of the world. My country, The Netherlands, was one of the countries that did not escape from this fate. Unemployement started to rise dramically. All ready in 1930 about 150.000 men, out of a population of just over 7 million had become unemployed. In the following years unemployent rose steeply to its peak level of 600.000 by 1935. Gradually it then started to slightly decrease although until the second world war about 350.000 remained unemployed. The period of between 1934 and 1936 was thus named the \"Crises years\" in The Netherlands. Daily rows of unemployed men would kew up in front of labour exchange bureaus, either to try to find very scarce jobs of to receive a stamp in their booklet to confirm their status of unemployment in order to receive dole money. In order to avoid people becoming too lazy too work, the government deliberately kept this dole money to a minimum, just enough to pay the rent and buy food. There was no money for clothes, sports and leisure activities. Huge parts of the Dutch economy fell to a stand still. In Rotterdam and other Dutch harbors the immense Dutch fleet of barges layed still and went to rust. Many industries came to a halt as well. Off the working population 1 in 4 men were on the dole for a year of much longer. Especially the metal industry was hit the hardest with 40% of its workforce becoming unemployed. The previous industrial strength of the Netherlands was no more. By the mid 1930s the Dutch decided to take action by introducing the \"Werkverschaffing\" labour provision scheme. It was deemed better for the country to put the unemployed to work on government funded schemes in stead of hordes of men loytering around all day doing nothing. As an incentive, payment was slightly better than remaining on the dole. One of the schemes was to re-develop farmland, especially around the picturesk town of Giethorn, to revive neglected farmland. At the beginning of every week trains filled with labourers would stop in the middle of nowhere to enable them to work the land. Canals were dug to provide the needed irrigation and drainage for the new farmland. Dykes were constructed to improve the protection of the Dutch low lands from the sea and river floods. In Amsterdam a complete new forest area was constructed: the Amsterdamse bos. A major project was started aimed at damping of the Zuiderzee in order to create new agricultural land. Heavily meandering rivers were straightened by digging new connections to cut off extreme river bends.  Also the Castle at Hoensbroek in the province of Limburg was restaured. Young people received training to build up arts and crafts and construction skills. New huge locks were built at IJmuiden in the Noordzee kanaal that connects Amsterdam with the Northsea. Much earlier than countries like England, steam trains were replaced and the whole rail network electrified. Many new housing complexes were built and ship building was also on the rise. The forced labour provision scheme was not without controversy. Left wing Dutch politicians frequently attacked the government for not doing enough to get the country back on the rails and being too frugal in their spending. SECOND WORLD WAR ================ On 10th of May 1940 the Netherlands entered the second world war. At the time the effects of the crisis years were still ongoing. Four days later the Netherlands already suffered its first mayor blow with the terrible bombardment of Rotterdam's city center by the Germans.  Most of the old center was destroyed, 800 people were killed and 80.000 became homeless. The Dutch capitulated and the country went into a state of a war economy. Ironically the war brought an end to the enemployment situation. By the end of 1940 Germany's Reichs commissioner Seiss Inquart proclaimed that he had succeeded in eradicating the unemployement situation. Many young Dutch people were deported to Germany as part of the \"Arbeidseinsatz\" scheme. The Netherlands fell back to become basically an agricultural economy supplemented by war industry in support of the German war effort. Besides Rotterdam being destroyed, other parts of the Netherlands also got severely damaged, not in the last due due to allied forces attacks. In that respect the bombardments of The Hagues Bezuidenhout quarters in March 1945 due to an RAF navigation error should be mentioned. Similarly Nijmegen suffered a serious mistaken bombardment by the Americans on their way back from Germany on 22 Februari 1944. Rotterdam was also bombed by the Americans in the so-called forgotten bombardement on 31 March 1943 and towards the end of the war in February 1945 the Wieringermeer was deliberately floaded by the Germans.  Zeeland suffered a similar fate by being bombed by the allied forces during September and October 1944 in an attempt to flush out the Germans. Rotterdam's industrious harbour no longer had a role of any significance to play and towards the end of the war got largely destroyed by the Germans to stop the allies using the harbour for invasion purposes. Nevertheless, with hindsight it can be said that WW-II did have the effect of being the turning point to restore the economy and start to build of the country's future prosterity. At the end of the war the country was largely in ruins. Rotterdam's harbour was destroyed, large areas were floaded and the Germans had looted the country to the bone. Thanks to the Marshall plan by the American minister of foreign affairs George C. Marshall European countries received financial aid from the US.  This aid had an alterior motive i.e. by thus trying to halt upcoming communist influences from the East. Dutch minister of finance declared all excisting currencies as invalid and issued the so-called \"Tientje van Lieftink\" to every Dutch citizen to help them get back on their feet during the first week of Dutch government's money cleansing scheme. This scheme was also aimed at ending the black money market as well as halting the tremendous inflation. During the war the Germans had simply continued to print money to keep their economies afloat. Eventually people were aloud to keep their pre-war savings provided they could prove that these savings were not the result of activities during the war. AFTER WW II =========== After the war the Dutch quickly started to pick up the peaces and to continue where they had to leave off when the war broke out. The Dutch railways were further expanded and the total electrification completed. The KLM with their \"Flying Dutchman\" program started to attract more customers for their wide network of airlines that served the whole world, not only to the old colonies in Indonesia and the West Indies. The vast network of canals received a more prominent role in the transportation of goods throughout the country. The damping of the old Zuiderzee, now re-named IJsselmeer was continued and expedited with the aim of regaining even more agricultural land from the sea and with the construction of future new cities like Lelystad and Almere in mind. Thus historic fishing grounds were turned into fertile farmland. Within 5 years after the war the devastated harbour of Rotterdam was rebuilt and more and more started to serve as Europes most important gateway to the seas and oceans. Amsterdam's harbour also became more significant for the Dutch economy. Amsterdam's diamand industry also picked up where it left off before the war. Famous diamonds like the Kohinoor were cut here. The Dutch mines in the province of Limburg provided important employment to that region. All over the Netherlands industries were emerging and expanding like the steel industry, the fertillizer industry, the shoes industry in the province of Noord Brabant, and the production of Nylon fibers. Also the energy provision for the entire country was modernized. Since the beginning of WWII the population had started to expand to reach nearly 10 million by the mid 1950s and expecting to grow by another 2 million before 1970. Thus The Netherlands became one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Due to the extremely fertile soil, the Netherlands became an important producer and exporter of agricultural products, an important role that it has maintained until this day.  CONCLUSION ========== Overall it can be concluded that the Netherlands rose like a Phoenix out of the ashes of the Crisis years in the 1930s and the subsequent WWII. Who knows what would have happened if this war had not taken place and this mid 20th century Great Reset (to use a coloquial term) had not taken place. Fact is that these periods forced a change upon a dwindling global economy and also tought people to count their blessings and to come together to pick up the peaces and to make more effort to continue to live in harmony.",
