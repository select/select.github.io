    "Plot": "A man makes an unsuitable marriage and his family disowns him. When his father-in-law becomes desperately ill, he rides in a prize race, but is injured badly.The cinematography of this Italian short from 1910 is excellent and well-conceived. When the horses collide and a rider is injured, it is shot from a distance -- probably because the loss of detail made it easier to fake -- there is uncertainty as to who is injured, increasing tension nicely. The acting is a bit over the top, but considering the emotions, including anger, on display, appropriately so; I have seen elderly Italian women who are similarly histrionic. The result is a well done short drama.",
