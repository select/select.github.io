    "Plot": "Gandy Goose has just gotten a collection of magic tricks. The impatient Sour Puss wants to know how to do magic, so off they go to the magic shop in this very amusing Terrytoon.Paul Terry's crew had a fine two-act in this pair. Gandy Goose, with his Ed Wynn \"Perfect Fool\" voice and character was the idiot whose most improbable actions worked out. Sour Puss's Jimmy-Durante-voiced city slicker invariably got the worst of it. It all depended on their staying in character in these cartoons. That is why, despite the usual Terry habit of appealing to small children, I find this pairing so engaging.In this one, there is no one else, so watching this is like watching an impeccably timed two-act. I grew up enjoying the marvelous timing of Abbott &amp; Costello. There's not a wasted moment in any of the gags here.",
