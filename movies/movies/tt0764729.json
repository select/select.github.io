    "Plot": "Before he became famous for his serials and thrillers like FANTOMAS and LES VAMPIRES, Feuillade directed literally hundreds of short subjects, a lot of them comedies and, like this one, made to interact with the live musical accompaniment that played at the theater. This is a fairly good one, as we see the reactions of people who hear the hot new song.... and then their reaction five years later.It's clearly a studio-bound production; some of the sets wobble in a manner which indicates they are canvas back drops. However the performances are lively and suitable for any number of popular music hall song of the era.",
