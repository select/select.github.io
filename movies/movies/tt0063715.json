The second, \"William Wilson,\" tells the tale of a man haunted by his doppelgänger, culminating in his own destruction. The final segment, \"Toby Dammit,\" depicts a disillusioned actor spiraling into madness as he confronts his own demons. Each story explores themes of obsession, guilt, and the darker aspects of human nature.",
