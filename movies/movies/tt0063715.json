      "description": "Spirits of the Dead is a 1968 horror anthology film comprising three segments respectively directed by Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini, based on stories by Edgar Allan Poe.  The first segment, \"Metzengerstein,\" follows Countess Frédérique, who becomes obsessed with her cousin, leading to tragic consequences. The second, \"William Wilson,\" tells the tale of a man haunted by his doppelgänger, culminating in his own destruction. The final segment, \"Toby Dammit,\" depicts a disillusioned actor spiraling into madness as he confronts his own demons. Each story explores themes of obsession, guilt, and the darker aspects of human nature.",
