Cast Charlie Chaplin - Mr. Wow-Wow Mabel Normand - Mabel Chester Conklin - Mr. Walrus Mack Swain - Ambrose Phyllis Allen - Flirty woman Alice Davenport - Patron Reception A reviewer from Bioscope wrote, \"Charles Chaplin, as the very broke gentleman who is anxious to make love to all the pretty girls assembled to watch some daring motor-races, manages to obtain an abundance of humor out of every situation. It is just the type of film that audiences have grown to appreciate with great gusto.\" [ 2 ] Motion Picture News commented, \"Charlie, Chester and Mabel attend an auto race. Results? As laughable as were ever pictured.\" [ 2 ] References 1 Walker, Brent E. (2010).
