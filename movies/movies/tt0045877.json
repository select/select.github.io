      "description": "If you like this movie and our channel, please subscribe: https://goo.gl/0qDmXe | \"The Hitch-Hiker\" is a film noir directed by Ida Lupino about two fishing buddies who pick up a mysterious hitchhiker during a trip to Mexico. The movie was written by Robert L. Joseph, Lupino, and her husband Collier Young, based on a story by \"Out of the Past\" screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring, who was blacklisted at the time and did not receive screen credit. The film is based on the true story of Billy Cook, a psychopathic murderer. Two men (Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) on a fishing trip pick up a hitchhiker named Emmett Myers (William Talman), who turns out to be a psychopath who has committed multiple murders.\n\nIt has been called the first film noir directed by a woman, despite Norwegian director Edith Carlmar having made a noir already back in 1949 (\"Døden er et kjærtegn\"). The director of photography was RKO Pictures regular Nicholas Musuraca. In 1998, \"The Hitch-Hiker\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n---\n\nDirected by Ida Lupino, produced by Collier Young, written by Daniel Mainwaring, Robert L. Joseph, Ida Lupino and Collier Young, starring Edmond O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy and William Talman\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Hitch-Hiker\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
