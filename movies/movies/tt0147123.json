    "Plot": "The Roxy Theater is having its Grand Opening on Christmas Night (or else Santa Claus and his reindeer are just making a trial run), and Cubby can't get in as it's S.R.O, but he manages to sneak in and finds himself in the theater's Music Room, but not for long. He falls through a trapdoor (on the second floor) and is soon rising to the orchestra conductor's podium on the first floor and is even sooner conducting the orchestra in a presentation of Faust (but somebody is singing about Figaro). Lots of sight gags, voice-caricatures, racial stereotypes, and the usual allotment of risqué moments in a Pre-Code cartoon.",
