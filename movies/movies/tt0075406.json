      "description": "Voyage of the Damned is a 1976 drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg. It  follows the true story of the MS St. Louis, which carried 937 Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, hoping to find asylum in Cuba. However, upon arrival, they are denied entry, and after being rejected by the United States and Canada, the ship is forced to return to Europe, where many of the passengers face tragic fates.",

    "Plot": "In 1939, Germany's Hamburg-America Line announced a voyage from Germany to Cuba. 937 people, the vast majority being Jews, signed up for the opportunity to escape Nazi Germany. Unbeknownst to the passengers, the visas they purchased were from a corrupt Cuban director of immigration, and they were invalid. Upon arrival in Havana, only 28 people were allowed to disembark, while the rest remained on board for weeks as they sailed to Florida, and eventually Canada, searching for safe haven. Sadly the ship returned to Antwerp after more than a month at sea. Forced back under Nazi rule as the low countries fell, it is estimated that approximately 250 of the refugees died in the extermination camps in occupied Poland.",
