      "description": "Weird, funny, brutal, and twisted, three children of the Merrye family live under the care and protection of their chauffeur, Bruno, played by Lon Chaney, Jr. The \"children\" are afflicted with \"Merrye\" syndrome, a form of dementia caused by inbreeding. It's a \"made for drive-in's\" kind of movie, that will have you laughing and saying, \"ooh, gross,\" at the same time. The music is perfectly tacky and well suited for this film. Written and Directed by Jack Hill, Music by Ronald Stein I spent several hours, over a few days, cleaning up the audio to make this more watchable. There is a 2 minute demo, with some before and after scenes to demonstrate the difference.",
