      "description": "After a couple of hit men kill a gas station attendant (Burt Lancaster) who apparently was expecting them, an insurance investigator (Edmond O'Brien) pursues the case and uncovers a complex backstory of treachery and crime linked to a mysterious femme fatale (Ava Gardner). Based on a story by Ernest Heminsway. Burt Lancaster as Ole 'Swede' Anderson Ava Gardner as Kitty Collins Edmond O'Brien as Jim Reardon Albert Dekker as Big Jim Colfax Sam Levene as Police Lt. Sam Lubinsky Vince Barnett as Charleston Virginia Christine as Lilly Harmon Lubinsky Jack Lambert as 'Dum-Dum' Clarke Charles D. Brown as Packy Robinson Donald MacBride as R.S. Kenyon Charles McGraw as Al William Conrad as Max I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
