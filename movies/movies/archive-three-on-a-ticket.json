      "description": "A man stumbles into the office of private detective Michael Shayne and dies before Shayne can question him. The only clue is part of a ticket stub in the man's hand, which turns out to be sought by a variety of crooks and government men. Then a mysterious blonde femme fatale shows up, who knew the dead man, asking for Mike's help. Based on the novel \"The Corpse Came Calling\" by Brett Halliday Hugh Beaumont as Michael Shayne Cheryl Walker as Phyllis Hamilton Paul Bryar as Tim Rourke Ralph Dunn as Inspector Pete Rafferty Louise Currie as Helen Brimstead Gavin Gordon as Pearson - aka Barton Charles Quigley as Kurt Leroy Douglas Fowley as Mace Morgan Noel Cravat as Trigger I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
