      "description": "This film's 3.5GB MPEG2 file found elsewhere at IA is reformatted here as a much smaller MP4 with equal video quality. A romantic melodrama set against a background of the heyday of steam railroading. It's noted for its accurate and vivid depictions of railroad operations in the 1930s. The featured players are Louis Wolheim, Jean Arthur and Robert Armstrong. Directed by George B Seitz. US release 1930. UK release 1931. Complete print. TRIVIA: \"Danger Lights\" was the first widescreen feature film. However the 65mm widescreen prints, which no longer exist, were exhibited in only two theaters, one in New York City and one in Chicago. All other theaters exhibited the standard 35mm print. The Depression and then World War 2 halted widescreen development for the time being. CAST NOTE: Louis Wolheim is best known today for his role in the oscar-winning anti-war classic, \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Its trailer is here at IA.",
