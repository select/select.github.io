In the film's plot,  starfish -like  aliens  disguised as humans travel to Earth to warn of the imminent collision of a  rogue planet  and Earth. As the planet rapidly accelerates toward Earth, a  nuclear device  is created at the last minute and destroys the approaching world. The film, directed by  Koji Shima , was one of many early Japanese monster films quickly produced after the success of  Toho 's  Godzilla  in 1954. The film was loosely based on a novel by Gentaro Nakajima. After release, the film was met with negative reviews, with critics calling it \"bizarre\" and accusing it of using  science fiction   clichés .  Warning from Space  influenced many other Japanese science fiction films, such as  Gorath .",
