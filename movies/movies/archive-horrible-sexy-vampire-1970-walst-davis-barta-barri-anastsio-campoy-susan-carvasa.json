      "description": "The Horrible Sexy Vampire 1971 Odd movie. For starters, the original name translates more like The Vampire of the Highway but perhaps that is not as marketable as Horrible Sexy Vampire. As the movie opens we are treated to a woman taking her clothes off as her husband takes a shower. Suddenly he is choked to death by an invisible being. This is followed by a long series of cops talking, people reciting history, and random characters driving around. Finally we get to meet the very visible vampire as he is choking people to death. Yes, chocking. A vampire who does not drink blood. At any rate, we are treated to several episodes of women taking their clothes off and then being choked to death by the vamp. Eventually the vamp explains to our white-haired hero that unless he is killed (presumably again and permanently this time) and his grave left undisturbed, he will continue to kill every 100 years or so. For some reason our hero does not get to this right away though he does managed to get the job done.",
