      "description": "The 3 Stooges are cleaners at a spaceport when they accidentally take off and land on Venus. The boys encounter a talking unicorn, a giant fire breathing tarantula and an alien computer that creates three evil duplicates of the Stooges. Joe DeRita as Curly-Joe Larry Fine as Larry Moe Howard as Moe Jerome Cowan as J.P. Morse Anna-Lisa as Dr. Ingrid Naarveg Robert Colbert as Dr. Ted Benson I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
