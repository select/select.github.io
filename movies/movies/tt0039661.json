      "description": "Nightmare Alley is a 1947 FILM NOlR directed by Edmund Goulding, starring Tyrone Power, Joan Blondell, Coleen Gray and Helen Walker. The film is based on the 1946 novel of the same title, written by William Lindsay Gresham.   To make the film more believable, the producers built a full working carnival on ten acres (40,000 m 2 ) of the 20th Century Fox lot. They also hired over 100 sideshow attractions and carnival people to add further authenticity.   Despite a strong promotion campaign, the film was not a financial success upon its original release, due in part to protests against some of the scandalous content. The film has since found acclaim and is regarded as a classic.   You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and there are also reviews from the movie blogs D for Doom and Slant .",
