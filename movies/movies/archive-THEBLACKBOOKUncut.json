      "description": "“A visual treat” “Smart staging” “Intriguing movie” “Brilliant film” “Unusual and Stunning” “Exciting and very interesting” “Another stunning Anthony Mann film” (IMDB reviews quotes). NOTE: As of 3/23/19 this is the only complete version here at the Archive. A truly outstanding historical drama and adventure set during the French Revolution, and which traces the rise and fall of the infamous Maximilien Robespierre. Its large, worthy cast is headed by Robert Cummings, Richard Basehart and Arlene Dahl. Through brilliant staging on a modest budget Anthony Mann morphed fascinating history into a compelling thriller. Highly recommended. IMDB rating 7.1. Directed by Anthony Mann. Released in 1949. Complete print. AKA “Reign of Terror” (original title)",
