      "description": "Good evening folks, and welcome to the Digital Drive-In. We have a beastly double feature for you, starting with 1976's Track of the Moon Beast, followed by 1977's Snowbeast. Yes, we have a beast for every season. We'll also be featuring a delightfully odd Felix the Cat short, plus all the drive-in trimmings you could ask for.  So pull in, sit back, cut the lights, and grab your favorite gal (or guy!). It's showtime! And remember to visit our snack bar, for all your favorite treats!",
