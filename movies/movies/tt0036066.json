    "Plot": "This film, released in the series of Johannes Heesters movies - probably to celebrate his 100th (!) birthday, which will take place late in 2003 - could have been so much better. God only knows what went wrong. Perhaps it's too ambitious - it really tries to look like an American big budget musical, where showstopper chases showstopper and big production numbers seem to have swallowed a lot of money. But the storyline is weak, and Dora Komar, who might have been pretty good on the big stage, is incredibly tiresome to watch. The film stumbles under its own weight, and you won't miss much if you fail to see it - save some really good songs. But there are better entries in the series.",
