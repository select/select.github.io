    "Plot": "At an exclusive military academy on Sabre Island (played by Catalina Island), rich young delinquents think money puts them above the law. Enter Steve Conway (Mickey Rooney) - there to investigate the death of his son, who he had been told died in an accident. The Mick(ey Rooney, that is) finds himself quickly in 5 feet of trouble (over his eyebrows), when he's met with hostility by the school's commandant, Major Redfern Kelly (Dan Duryea), and the latter's sweetheart-secretary, Jennifer Evans (Terry Moore); intimidated by the cadet drill instructor, Vince Perley (Christopher Dark), and the P.E. instructor, Hack Marlow (Richard Jaeckel). Attempts are made on his life by a trio of cadets, known collectively as \"the 3 beasts\", and he's trapped in a 3-against-1 fight with rifles, Just to keep him tested, there's a big speedboat vs. small motor boat (Rooney's craft of course) chase through shark-infested waters. This happens right after he makes a startling discovery when he talks to his son's former roommate, 'Chip' Hastings (Warren Berlinger). The film was released in 1964 as Trouble At Sixteen, by Cinema Associates as part of a double-bill with Girls Town (1959) (now called The Innocent and the Damned, a rather descriptive title; considering the cast).",
