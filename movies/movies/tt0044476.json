      "description": "  The Captive City is a 1952 American FILM NOlR crime film directed by Robert Wise and starring John Forsythe. The screenplay is based on real life experiences of Time magazine reporter Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., who co-wrote the script.   Although at its heart The Captive City is an exposé picture, its bleak world view, extraordinary cynicism, and pervasive malaise make it an important film noir.   You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia . There are also good reviews of the movie from the movie blogs Where Danger Lives and D for Doom .   ",
