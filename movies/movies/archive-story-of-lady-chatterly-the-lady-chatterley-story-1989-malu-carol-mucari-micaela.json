      "description": "Yet another version of the DH Lawrence story. This time with Malu in the lead role. Played pretty serious here without the slapstick aspect of some versions, like Harlee McBride's movie. That is not to say there is no nudity or sex in this one, just that the original theme of the book is stronger here. Oddly I could not find subtitles for this one, so in the original Italian only.",
