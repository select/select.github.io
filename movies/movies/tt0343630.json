    "Plot": "Elvis Lives aired on NBC Thanksgiving 2002 to promote the recent smash release ELV1S 30 #1 Hits by BMG.  Rather than a documentary of Elvis' career, this television special was more of a testimonial documentary featuring contemporary people from the music, television, film and sports world giving their thoughts regarding Elvis.  Originally this television special was approximately 45 minutes long but an expanded 100 minute home video/DVD is to be released in late October 2003 by BMG Home Entertainment. Also worth noting is that BMG Home Entertainment is to release the comprehensive Elvis Aloha From Hawaii and the '68 Comeback Special DVDs in the near future, possibly in October as well.",
