    "Plot": "Black Wedding is a pitch-dark comedy on marriage. Not a single word is spoken, but murder is ubiquitous. It's the uproarious story of a husband and wife that artfully tries to kill each other - again and again, for 76 minutes, without speaking a single word. It's the way it is sometimes in a marriage. But the crafty couple pursue their devious plans without their daughter, who has sinister intentions all her own. And so one dramatic event chases the other - hilariously, surprisingly, and shockingly.",
