    "Plot": "This is pretty standard fare from the Mitchell-Kenyon collection, in that the scenes are either of people marching or groups of people standing together, staring at the camera. It's only interest lies in is historical significance. It shows General Baden-Powell, hero of the Anglo-Boer war, and his family visiting Accrington. The general is shown with, what I assume is, an important family of Accrington. Also a motor car is driven around. There is a parade in his honor, which is attended by a large crowd. Overall, it gets a three out of ten, slightly higher than most of my ratings from this time period of its historical import.",
