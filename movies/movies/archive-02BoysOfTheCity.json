      "description": "Hopefully, this file represents an upgrade in image quality to the others available on the Archive. from Wikipedia; Boys of the City  is a 1940  black-and-white  comedy/thriller film directed by  Joseph H. Lewis . It is the second  East Side Kids  film and the first to star  Bobby Jordan ,  Leo Gorcey , and  Ernest Morrison .  This film was a direct follow-up to  East Side Kids . After completing the pilot film for the series, producer  Sam Katzman  was able to convince former  Dead End Kids   Bobby Jordan  and  Leo Gorcey  to join the series. Katzman also brought in Gorcey's younger brother  David , and former  Our Gang  star and  Vaudeville  entertainer  \"Sunshine Sammy\" Morrison . Morrison had already known Katzman prior to joining the series. While this film is technically a sequel to the previous film, some unexplained changes are made (namely the addition of \"Muggs\", \"Scruno\", and \"Buster\").  Most of the cast from the previous film did not return.   Bobby Jordan   replaced   Harris Berger   in the role of \"Danny\", and would retain the role for a large portion of the series' run.   Jack Edwards   was originally slated to return as \"Algernon Wilkes\", but immediately declined after being offered a part in another movie.   Eugene Francis   took his place. Hal E. Chester  returned, but as his character was killed off in the previous film, he plays a different character here. This would be his last East Side Kids film. In addition to Chester,  Frankie Burke ,  Donald Haines , and  Dave O'Brien  all returned, and each reprised their role from the previous film. This would be Burke's last East Side Kids film. After his departure, the character of \"Skinny\" was given to Haines, while \"Peewee\" was given to  David Gorcey .",
