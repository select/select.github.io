    "Plot": "Tom Kenyon and his sidekick Pierre La Farge are hired by rancher Mike O'Day who, with his daughters Toni and Sugar, provides wild horses for the government remount station. Ed Spencer, owner of the railroad spur through the town, and Ted Greenway, rancher and owner of the right-of-way which provides the only other route to the station, form a combine through which they hope to freeze the other ranchers out of their holdings by charging exorbitant prices to the ranchers to get their horses or cattle shipped. At a meeting of the ranchers, Tom discloses that he is a government man and has a plan to beat the scheme since they can't afford the railroad fees nor the water cost if they use he trail. Tom will buy the stock as a government agent since there is a clause that states that animals bought for government use are allowed water rights on anyone's property while traveling the trail they have to use. Spencer and Greenway are not overly thrilled with this news so they go to Plan B, which is to just steal the stock outright.",
