      "description": "“Zaney, innocent fun” “Decidedly odd” “A must see movie” (IMDB reviews quotes). A dotty old fan of a children’s comic book ropes its straight-laced author into taking part in a madcap crime caper. Margaret Rutherford and Richard Hearne lead a solid cast. Good production values. Recommended screwball fun. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by John Guillermin. Released in 1952 (UK). Complete print.",
