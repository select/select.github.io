      "description": "An American secret agent (Rod Cameron), along with British (Constance Worth) and Chinese (Roland Got) agents, battle the Japanese Black Dragon Society, a secretive ring that smuggles enemy agents into the U.S. disguised as mummies. 15-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
