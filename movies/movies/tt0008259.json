You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation     \"The Man Without a Country\" is a drama, included in our program to illustrate the work and contributions of our star Florence La Badie. This was her last film - she died 34 days after the film's release as a result of injuries sustained in an auto accident. She was only 29. Florence La Badie plays an outstanding role in this film. There is one particularly memorable scene, in which she publicly defies her fiance to choose between wearing a patriotic pin instead of being a pacifist and getting back her engagement ring. Florence La Badie does all this in the midst of a pacifist crowd and further shocks all present by declaring that whoever does not support the US soldiers is an enemy.

Time passes, now grown to adulthood, Barbara, becomes engaged to a wealthy young man who believes in pacifism. When the United States declares war on Germany, Barbara's fiance declines to enlist, and so Barbara gives him back his engagement ring and goes to France as a Red Cross nurse. En route, her steamer is torpedoed and Barbara is assumed to be drowned. Even this tragedy does not inspire the young man's patriotism and when solicited to enlist, he declares that the United States be damned. These sentiments shock an old friend of his father's, who brings the young man a copy of the book The Man Without a Country . Upon reading the book, the young man visualizes the story of Philip Nolan and is compelled to serve his country. As he is about to go to war, Barbara returns, and the two lovers embrace.",
