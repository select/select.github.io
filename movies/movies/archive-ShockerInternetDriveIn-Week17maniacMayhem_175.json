      "description": "What better way to enjoy a cold crisp January evening then to pack up the loved one and speed off to the drive in for a \"bloody\" good time. We here at the old Shocker Internet Drive In are more than happy to oblige with a wonderful double feature of boobs, blood, and bad film making. First up, we are ashamed to present that mid-sixities classic example of back yard film making, \"Manos - The Hands of Fate\", followed by that equally inept piece of celluloid silliness, \"Bloody Pit of Horror\", featuring the father of that chick on \"Law & Order: SVU\". As usual, we have included a bunch of snack bar ads, movie trailers, and a Tex Avery cartoon. So, turn the heat up, turn the speakers up, and snuggle in for a scary (and stupid) night of \"Maniac Mayhem\"! http://Movie Website: http://shockerdrivein.dx.am or http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com Facebook Address:  https://www.facebook.com/shockerdrivein.dx.am",
