      "description": "Power-hungry mayor Ace Brockway (Charles Wilson) is trying to drive trader Matt Carter (Thomas Jackson) out of business by having Indians attack his trading posts and supply wagons.  Steve Blake (Charles Starrett), alias the masked Durango Kid, arrives in town, signing on as deputy to the inept marshal (Smiley Burnette), and making friends with the local newspaper editor (Paul Canpbell) and Carter's daughter (Patricia Barry). Blake works to foil Brockway's scheme, starting with his supplying of rifles to the Indians. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
