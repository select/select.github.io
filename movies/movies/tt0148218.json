    "Plot": "One of Terrytoons Studios' better theatrical series was that for Gandy Goose and Sourpuss the Cat. Not that it was consistent though, or completely great. There were misfires ('Who's Who in the Jungle' and 'It's All in the Stars' being examples) but also some good efforts (such as 'The Exterminator' and especially 'Post War Inventions'). One of the most familiar types of stories in their cartoons was the dreams/nightmares-type ones. The cartoons using it varied too.1946's (another big, and variable, year for Gandy and Sourpuss) 'The Golden Hen' is among their better cartoons, and certainly one of their better dream/nightmare cartoons. The rating as of now may indicate otherwise, but that might change once the cartoon gets more votes. When you compare 'The Golden Hen' with say 'It's All in the Stars' for instance, the comparison is being made as that also has Gandy and Sourpuss and is also a dream/nightmare-type cartoon of their series, in my mind there is no doubt which is the better cartoon as indicated already by me.'The Golden Hen' is not great or perfect. It does drag, the pace is uneven throughout, a little towards the end where it feels like it was running out of material. Meaning that sadly it ran out of steam as an overall whole too, a shame seeing as the first two thirds were so promising.Also felt that the ending is one of those cheat-type endings that is too pat and one that one can smell from miles off, especially if you are familiar with the formula of dream/nightmares cartoons in the Gandy/Sourpuss series and those type of cartoons overall in animation.However, there is thankfully no abrupt or jarring gear change or tonal shift, and there is not a case of being a cartoon of two halves or having a section that feels too much of a different cartoon altogether. Gandy and Sourpuss fare well here in a period where they started to not be as interesting as in their early cartoons. Their chemistry gels nicely which is surprising for such a purposefully absurd pairing, that really shouldn't work but it does. Gandy is closer to the advanced Gandy than the one seen in his late-30s solo outings, a good sign as a couple of the series' cartoons from the mid-late-40s onwards did make the latter mistake which is infuriating. Sourpuss has nice comic timing and expressions, his material plays to his strengths and it gels well.Most of the pace is lively enough and the gags, and we are not short-changed in this component, are vintage Gandy and Sourpuss absurdity without being corny or too over-the-top. Meant in far from a bad way, as at its best that was part of the charm of the series and they brought a smile to my face. A lot of care and affection clearly went into the animation, while the music as ever is the biggest star with its snappy rhythms and lush scoring never at odds with the action.Overall, not great but above average and one of the duo's better dream/nightmares cartoons and cartoons overall. 6/10",
