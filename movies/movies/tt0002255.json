    "Plot": "A cigar drummer comes to the village and is at once attracted by Hank Hawkins' sweetheart, who is in turn flattered by his attentions. Poor Hank is forgotten even by his sweetheart's folks, with whom the drummer makes quite a hit. A party is given at the girl's house, to which Hank does not receive an \"invite.\" As the drummer is the guest of honor he is master of ceremonies, hence when a suggestion is made to make some taffy, he insists on cooking it. Hank views the festivities through the window, and, to get even, he doses the taffy, which they put on the windowsill to cool, with Tobasco sauce. You may imagine the result.",
