    "Plot": "Popeye is on a training ship, but his seat-of-the-pants ways don't fit in with modern equipment. First, told to raise anchor, he hauls it up by hand instead of using the winch, making the ship dip down into the water. His attempts to aim the guns only ties them up in a knot. Finally, he takes \"dive bomber\" on the side of an airplane far too literally, doing a jackknife, swan, and ultimately belly-flop into the drink. This gets him KP, peeling onions, until the ship is surrounded by enemy ships. The by-the-book (literally) sailors take too long to fire, which is all Popeye can stands; he grabs the gun and takes out the fleet, first like a shooting gallery, then treating the planes as skeet. Finally, he has his spinach and acts as a human torpedo against the biggest ship. This gets him an award: becoming the official insignia for the Navy's bomb squadron.",
