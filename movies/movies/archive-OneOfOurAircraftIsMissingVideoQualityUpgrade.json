      "description": "This new transfer is sharper than and without the green cast of the existing IA copy. One of the enduring dramas of World War 2 is this fictional adventure of an RAF Wellington crew shot down over Nazi-occupied Holland. If some plot elements stretch credulity, remember this was a British home front morale booster produced during some of the darkest days of the war. Its solid cast and excellent production make it a must for fans of the genre. Co-directed by Emeric Pressburger & Michael Powell. Released in 1942. Complete print (unedited UK version) PRODUCTION NOTE: The first of 14 outstanding films produced by the legendaery Powell and Pressburger team. Another example of which is \"49th Parallel.\" It is available here in the Picfixer Feature Film Collection. CAST NOTE: Peter Ustinov's feature film debut. TRIVIA: The character rear gunner Sir George Corbett played by Godfrey Tearle was based on a real person, 55-year-old Sir Arnold Talbot Wilson who was killed in 1940 when his bomber was shot down over France.",
