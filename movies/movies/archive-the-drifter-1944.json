      "description": "Reformed outlaw Billy Carson (Buster Crabbe) rides the range trying to help others, but runs across another outlaw named Drifter Davis who looks just like him (also played by Crabbe) and who tries to cash in on Carson's reputation. With  Al St. John as Carson's pal Fuzzy Q. Jones. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
