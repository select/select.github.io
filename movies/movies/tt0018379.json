      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Nominee of five Academy Awards and winner of three, 7th Heaven was a massive commercial and critical success upon release. It made Fox Studios a major film company and helped cement frequent co-stars Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell as box office darlings. This romantic drama follows two destitute Parisians who find each other as World War I is beginning. ",

One night, Chico saves a young prostitute named Diane from the murderous rage of her tyrannical sister. Despite her lifestyle, Diane is honest and innocent, and when the police arrive to arrest her, Chico spontaneously claims that she is his wife. Forced to maintain this facade or else both face prison sentences, Chico reluctantly allows Diane to live with him -- and in the process, love gradually blossoms between them. However, the dark spectre of World War I has begun to descend upon France, and Chico and Diane cannot help but fall under its shadow.",
