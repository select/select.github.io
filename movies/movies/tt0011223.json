In getting over the girl, the boy can focus in on the fact that he only has two more payments until the shiny new motorized vehicle in his outdoor shed will be his outright. On a day out to appear in a community theater production, the boy finds that the car and associated items are giving him more trouble than he wants. His difficulty in getting to the theater because of the car may inadvertently provide him an opportunity to win back the girl.",
