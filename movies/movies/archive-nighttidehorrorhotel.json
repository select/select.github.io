      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu with still shot of the title character and drive-in style audio. SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder, and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD features the movies TERROR OF ROME AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES & TRIUMPH OF THE SON OF HERCULES, as well as the preview and intermission reels to play like an old drive-in show. NOTE: FORGET WHAT THE URL OR THE IDENTIFIER  SAYS. IT TELLS YOU WHAT WAS HERE. I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP SO I JUS PUT A DIFFERENT SHOW ON THIS PAGE. Hope it eases some confusion.",
