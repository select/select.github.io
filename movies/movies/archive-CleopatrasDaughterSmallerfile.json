      "description": "1960 directed by Fernando Cerchio starring Debra Paget, Ettore Manni, Erno Crisa, Corrado Pani, Yvete Lebon and Andreina Rossi.   Back in the day, when Cleopatra and Marc Antony were in full heat and were plotting to take on the evil Romans, Cleo sent her young daughter Shila to Assyria to be raised by the royal family.   Now Egypt is ruled by the seedy Nemorat and his battle-axe mother. The two conquer Assyria and Nemorat takes the now-voluminous Shila as his wife.   But the lusty wench has the hots for the Pharoah’s goodly physician.  ",
