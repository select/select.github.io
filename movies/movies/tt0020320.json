    "Plot": "Wing Foot, son of a Navaho chief, is forced to attend a US Government run Indian school. There he falls in love with the Pueblo Corn Blossom and pledges to marry her. They are separated when she is called home on a pretense and forced to marry a tribe member. Wing Foot soon realizes that he will never be accepted by White society and returns home. After many tribulations, he brings peace between the Navahos and Pueblos and gets to marry Corn Blossom.One of a number of pictures made in the 1920's and 1930's that put a melodramatic story in an exotic setting.Unusual for being sympathetic to the Indians, who are poorly treated by the US Government and by most Whites.Most interesting for showing Navaho and Pueblo costumes and material culture of the time.",
