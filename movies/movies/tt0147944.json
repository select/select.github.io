    "Plot": "At the Amateur Fright, Spook Bones makes a hit with his one-ghost band. But Casper is kicked out of the abandoned opera house when he sings his friendly theme song. Casper just wants to make friends. But when he comes upon some beavers building a dam, all he does is scare them off -- all but one. Short Tail is heartbroken because the other beavers won't let him help. His tail is too short to be of any use. He and the equally rejected Casper quickly become friends. Later, the other beavers will see Short Tail and Casper in a new light when a wolf with a plunger-gun comes after them.",
