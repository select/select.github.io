      "description": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027866/ Forbidden Music, or 'Land Without Music', teams Jimmy Durante with Richard Tauber (now that's a strange pairing if ever there was one) in a tale about a land so obsessed with music its Princess outlaws all forms of musical expression - Tauber of course plays an opera singer who makes regular visits back to the country of his birth to appear in concert; but how will he fare under the new rules? Diana Napier (Mrs Tauber in real life) gives a chirpy and funny performance as the Princess, while June Clyde is also memorable as Durante's daughter Sadie. Durante is a lot of fun, as are the pub regulars who lie in wait for strangers who might stop by for a drink! And Tauber is in magnificent voice. He made only a handful of films but this is a slight, but charming way to spend an hour or so.",
