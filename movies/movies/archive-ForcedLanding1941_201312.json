      "description": "This is a fun adventure movie.  Airplanes, bandits, pretty girl, comical sidekick...  The copyright owner failed to renew, and it's been pretty widely copied and republished.  This copy is a re-edit of one that I found on this site.  I removed some damaged frames, cleaned up the audio, and replaced the crummy title cards (Alpha Video) with something that is a better match (better, not great).  Eva Gabor is in her prime and very easy to watch. This is not great cinema.  The action takes place in a Pacific island country, where everyone speaks English, with an assortment of accents.  One of the main characters, played by J Carrol Nash, has the appearance of a Mexican bandit, with a Chico Marx speaking style.  Just don't nit pick about such things, and enjoy the movie.",
