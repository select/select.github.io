      "description": "“Nostalgic escapism” “Engaging crime drama with welcome bits of humor” (IMDB reviews quotes). A PC (patrol constable) goes undercover to catch a gang of truck hijackers and root out their boss in this off-shoot from the popular BBC radio series. Hugh Latimer has the title role at the head of a competent cast awash in endless cups of tea. A crime quickie that’s diverting enough to keep you from hanging out on street corners for an hour. Followed by “A Case for PC 49.” IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Godfrey Grayson. Released in 1949 (UK only). Complete print? (tape transfer) AKA “The Case of the Guardian Angel”",
