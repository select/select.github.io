      "description": "“Painful” “Drive-in drek” “Setting new standards in movie badness” “Crap!” (IMDB reviews quotes). Limp female wrestling exploitation thinly disguised as a bad crime drama. Ed Wood regular Timothy Farrell is featured. Produced by the infamous George Weiss. (“Glen or Glenda” etc.). Three cheers for anyone that watches all of it to the bitter end. IMDB rating 1.6. Directed by Robert C Derteno. Released in 1951. Three minutes are missing (lucky us!). AKA “Blonde Pickup” “Wrestling Racket Girls” “Racket Girls” (original title)",
