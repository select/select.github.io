    "Plot": "Deeming Kate of too frivolous a disposition, the Hopeville School Committee, headed by Rev. Haskins, request the girl's resignation as teacher of the village school. Fond of her work and loving her little charges, Kate feels keenly the action of the narrow-minded members of the committee. Kate plans to attend the outing of the Hopeville Sunday School. The attitude of the people in charge is so plainly hostile, that the girl decides to stay home. Filled with bitterness, Kate imparts her grievances to her sweetheart, Ira, who is employed as a lineman. While the two are conversing, Adams, the station agent informs Ira that a break in the telegraph wires down the line demands immediate attention. While Ira searches for the break, the picnic train carrying the children of the Sunday School leaves Hopeville. A dynamite car breaks loose from a freight train and runs wild. Ira sees the death car rushing to meet the picnic train. Cutting in on the line, he wires Adams to sidetrack the runaway. Terrified, Adams endeavors to reach the switch in time. Old and stiff, the man realizes he cannot make the switch, which is some distance down the track. Calling Kate, he apprises her of the situation. With the speed of a deer, the girl runs down the track and pulls the switch lever, sending the runaway along a sidetrack just as the picnic train flashes by. The dynamite car is derailed and a terrific explosion ensues. The picnic train comes to a halt and the members of the school committee rush to learn the cause of the explosion. Adams tells them of Kate's bravery. Filled with gratitude the men beg Kate to return to her old position. The girl is about to accept when Ira arrives and interposes an objection. According to the lineman, Kate is about to assume more important duties; she is to become his wife.",
