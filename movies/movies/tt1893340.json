    "Plot": "Song Impressions (1928)** (out of 4) This three-person act has Jerry Williams doing the piano work while Dora Maughan and Walter Fehl do the \"singing.\" What we basically have is the two doing a comedy act where the dialogue is sung instead of just spoken in a normal way. I must admit that I found the entire act to be rather bland for a number of reasons. First is that the material just isn't all that funny and the jokes are always very obvious. I'm sure this here might have been big back in the vaudeville days but in this short it just never comes to life. Second is that the entire \"singing\" adds nothing to either the comedy or the film. The entire bit just really feels force and it's too bad because both actors actually do a nice job in front of the camera and they certainly play to it quite well. The piano and orchestra music is pretty good but it's just not enough to make this more watchable.",
