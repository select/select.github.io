      "description": "A woman takes a job as a nanny and housekeeper for a strange and distant father. As days pass she finds strange goings ons about the house, the house next door, and, the children somehow involved. The house is dark, filled with shadows and phone calls from mystery figures; figures who seem to be present in the house and the house next door. There are as many questions and nearly as many murders as there are assurances —Haunting and Thrilling, Dark and Remote— the manners of the house and its occupants are an utter mystery...
