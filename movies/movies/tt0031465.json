One mouse is selected to do this, but he has no luck until he's doused with vanishing cream, and then, somehow, he can appear and disappear at will. With this inexplicable power, he somehow, off screen, is able to cover the cat with bells, including yards of sleigh bells. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/one-mouse-in-a-million-1939/",
