For a long time, the town had been divided, with the cattlemen and cowboys having one end of town to themselves, while townspeople occupied the other end. Mitchell liked it this way, it made things easier for him, and kept problems from arising between the two factions. However… Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/abilene-town-1946/",

      "description": "Abilene, Kansas, in the years following the Civil War, is a town divided in two, with the cattlemen who want an open prairie on one side and the homesteaders who want to tame the land on the other. When a homesteader (Lloyd Bridges) upsets the delicate balance that had existed so far, the marshal (Randolph Scott) must prevent all-out war with no help from the county sheriff (Edgar Buchanan), as well as choose between a dance hall queen (Ann Dvorak) and a merchant's daughter (Rhonda Fleming). I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",

A line has been drawn down the center of the town where the homesteaders and the cattlemen have come to a very uneasy truce. The delicate peace is inadvertantly shattered when a group of new homesteaders lay down their stakes on the cattlemen's side of town, upsetting the delicate balance that had existed thus far and sparking an all-out war between the farmers, who want the land tamed and property lines drawn, and the cowboys, who want the prairies to be open for their cattle to roam.",
