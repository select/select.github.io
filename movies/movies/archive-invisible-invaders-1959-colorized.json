      "description": "Aliens able to make themselves and their spaceships invisible issue an ultimatum to the Earth and start committing murder and sabotage by occupying the bodies of recently deceased humans, like an atomic scientist (John Carradine).  An army major (John Agar) is assigned to move another scientist (Philip Tongue), his daughter (Jean Byron), and a colleague (Robert Hutton), to a secret underground bunker where they try to develop some some sort of weapon against the aliens. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
