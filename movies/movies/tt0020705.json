    "Plot": "Bosko and his porcine friend are hobos in a boxcar; they happily play \"Cryin' for the Carolines\" with Bosko doing vocals and the pig on the banjo. Meanwhile, the anthropomorphic engine is having trouble on the rails; it has to go up steep hills and pass over missing tracks. It even sprouts hands and arms to pull itself up a hill, but accidentally pulls down the hill's \"pants,\" revealing polka-dotted underpants. In this struggle, the train loses its boxcar. Now Bosko is in distress as the runaway boxcar speeds down the tracks and through tunnels. A cow appears on the tracks; but the pig has been knocked out. Bosko must handle the danger on his own.",
