      "description": "They Didn't Dig In... They Rose Up.\nBased on the real 1951 Empire Zinc Mine strike, this film follows Mexican-American miners in New Mexico fighting toxic conditions and racist bosses. When Ramón and his zinc-mining crew call out their company's lethal shortcuts, they're slapped with an injunction—so his wife Esperanza rallies the women to hit the picket line instead. Watch these fierce mamas face down scabs, shotguns, and sexist rules to flip the script on who holds power.\n\n\nBlack & White version: https://youtu.be/sk3-As0yh3k\n\n\nAvailable with Audio Commentary: go to ⚙️  Select \"English Descriptive\" from the Audio options\nFeaturing  C.
