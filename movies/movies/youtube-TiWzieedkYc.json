Castellari’s THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS (1978,) which would later inspire Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009).\n\nStars: Guy Madison, Venantino Venantini, Anthony Steel\nDirector: Bitto Albertini\n\n A German Captain and American Captain help each other survive the North African desert during WWII.
