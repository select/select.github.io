      "description": "A peddler of \"the best glue\" sets up his outdoor stall. A crowd gathers for a demonstration. As he gives his pitch, two observant cops decide drive off his customers and close him down, much to his fury. He seeks revenge as they sit on a park bench. Incensed, they give chase to administer frontier justice. The crowd, with a mob's psyche, cheers on whomever is on top. It's a pity because this glue really does work. Director: Georges Méliès Stars: Georges Méliès Rlease Date: 1907 Also Known As (AKA) La colle universelle France (original title) Good Glue Sticks USA Univerzális ragasztó Hungary Uniwersalny klej Poland",
