While cutting through the woods at night, the two friends are savagely attacked by mysterious creatures and Nate is dragged off leaving Travis- to run for help. After Travis's efforts to save Nate end up in the death of Nate's brother, Chris, the police begin to investigate the events surrounding the deaths. Did things go as Travis claims they did, or are his claims of Sasquatch-like creatures signs of deeper troubles in his world?\n2016.
