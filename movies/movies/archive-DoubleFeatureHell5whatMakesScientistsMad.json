      "description": "The 2am Theater strikes again with another insomniac double feature. Our adventures in wacky science begin with coming attractions and a cartoon. Then spark generators drive Bela Lugosi batty in \"The Devil Bat.\" The intermission featurette, \"Science in Action,\" teaches us how to boil water and stuff. Then in \"The Mad Monster\" George Zucco's basement DIY project is a homemade werewolf because Ikea bookshelves had pushed him over the edge. (Feel free to try all of this at home - except for the Ikea bookshelves.) NOTE: All the items in this mad simulation are found in various IA collections.",
