      "description": "Semyon Gorbunkov goes on a cruise. In Istanbul, he slips and breaks his arm. What he didn't know is that this was a signal for a gang of smugglers (a real smuggler - Gena - was also on the same ship). So his arm gets bandaged with gold and diamonds. After he returns home, the gangsters are trying to get their stuff back, while the police try to catch them using Gorbunkov and his arm.\n\nOne of comedies who preserves the flavor of a period and reflects the sensitivity of a generation. So, it is not just a comedy but a trip in Soviet every day reality. The inspired cast, the smart use of clichés and gags are the best ingredients for create a lesson about Soviet Union. A film who explores situations for a fresh image of social situations. A comedy which has the gift to do different image of era, using irony and the clichés, desires and nuances. A film who remains lovely decade by decade, and that fact is the basic virtue of film. \n\nYear of production: 1968\n\nInteresting fragments:\n\n00:00:00 movie start\n00:08:33 Bad Luck Island\n00:12:39 Russo turisto\n00:18:53 Damned melon (Short pobieri)\n00:36:43 Idiot, ice cream for the kids\n01:01:33 Song about hares\n01:16:29 It's not my fault, he came himself\n01:26:03 Taxi to Dubrovka\n\n\nDirected by: Gaidai Leonid \nWritten by: Gaidai Leonid, Kostyukovsky Yakov, Slobodskoy Maurice\nMusic: Zatsepin Alexander\n\nStarring: Filippov Roman, Shpigel Grigory, Kanevsky Leonid, Mordyukova Nonna, Papanov Anatoly, Chekan Stanislav, Nikulin Yuri, Mironov Andrey, Gulyaev Vladimir, Grebeshkova Nina, Romanov Nikolay, Svetlichnaya Svetlana",
