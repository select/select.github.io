      "description": "In response to overwhelming public apathy the 2am Theater presents this special wildlife conservation double feature with lots of guys in gorilla suits: The simulated simian adventures begin with coming attractions followed by \"The Gorilla\" with the Ritz Brothers, Bela Lugosi and a guy in a gorilla suit. Who could ask for anything more? (Tough luck, you're getting it anyway.) The intermission short, \"The Chimp,\" features two of our oldest best friends and a guy in a gorilla suit. The second feature presentation is the notorious audience rip-off and unintentionally hilarious \"The White Gorilla\" with TWO guys in gorilla suits. Wow!",
