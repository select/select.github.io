    "Plot": "Scrappy is reading Dale Carnegie's HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE, presumably for purposes of this cartoon. A bird keeping him company hears Scrappy say \"The early bird catches the worm\" and goes in search of one. But will the worm or the bird be caught?It's an amusing little cartoon, with the worm voiced by Mel Blanc the same way he did in the one about the worm onthe end of the fish hook: a nasal, dese-dem-dose way of speaking as he tries to talk his way out of a bad situation. It's amusing, even if it's not a great carton.",
