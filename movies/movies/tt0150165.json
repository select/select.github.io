    "Plot": "The Terrytoons are oddly interesting, mainly for anybody wanting to see (generally) older cartoons made by lesser known and lower-budget studios. They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content. Like with the Terrytoons from 1930 and 1931, the 1932 batch has been very mixed, the best being above average if not mind-blowing and the worst being weak. 'College Spirit' is a long way from being the worst of the 1932 batch, but to me it felt rather lacklustre.As said a few times already in my previous reviews for the Terrytoons, the main reason for viewing is mainly for anybody striving to see every Terrytoons available like me. Best asset is the music, which predictably is incredible. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. Some of the backgrounds are detailed and ambitious enough and it's a little more elaborate looking than the previous 1932 cartoons. Synchronisation is pretty neat.There are a few amusing gags and there is an unforced natural charm.However, the animation is still, outside of the backgrounds, primitive at best with a fair bit of crudeness, over-simplicity and choppiness.Story is not much of time at all and doesn't really go anywhere with a lot of predictability. It's too short too, needed a couple more minutes, and felt choppy as a result. The characters generally are bland, parts gets too saccharine and the gags are too few and not all of them are particularly funny or memorable.Overall, doesn't have enough spirit but watchable at least. 5/10 Bethany Cox",
