Of note mostly for as a document of actual vaudeville acts not long before vaudeville died out completely. Unfortunately, this copy was digitized poorly. The movie was shot flat (1.33:1), but this file seems to be forced to a 1.66:1 ratio, cropping off the top and bottom of the frame slightly, which is very noticeable during some of the acts recorded.",

      "description": "Boarding House Blues is a 1948 American musical race film directed by Josh Binney which featured the first starring film role by Moms Mabley. It was the penultimate feature film of All-American News, a company that made newsreels about black Americans. The film was the first starring role for Mabley and showcased her \"vaudeville-circuit comedy and captured her signature stances and expressions.\" The film was also one of the early iterations of Mabley's \"Moms\" persona. Plot: Mom (Moms Mabley) runs a boarding house for struggling entertainers, similar to the situation decades earlier when Mabley had lived in a boarding house for black entertainers in Buffalo, New York. When the boarding house is threatened with closure and all the tenants evicted due to non-payments, everyone gets together to put on a show to raise the money needed to save Mom and their home. The plot functions as a showcase for performance and comedy sketches.",
