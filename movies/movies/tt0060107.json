      "description": "Andrei Rublev, Drama, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nThe picture unfolds a wide panorama of the life in Russia at the beginning of the 15th century, when the Russian genius artist Andrei Rublev lived and worked. His creations showed the world a miracle of harmony, beauty, light, hope - and all this at a time when the country is torn apart by princely civil strife, and Tatar raids, famine and pestilence are chasing the people. The film is divided into eight short stories, which have little plot connection with each other, but paint a general picture of medieval Russia, which is taking shape like a mosaic work.\nThe film was included in the 100 best films in the history of cinema, according to a survey of film critics of the world in 1978.\n\nIMDb rating: 8,0\n\nYear of production: 1966\n\nDirector: Andrei Tarkovsky\nWriters: Andrei Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky, Andrei Tarkovsky\nComposer: Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov\nOperator: Yusov Vadim\nProduction designers: Sergey Voronkov, Ippolit Novoderezhkin, Evgeny Chernyaev\nCast: Bykov Rolan, Grinko Nikolai, Nazarov Yuri, Nikulin Yuri, Kononov Mikhail, Burlyaev Nikolay, Krylov Stepan, Solonitsyn Anatoly, Beishenaliev Bolot, Lapikov Ivan, Grabbe Nikolai, Sergeev Nikolai, Raush Irma, Matysik B., Obukhov Anatoly, Titov Volodya\n\n#Tarkovsky #Arthouse #Rublev #FullMoviesWithEngSubs",
