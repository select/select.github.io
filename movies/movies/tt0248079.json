The arrest of said bridegroom when he tries to follow the thief up the fire-escape inspires the bride to suicide. Her courage fails her, however, at the last moment because the water looks so \"mussy.\" She is kidnapped by the thief whom she tries to employ as her assassinator. Many amusing incidents happen before the bridal pair finally meet for the performance of the marriage ceremony.",
