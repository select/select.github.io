      "description": "Bigfoot, UFOs and Jesus - A lifetime ago in a sleepy Michigan lake town, Hannah Howard (Melissa Anschutz) experienced something otherworldly. For years the event was pushed to the corners of her mind, seemingly forgotten until a trip home starts unlocking her past memories. Can her advice-giving, hippy-mother (Victoria Jackson) or the small town preacher (Don Most) or her newly discovered, bigfoot-hunting brother (Josh ‘Ponceman’ Perry) help her make sense of it all? To add to the growing mystery, the strange events have started again upon Hannah’s return. Strange lights appearing in the sky over a place locals call the Devil’s Crossroads. \n2021.
