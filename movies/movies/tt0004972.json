Part I of the film includes the acting performance of our star Robert Harron. It concludes with the assassination of President Lincoln. Part II - Reconstruction - does not include any scenes with Robert Harron. It shows the rise of the KKK and portrays the whole African-American race as evil, vicious and intolerant. We have decided to show only Part I of the film to pay tribute to the contributions of Robert Harron.  The whole movie is abundantly available on the internet for those viewers that are interested.
