      "description": "Spellbound is a 1945 American film noir psychological mystery thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film stars Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, Michael Chekhov and Leo G. Carroll. The film broke every record in London, in both famous theaters, Pavilion and Tivoli Strand, for a single day, week, month, holiday and Sundays. Hitchcock's cameo appearance is a signature occurrence in almost all of his films. In Spellbound, he can be seen coming out of an elevator at the Empire State Hotel, carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette, about 38:50 minutes into the film.
