      "description": "Filmed during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, Carl Dreyer’s  Day of Wrath  ( Vredens dag ) is a harrowing account of individual helplessness in the face of growing social repression and paranoia. Anna, the young second wife of a well-respected but much older pastor, falls in love with her stepson when he returns to their small seventeenth-century village. Stepping outside the bounds of the village’s harsh moral code has disastrous results. Exquisitely photographed and passionately acted,  Day of Wrath  remains an intense, unforgettable experience.",

      "description": "\"Day of Wrath\" (original title: \"Vredens Dag\") is a notable Danish film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer , released in 1943 during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. The film is based on the play by Hans Wiers-Jenssens and explores themes of fanaticism, love, and moral ambiguity during the era of witch hunts in early 17th-century Denmark. Set in 1623 , the story revolves around Anne , a young woman married to an older pastor, Absalon Pedersson . As tensions rise, Anne finds herself torn between her oppressive marriage and her burgeoning feelings for Absalon's son, Martin , who returns home after a lengthy absence. The backdrop of witch hunts adds a layer of danger and moral complexity, as Anne's past and the accusations against her mother complicate her present.",

      "description": "Ruy De Mendoza (Christopher Lambert) is Sheriff of a provincial Spanish town during the time of the Inquisition.  Prominent Noblemen and their guards are found butchered, bloody, letters carved with a knife on their chest  only for the corpses to vanish shortly afterwards and the crime scenes completely cleaned up.  As Ruy investigates what is behind these heinous crimes, he finds a mystifying wall of silence, where even the widows of the murdered men deny anything might have occurred. Obsessed with uncovering the truth, Ruy finds himself in the middle of a dark and dangerous conspiracy that soon threatens not only his own life, but that of his family.",
