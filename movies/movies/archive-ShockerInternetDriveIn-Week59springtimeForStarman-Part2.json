      "description": "As promised, we here at everyone's favorite haunt are happy to bring you the second half of our special Starman (aka Super Giant) quadruple feature. Once again, after the usual stuff, including a cartoon, we happily present the 3rd English movie \"Attack From Space\". Then, after a brief intermission, we offer up the final Starman feature - \"Evil Brain From Outer Space\". As we always say, don't forget the kiddies and be sure to visit the snack bar for all the candy and junk food you can eat! http://shockerdrivein.dx.am/ or http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ https://www.facebook.com/Shocker-Internet-Drive-In-1079848878843455",
