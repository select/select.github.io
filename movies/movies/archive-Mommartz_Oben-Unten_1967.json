      "description": "With the Rockband \"The Iceni\" and NN Five men in white clothing floating against a black background. And in the split screen above the torso of a man. Below the lower body of the dancing girl from the \"dance loop\". More complicated is \"Up / Down\", that recorded alternately in slow motion and normal recording five male dancers and a female dancer. The image is divided horizontal in the middle so that the body of a man can be combined with the one of the girl. Then the camera is rotatet around the axis and in a different order again combined shots follow. (LEXIKON DES NEUEN EUROPÄISCHEN FILMS)",
