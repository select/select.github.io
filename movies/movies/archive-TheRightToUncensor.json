      "description": "The right to uncensor is my second student film and my first documentary film. This was a project that was made for a final to a film class I took. I presented the working print version of the film as my final with the intentions of going back to finish the film so I could put the final version up which has become this. This is a documentary film that deals with the issue of censorship. It takes an anti-censorship stance against censorship and is filled with a healthy base of opinions including facts on the subject matter and arguments. This film can also be considered as a drama/comedy as it is serious in its arguments and opinions, but takes a humorous approach to the subject at hand as well. The film tackles multiple issues within the broad subject of censorship which include the opinion of censorship, the right to think for ones self, the MPAA, regulation, fear, responsibility, violence in media, and education to name a few. It does not completely seal the deal for each subject, but does take a look in to each subject for a fair amount of time. To view the production notes of this movie (in case you want to see extra content and further backed up arguments to statements) please go to my website if you wish. http://www.WebOfCinema.Com Enjoy the movie and thanks for watching.",
