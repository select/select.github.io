    "Plot": "Two mutts are riding the rails until they decide to stop and enter a local dog show.The rather elaborate design of the two pups makes me think that Paul Terry was looking for a new series to replace the fading star of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. There is also a continual music score, two songs, including a new one by Philip A. Scheib and, for Terry, a conspicuous lack of looping to hold down production costs -- although the last might be an artifact of my looking at a Castle Films version of the cartoon; it timed in at a minute and a half less than the time listed on the IMDb.Although my taste does not run to the babyish-looking character favored by Terry's studio, the construction of the cartoon and the pacing and competence of its gag construction makes it very good.",
