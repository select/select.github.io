      "description": "The Naked City is a 1948 American film noir directed by Jules Dassin, featuring Barry Fitzgerald and Howard Duff. The movie, shot partially in documentary style, was filmed on location on the streets of New York City and features landmarks such as the Williamsburg Bridge.   The film received two Academy Awards, one for cinematography for William H. Daniels, and another for film editing to Paul Weatherwax.    A degree of patience is required with this film because while it starts out as a generally talkative mystery story, thanks to a final cops-and-robbers \"chase\" through East Side Manhattan and on the Williamsburg Bridge, it is whipped up to a roaring 'Hitchcock' end.   In 2007, The Naked City was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".
