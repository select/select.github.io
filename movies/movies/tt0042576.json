H. Hackel's mid-30's Supreme westerns - in this case 1935's \"No Man's Range\" with Bob Steele - in which Ron Ormond and Maurice Tombragel never looked back while giving themselves an \"original\" writing credit. Shamrock is summoned to the ranch of his stepfather Henry Oliver whom he has never met. He still hasn't met him when he gets there because Knowlton shows up posing as Oliver. Lucky Hayden is along as Shamrock's sidekick or, to be more specific, the role played by whisker-faced Buck Connor in the original.",
