      "description": "In a Scottish inn, staff and guests (Hugh McDermott, Hazel Court, Peter Reynolds, Adrienne Corri) are gathered in the bar when a flying saucer lands nearby and a woman (Patricia Laffan) dressed in black leather and a cape arrives, armed with a ray-gun. She explains that she is Nyah from Mars, and she was heading to London to find men  since the male population of Mars is dying. However her spacecraft collided with an airplane and was damaged, so she had to land for repairs. Nyah has brought a robot in her ship to help capture men, but she wants one of the locals to volunteer to come with her. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
