However her spacecraft collided with an airplane and was damaged, so she had to land for repairs. Nyah has brought a robot in her ship to help capture men, but she wants one of the locals to volunteer to come with her. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
