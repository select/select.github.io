      "description": "Hello and welcome back to a cold and snowy Shocker Internet Drive In. We realize that most drive in are closed this time of year, but we are happy to present two psycho slashers to get your blood flowing and hearts pumping. First up, after a wonderful \"vulture\" cartoon and some bloody good coming attractions, we bring you \"Savage Weekend\"- a nifty little piece concerning a crazed killer taking care of business in a mask (sound familiar?) Second, after a brief intermission \"as nature intended\", we close out the evening with a tale about a poor misunderstood boy with a hook for a hand who happens to \"Scream Bloody Murder\". So, button up tight and grab your date for some heavy cuddling and scares as we \"Slice and Dice\" our way through another double feature. http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://mysite.verizon.net/vze10ote5/shockerdriveinredirectsite/",
