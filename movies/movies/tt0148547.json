      "description": "The two talking magpies Heckle and Jeckle are watching the crowds going into the theater to see a performance of \"The Barber of Seville\" and decide to get some culture of their own by sneaking into the opera. The stage-door manager tosses them out on their first attempt but they finally get past him and have a typical H&J outing by running across the stage during the performance, changing into costumes, and evading the frantic efforts of the manager.
