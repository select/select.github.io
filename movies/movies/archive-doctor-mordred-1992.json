      "description": "Doctor Mordrid  is a 1992 American  superhero film  directed by  Albert and   Charles Band , and starring  Jeffrey Combs . The film was originally intended to be an adaptation of  Marvel Comics '  Doctor Strange , but the studio's rights expired during pre-production. Full Moon elected to still produce the movie, with the character renamed, and enough other changes made to avoid a lawsuit. Anton Mordrid (Combs) is a  wizard  sent to Earth by a being called the Monitor, to stop the evil wizard Kabal from opening the gate to  Hell . [ 3 ]  Kabal needs the  Philosopher's Stone  and several alchemical elements to complete the spell and open the gate, unleashing his minions from the  Fourth Dimension  upon the  Earth . Mordrid watches for signs of Kabal's presence for 150 years; as the time of their epic battle approaches, Mordrid assumes the role of a criminal psychologist, and becomes the mysterious landlord to Samantha Hunt, a research consultant to the police. Dr. Mordrid detects a series of thefts of the elements that Kabal is seeking, and Mordrid begins to search for his nemesis. Samantha is persistent in her attempts to penetrate Mordrid's secretive life. The battle for Earth spills over into the Magic Dimension where the gate is closely guarded by other good wizards. They are no match for Kabal, who defeats all but one of them. This survivor confirms Kabal's plans for Mordrid, and Mordrid returns to  Earth  to prepare his defenses. When Mordrid is arrested for murder, Samantha attempts to help prove his innocence. Mordrid reveals his true nature and his mission to her, and she agrees to help him escape. In the final showdown, Kabal and Mordrid do battle within the Cosmopolitan Museum with Kabal animating the  Tyrannosaurus  skeleton on display to threaten several police officers while he opens the portals to his demonic realm. Mordrid animates a nearby  American Mastodon  skeleton to battle the dinosaur while he deals with Kabal. Using his wits and his magical power, Mordrid narrowly manages to vanquish Kabal by having the mastodon impale him on its tusk while he's distracted, preventing the destruction of reality as we know it. His mission accomplished, Mordrid is called by The Monitor to cross over once again into the Magic Dimension and leave the  Earth  behind. Later that year on Christmas, he returns to Earth and spends time with Samantha, inviting her to come with him should he be called away again.",
