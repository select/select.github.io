      "description": "This print has slightly improved video and much cleaner audio without any of the dialog-masking noise in the other print here at IA. It also has a smaller video file in the standard MP4 format. FROM IMDB: This film was fairly closely based on the real-life murder of New York showgirl Dorothy \"Dot\" King in March 1923. Like the character of Miriam King in the movie, the real Dot King was both a perpetrator and a victim of blackmail, and was having simultaneous affairs with at least two rich married men. Directed by Richard Thorpe Released in 1932 IMDB PAGE: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023092/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",
