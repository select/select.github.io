While he waits, he takes off his horseshoes which fall to earth, hitting Koko. Koko throws a horseshoe up, and it hits the gatekeeper. The horse laughs, and the gatekeeper kicks the horse back to earth. The spirit of the horse reenters the horse's body, and the horse is once again alive. The horse kicks Koko into the inkwell.
