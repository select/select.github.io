      "description": "Hola and bienvenidos to your favorite squared-circle for Mexican wrestling mayhem and monsters por favor! And who better than to defend the honor of our cinema haunt than Mexico's own masked hero of the ring, Santo... or Samson as he was renamed north of the boarder. First up, after a few coming attractions and a calypso flavored Tom And Jerry cartoon, we start things out with \"Samson Vs. The Vampire Women\". This 1962 grapple fest features our hero battling a group of 200 year old blood suckers looking for some fresh blood. Then, after a brief intermission, we finish up with 1963's \"Samson In The Wax Museum\" as Santo battles an evil scientist and his army of monsters. Originally imported to the USA for late night TV viewing fun, we hope you enjoy Mexico's Masked Marvel on our \"big\" screen as much as we do and keep an eye out for more Latin Lockdown fun coming soon to our sinister cinema.
