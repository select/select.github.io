      "description": "Waking up with amnesia after an accident, a mild-mannered New Yorker (Burgess Meredith) is told that he left his wife (Louise Platt) a year earlier, started a torrid affair with a sexy blonde (Claire Trevor), and has become a murder suspect sought by the police. What is he to believe? One of the early examples of \"film noir\" that helped define the genre. Based on the novel \"The Black Curtain\" by Cornell Woolrich. Burgess Meredith as Frank Thompson / Danny Nearing Claire Trevor as Ruth Dillon Louise Platt as Virginia Thompson Sheldon Leonard as Joe Marruci Frieda Inescort as Alma Diedrich Jerome Cowan as Bill Diedrich I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
