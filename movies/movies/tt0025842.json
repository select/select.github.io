Popeye comes by and demonstrates the values of spinach: he feeds some to a tree, which grows huge and sprouts a variety of fruit; he feeds a hen, which lays a dozen eggs, and he eats some himself to resist a prizefighter passing by. The children, inspired, feed some to a couple of sorry looking cows, which grow into vicious bulls, sending them up a tree. Popeye saves them, and they finally dig in.",
