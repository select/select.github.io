      "description": "From IMDB.com Paul and Gabrielle, a young married couple, take in their neighbor's teenage daughter, Felicia, for a few weeks in the summer. It isn't long before the precocious and seductive Felicia sets her sights on the two of them. ---- Yet another movie where a gorgeous young girls moves in with a couple and immediately starts to seduce the husband. At least in this case Jean Roche's Paul is fit and attractive. Still mostly the story is a bit of wish fulfillment for the writer as everything works out in the end. English subtitles included as separate file.",
