      "description": "It is a rough world out there currently, so why not have a bit of CHRISTMAS ESCAPE for an hour or so. Queen Victoria, more importantly Prince Albert, played a major part in establishing Christmas as the most important holiday of the year for Great Britain as it was back in their time. Making this program with genuine candle-lit Christmas trees (hot work), filming my then young sons as I read A Christmas Carol - the re-creating of SNAP-DRAGON; the fiery, brandy burning Victorian pudding game, the use of my own special Victorian archive.. made this project an absolute pleasure.\n\nDirected and presented by Liam Dale",
