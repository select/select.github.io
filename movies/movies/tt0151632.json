    "Plot": "This cartoon is another Mighty Mouse favorite, featuring jazzy jitterbug music like in the 1948 cartoon \"The Magic Slipper.\" I love the cartoon's music and the Little Roquefort cameo that was added too.As the title says, the story is set in Mother Goose Land, where Old King Cole hosts a birthday ball for Mother Goose herself. Every character from the rhymes was invited; except for the Big Bad Wolf! Of course I found it strange for Big Bad to be in Mother Goose Land. Anyway, after a couple of failed attempts to get inside the castle, the wolf hid in the birthday cake, pops out and wreaks his vengeance on the Mother Goose characters. Fortunately, Mighty Mouse got the call for help from the Cow who Jumped over the Moon, and the hero flies from the moon to the rescue.Now as I say many times, I don't care about the animation, it's the story and music are what I love about this cartoon.",
