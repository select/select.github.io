      "description": "A megalomaniacal scandal reporter uses an unscrupulous agent to defame his sister's boyfriend, a jazz musician, as a drug-addicted communist in a press campaign, thus breaking up the couple.. A film with a strongly psychologically accentuated dramatic plot, cynical undertones, and a harsh critique of the corruption of a power-hungry and money-hungry mainstream press. It's remarkable for its intelligent direction, precise performances, and striking black-and-white photography.",
