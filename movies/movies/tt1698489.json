    "Plot": "Miss Diamond plays the harp, talks about her father, who seems to have had his own vaudeville act and, to top the piece off, dances around with a miniature harp. Her harp playing is excellent. Her talking is sentimental and her dancing seems a bit bizarre.A lot of these Vitaphone shorts from this period were simple replications of vaudeville acts of the period -- an interesting turnaround as movie shorts were often used as attractions or \"chasers\" in vaudeville houses during the nickelodeon period. The shorts provide an interesting although occasionally skewed record of the minor vaudeville acts of the period and this one certainly qualifies.",
