    "Plot": "On an isolated stretch of the California coast, a young musician comes to compose. The sea inspires his music, which charms a nymph from an ancient and magnificent cypress - she is the tree's soul. The man falls in love with her and pursues her. She retreats, and her spirit speaks to him from the tree offering him a choice - to cast himself into the sea, a certain death, with the chance that they would be united, or to turn away and live his life with her memory. Will he choose to be the sound of the sea?",
