      "description": "Star Shintaro Katsu sits in the director’s chair for this psychedelic and unremittingly bleak entry in the Zatoichi series, which is unlike any other in its grind-house grimness. A tale of innocence corrupted by sadistic, sleazy criminality, the film is propelled by  Easy Rider –esque editing and a trippy seventies funk score by Kunihiko Murai.",
