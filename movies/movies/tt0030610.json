      "description": "On his birthday, Porky's uncle sends him a silkworm that sews too much. (Text of note: \"Tapioca Hotel, Hong Kong: Dear Porky, Happy Birthday! I'm sending you a genuine Oriental Silk Worm as a present. Lovingly Yours, Uncle Pincus Pig. P.S.: When you want him to do his stuff just say- 'Sew!'\") The silkworm gets loose, and all kinds of things happen. Porky's dog, Black Fury, gets hold of the his bottle of alcohol hair restorer; he gets drunk and tries to shave, leading to more hilarity. This is a Computer Colorized in 1992. ",

His uncle sends him a silkworm that churns out articles of clothing when it hears the word \"sew.\" After a sock and a bra, Porky stuffs it in a pocket to prepare for his party. He uses some hair tonic, then his dog Black Fury has some for himself it's 99% alcohol. The guests arrive: a penguin and a goose. The penguin, shoveling in the food, accidentally swallows the worm, which starts churning out top hats, which pop open inside the penguin's head. The goose tries increasingly violent ways of remedying this. Meanwhile, Porky's dog, lathered with shaving cream, runs in and is branded a mad dog.",
