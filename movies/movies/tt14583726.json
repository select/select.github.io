    "Plot": "Bruce McArthur was many things: friend, grandfather, mall Santa, landscaper - and a ruthless serial killer. He lived a double life: his wholesome appearance and cooperative nature eluded cops for years while he engaged in a hedonistic lifestyle filled with violent sex that often went too far. He cunningly took advantage of his work as a gardener and buried his victims' body parts in the yards of his posh clientele. \"Catching a Serial Killer: Bruce McArthur\" unravels the twists and turns of the shocking investigation into Toronto's most prolific serial killer. Through exclusive interviews with McArthur's close friends and the homicide investigators who cracked the case and expert analyses by leading criminologists and forensic psychologists, this two-hour special uncovers how McArthur targeted, terrorized and murdered members of Toronto's LGBTQ+ community, The Village, for nearly a decade before getting caught.",
