      "description": "A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies  is a 1995 British  documentary film  of 225 minutes in length, presented by  Martin Scorsese  and produced by the  British Film Institute . In the film  Martin Scorsese  examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to four different types of directors: the director as storyteller; the director as an illusionist such as  D.W. Griffith  and  F. W. Murnau , who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; the director as a smuggler such as filmmakers  Douglas Sirk ,  Samuel Fuller , and  Vincente Minnelli , who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and the director as an iconoclast, those filmmakers attacking social conventionalism such as  Charles Chaplin ,  Erich von Stroheim ,  Orson Welles ,  Elia Kazan ,  Nicholas Ray ,  Stanley Kubrick ,  Arthur Penn , and  Sam Peckinpah .
