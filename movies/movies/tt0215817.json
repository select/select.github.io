    "Plot": "At a small and quiet corner of an empty street, an honest and enterprising hawker gives a small demonstration of his amazing universal glue's exceptional qualities, from his rickety stall with the rough wooden sign that simply read \"The Best Glue\". Soon, a small and willing-to-buy crowd assemble in front of his outdoor business; however, a pair of ever-watchful police officers rush to shut him down, scaring off the customers. Bent on revenge, the wronged vendor will go to extreme lengths for justice, but it's a risky action, and one could easily get a taste of his own medicine.",
