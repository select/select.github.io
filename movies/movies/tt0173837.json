      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This pioneering sci-fi/steampunk film follows jewel thief and disguise-master Filibus, as she grapples with a detective on her trail. She utilizes cross-dressing, an air ship, and even romancing the sister of the detective to get away with her crimes. Modern viewers praise the timeless themes and the uniqueness of Filibus as a character. One international film festival called her probably one of the first lesbian characters ever, while another stated that Filibus might be an early example of a gender-fluid character. Unfortunately, some reviewers have also noted that the plot seems disjointed at times.  ",
