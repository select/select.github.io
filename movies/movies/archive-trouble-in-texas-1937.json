      "description": "With rodeo champions mysteriously dying just before important competitions, government agent Carmen Serano (Rita Hayworth) joins a gang of racketeers in hopes of uncovering the killers. She gets help from singing rodeo star Tex Masters (Tex Ritter), along with his harmonica-playing sidekick Lucky (Horace Murphy), who is looking for the gang that killed his brother. In the process they foil a bank robbery and stop a runaway carriage filled with dynamite. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
