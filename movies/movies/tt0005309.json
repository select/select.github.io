    "Plot": "Fatty and Mabel, a married couple, visit the San Diego Exposition; after watching the parade, they rent a motorized cart. While Mabel makes a quick shopping foray, Fatty can't keep from flirting with and then chasing after a petite woman passing by. He follows her into a hula pavilion where he also is attracted to the plump Hawaiian dancers. Meanwhile, Mabel is looking for him, and so is the petite woman's husband. The ensuing arguments attract the cops, and it all plays out in front of the Exposition's fountain.",
