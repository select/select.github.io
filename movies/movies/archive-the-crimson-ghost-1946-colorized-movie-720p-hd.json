      "description": "The Crimson Ghost is a 1946 American film serial directed by Fred C. Brannon and William Witney . Produced by Republic Pictures and written by Albert DeMond , Basil Dickey , Jesse Duffy , and Sol Shor , it was the last serial directed by Witney. It is divided into twelve chapters and stars Charles Quigley as a criminologist who attempts to thwart the efforts of the eponymous villain to steal a device that can render electrical devices powerless. The serial also stars Linda Stirling , Clayton Moore , and I. Stanford Jolley . In the 1950s, the serial was re-edited as a six-episode television series, and in 1966, it was re-edited and re-released as a television film titled Cyclotrode \"X\" . By the 1990s, The Crimson Ghost was one of two Republic serials to be colorized . The serial's titular villain, the Crimson Ghost, has become a pop-culture icon due to the punk rock band Misfits having adapted his skull-like visage into their iconography.",
