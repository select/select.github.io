      "description": "Based on the story of L. Slavin. Thirty-year-old unmarried Nyura works as a saleswoman in a provincial town. Her life is uneventful. And it seems to Nyura that somewhere life boils and sparkles with bright carnival colors. One day she goes to a seaside resort and meets Sanya there. He is rustic and not spectacular - bears little resemblance to the bridegroom of girlish dreams. And Nyura runs away from him... Or maybe this is happiness - is it so simple and natural?\n\nYear of production: 1980\n\nDirector: Ivan Kiasashvili\nScreenwriter: Alexander Borodyansky, Karen Shahnazarov\nComposer: Bogdan Trotsyuk\nCinematographer: Bek Igor\nArtistic Director: Irina Shreter\n\nStarring: Nikolay Skorobogatov, Leonid Kuravlev, Andreychenko Natalya, Fatyushin Alexander, Bozhok Tatiana, Neelova Marina, Vinogradova Maria, Karachentsov Nikolay, Nosik Valery, Soloviev Alexander, Olev Petr, Gia Peradze",
