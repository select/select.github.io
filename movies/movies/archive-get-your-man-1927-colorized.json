      "description": "Silly romantic comedy starring Clara Bow as an American gal in France who embarks on a complicated romance with a handsome young Frenchman. Colorized using DeOldify technology. No soundtrack. The original print was very damaged and I cleaned this up a bit to make it more watchable. IMDB page: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017928 (Note: Although this movie is public domain, the colorization is copyright by me. My colorized movies are freely uploaded for free personal use. Please don't put them on your own YouTube channel and monetize them. Thanks.)",
