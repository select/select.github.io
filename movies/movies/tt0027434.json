The other son, Clint, and his mother Martha escape and reach St. Joseph, Missouri. Clint grows up and becomes a crack rider for the Pony Express. The kidnapped brother, now known as Ace Carter, has been raised by the outlaws with a contempt for the law. He is an unsuccessful rival of Clint's for the Pony Express job, which fosters enmity between them. Ace holds up a stagecoach on which Martha Knox and Clint's sweetheart, Mary West, are passengers. Clint takes the trail and runs him down. Clint later learns Ace's true identity and saves him from a lynch mob. Because of the circumstances, Ace's captors relent, and the two brothers and their mother are reunited.",
