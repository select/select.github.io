      "description": "“Nicely done with flavorsome atmosphere” \"Highly entertaining, well made mystery” “What a hoot!” (IMDB reviews quotes). This second of two Colombia Thatcher Colt mysteries comes with a hefty dose of ‘30s racism. There is big trouble in a circus that has as one of its main attractions a large group of black cannibals. (yikes!) Adolph Menjou heads a strong cast that includes Donald Cook and Dwight Frye. The mystery is well plotted and well mounted with excellent production values. So if you can stomach blatant racism give it a look. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Roy William Neill. Released in 1933 Complete print. AKA “The Murder of the Circus Queen” TRIVIA: A third Thatcher Colt mystery (“The Panther’s Claw”) was produced by PRC in 1942. It’s available here at the Archive.",
