      "description": "G-Man Allan O'Connor (Conrad Nagel) is asked by the U.S. Immigration Service to track down the leaders of a human smuggling ring on the West Coast, who are operating under the guise of an independent motion picture company to bring Asians into the U.S. in violation of the Chinese Exclusion Act. When O'Connor is met at the airport by reporter Bobbie Reynolds (Eleanor Hunt), who mistakes him for a New York actor in search of a movie job in Hollywood, he falls in with the idea so that he can meet some producers. Vince Barnett provides comedy relief as news photographer \"Bulb\" Callahan. Written and directed by Crane Wilbur. Originally titled \"Yellow Cargo\" I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
