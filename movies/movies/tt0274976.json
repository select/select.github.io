    "Plot": "This film was included in the three DVD set \"Saved From the Flames\"--a collection of mostly ephemeral movies that have managed to avoid turning to powder, catching fire or melting--something that usually happened with the nitrate film stock used up through the 1950s. According to the notes, this is a production by Tony Sarg--the father of modern puppetry. And, it's also his last film and only one with sound.As far as the film goes, it just looks like the filming of a marionette show--with lots of strings, a puppet theater and simple puppets and sets. I don't get the 'father of modern puppetry' based on what it looks like. Maybe if you are really, really into marionettes you'll find this brilliant.The story is set in what might be India--or at least a 1920s American idea of what the area is like. Black people, white people, elephants, deserts, circus tents and the like all create a somewhat confusing tableau. There's lots of singing and a sort of variety show atmosphere and not a lot of dialog or plot. You could do worse...but this isn't a glowing endorsement. Instead, I suppose the film is interesting for its historical significance...and for a chance to see puppet belly dancing.",
