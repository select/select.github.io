    "Plot": "Grampy wants to take Betty Boop out for a ride in his roadster. But Betty had a wild party the night before, and now she has to clean up. Grampy tells her to get ready, and he'll take care of everything. And he does. After wearing his thinking cap for only a few moments, he figures out exactly what to do. From using the player piano to press clothes to tying gloves to an electric fan and letting them dust the house, Grampy's ways are fast, efficient and fun. And in no time, with methods that range from the simple to the Rube Goldberg-esqe, the house is clean.",
