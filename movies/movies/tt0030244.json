The villainous owner makes unwanted advances, annoys and slaps her around a little, until a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman shows up. The villain kidnaps Betty and flees with her in his dog-sled, drawn by a dachshund. The hero dons his skis and after a wild chase, Betty is rescued and the mustachioed villain is laid low, never again to molest innocent young ladies.",
