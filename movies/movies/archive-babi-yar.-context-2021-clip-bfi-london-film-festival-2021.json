      "description": "Title: Babi Yar. Context | Бабин Яр. Контекст (2021) Directed by: Sergei Loznitsa Date of birth: 5 September 1964, Baranovichi, Belorussian Writing credits: Sergei Loznitsa Year: 2021 Country: Netherlands | Ukraine Language: Ukrainian | Russian | German | Polish Color: Black and White Runtime: 121 min. Synopsis Nazi troops massacre 30,000 Jews over a three-day period in September 1941. On September 29-30, 1941, Sonderkommando 4a of the Einsatzgruppe C, assisted by two battalions of the Police Regiment South and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and without any resistance from the local population, shot dead 33,771 Jews in the Babi Yar ravine northwest of Kyiv. The film reconstructs the historical context of this tragedy through archive footage documenting the German occupation of Ukraine and the subsequent decade. When memory turns into oblivion, when the past overshadows the future, it is the voice of cinema that articulates the truth. —European Film Awards Cast: Hans Frank, Dina Pronicheva, Hans Isenmann, Anastasya Osmachko, Vladimir Artobolevsky, Nikifor Timofeyevich Kalchenko, Nikita Khrushchev, Ivan Konev",
