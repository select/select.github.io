After his mother (Virgina True Boardman) asks the Police Commissioner (Herbert Corthell, who played Mr. Bronson in Renfrew of the Royal Mounted) to, he goads Bob into a bout with Patrolman Davis (Russ Clark). After getting knocked out, he meets and promptly falls in love with nurse Mary Prentiss (Geneva Mitchell). He decides to join the Force for the physical training.
