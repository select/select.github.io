      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This comedy follows a plumber aspiring to be an architect who is convinced into becoming engaged to a rich girl so she can attract the jealousy of another man. Wise Girls' story might sound a little convoluted, but for an early sound film it has a longer runtime to pad out and make sense of the plot. ",
