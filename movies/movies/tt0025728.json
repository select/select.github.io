    "Plot": "Although the Mel-O-Toons animated version of Robin Hood was much more accurate, they omitted Maid Marian and that's a pretty big omission. Here, the Van Beuren Studios were wise enough to give her co-starring status as should be required. The story, though, focuses on the rescue of Maid Marian and Robin's uncanny skill in the sport of archery. It is a musical version with all singing and no talking. In fact it even has an opening theme song, \"In the Days of Robin Hood\". A lot is told in the seven minute, ten second running time. Fans of Robin Hood, myself included, will enjoy it. Brownie Bear kind of looks more like a mouse than a bear and to add to the confusion it seems that this character started out with the name, Cubby Bear. But there is no ambiguity here, as the opening frame reads, A Brownie Bear cartoon. The picture quality is good but could be a little sharper. Van Beuren Studios also had the series, The Little King, and Tom and Jerry(not of MGM fame). Four years later Warner Brothers would come out with their live action feature, The Adventures of Robin Hood.",
