      "description": "A woman returns to her native California in time to see her parents murdered by the sheriff and his gang for their hacienda and their gold. Posing as an American visitor from Detroit, she adopts a Zorro-like costume and teams up with militia leader Dan Hinsdale and freedom fighter Joaquin Murietta to take vengeance on the gang and restore all the stolen gold to its rightful owners. Barbara Britton as Zara Montalvo AKA Lola Belmont Willard Parker as Dan Hinsdale Phillip Reed as Joaquin Murietta AKA Carlos Del Rio Barton MacLane as Sheriff Jim Harden Martin Garralaga as Father Antonio Victor Kilian as Jose Montalvo Thurston Hall as the Governor Angelo Rossitto as Nino Anna Demetrio as Maria Paul Marion as Manuel I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
