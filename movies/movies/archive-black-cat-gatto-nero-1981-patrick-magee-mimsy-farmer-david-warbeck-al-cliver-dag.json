      "description": "From IMDB: \"A professor with the psychic ability to communicate with the dead uses his powers on his pet cat in order to take vengeance upon his enemies.\" Really pretty much covers it, though it should be noted that somehow the cat can cause car accidents and set rooms on fire. Language is Italian but there are subtitles included.",
