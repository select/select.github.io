      "description": "Based on a true story, what started as a celebratory outing went terribly wrong. A group of college friends who miss the last boat to an island party are held hostage by the deranged fishing boat crew they hire to take them across Long Island Sound. What follows is a gripping and bloody game of cat and mouse, where everyone does what they need to do to survive. \n2018.  Stars: Jeff Kober, Matty Cardarople, Caroline Day\n*Licensed from Uncork'd.
