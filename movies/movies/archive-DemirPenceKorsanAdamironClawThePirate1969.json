      "description": "Demir Pence Korsan Adam (Iron Claw The Pirate) is a wild Turkish movie from 1969. Our hero The Pirate battles a baddie who appears to be Fantomas. There is tons of action- there are numerous fights and even a little belly dancing. The opening scene is not to be missed- a sultry Turkish dancer does the hoochie-koochie while the backup band (who resembles a Turkish Iron Butterfly) plays some great organ-based background music. This movie is for lovers of cult cinema and old Turkish movies. It was directed by Cetin Inanc and stars Demir Karahan, Nebahat Cehre and Yildirim Gencer. Happily, it's in better condition than most Turkish films. There are two files, one with English subtitles, and one without. Enjoy!",
