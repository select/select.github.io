      "description": "\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" is a 1923 American film directed by Wallace Worsley and produced by Carl Laemmle and Irving Thalberg. It stars Lon Chaney, Sr., Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry, Nigel de Brulier, Brandon Hurst. The film is probably the second most famous adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel, following the critically acclaimed, much reissued 1939 masterpiece by RKO. \n\nThe film is most notable for the grand sets that recall 15th century Paris as well as Lon Chaney's performance and spectacular make-up as the tortured bell-ringer of Notre Dame. The film elevated Chaney, already a well-known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood. It also helped set a standard for many later horror films, including Chaney's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" in 1925.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Wallace Worsley, produced by Carl Laemmle and Irving Thalberg, written by Victor Hugo (novel), screenplay by Edward T. Lowe, Jr. and Perley Poore Sheehan, starring Lon Chaney, Sr., Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry, Nigel de Brulier and Brandon Hurst.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

Universal Pictures biggest silent hit, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a drama/tragedy that follows Lon Chaney's hideous but gentle Quasimodo. While this is frequently thought of as one of the best films of 1923, it is now mostly remembered for its colossal and gorgeous sets, and for Mr. Chaney's performance. ",

When he sets Quasimodo out to kidnap Esmeralda, Phoebus, Captain of the Guards, rescues her and captures Quasimodo. The courts sentence Quasimodo to be flogged, and the only one who will give him water while he is tied in the square is Esmeralda. After Clopin forces Esmeralda to leave Phoebus at the ball, she sends a note to Phoebus to meet her at Notre-Dame. In the garden, Phoebus is stabbed in the back by Jehan. Esmeralda is accused of stabbing Phoebus, convicted by the courts and sentenced to hang. When Esmeralda again rejects Jehan, he tells her that Phoebus is dead, even though it is not true. Clopin, Phoebus and Quasimodo all try different ways to save Esmeralda.",
