      "description": "A much improved, widescreen copy of Antonio Margheriti's first Italian space opera, \"Assignment  Outer Space,\" also known as \"Spacemen.\" The claim made in the Wikipedia article below that this film was released on a triple bill with \"First Spaceship on Venus\" and \"The Mysterians\" is a fantasy. It was originally released with \"Phantom Planet,\" and was (arguably) the better film on that double bill. This film is interesting for having a black protagonist, American choreographer, Archie Savage, in a pivotal role. Space Men From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from  Assignment Outer Space ) Assignment Outer Space Directed by Antonio Margheriti Produced by Samuel Z. Arkoff Hugo Grimaldi Written by Ennio De Concini Jack Wallace Starring Rik Van Nutter Gabriella Farinon David Montresor Music by Lelio Luttazzi  (as J.K.
