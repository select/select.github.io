    "Plot": "Dr. Bluto sails off to Darkest Africa for exploration. Popeye, who stayed behind, hears a radio report that Bluto is lost and sets sail himself (on a raft). He manages to land right by a trail left by Bluto, and after fighting a few animals along the way, finds himself, exhausted and dehydrated, in Darkest Africa, within sight of Bluto. We see why Bluto has not been heard of: he has a bevy of native beauties attending to his every need. He spots Popeye and rushes to his rescue, feeding him a can of spinach. The two then set to their traditional greeting of fisticuffs.",
