On a dark and stormy night, mild-mannered store clerk and wanna-be detective Johnny Arthur accidentally wanders into a nearby sanitarium. At the same time, his boss and the girl they both desire meet with an accident and seek help at that same sanitarium. Unfortunately for the three, the Doctor in charge is...Lon Chaney! The soundtrack includes two pieces by Bull of Heaven; The first hour includes a portion of \"As Two from Ten Thousand pt 2,\" and the last half hour includes \"Hypnosis, Drugs and Mind Control\". There was major distortion during the last half hour. That should now be remedied.",
