    "Plot": "Wiffle Piffle, mild-mannered and big-dreaming clerk in the office where Betty Boop works, proposes marriage to Betty and she turns him down with the song explanation that she pines for a Cowboy. Piffle catches a train for the Wild West and arrives at a cactus junction called Lily Ponds, primarily because Miss Ponds was working at Paramount at the time. He buys a dude-cowboy outfit and gets a guide book and how to become a real cowboy. The puns on the instruction pages are funnier than Piffle's misadventures. And the censors at the MPPDA office must have been dozing and didn't bother reading some of the instructions.",
