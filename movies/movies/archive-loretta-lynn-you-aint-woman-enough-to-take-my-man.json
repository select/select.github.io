      "description": "Loretta Lynn sings live on The Wilburn Brothers Show circa late 1960s. The full episode of the show is available for download as a Tar archive in the DOWNLOAD OPTIONS side menu. UPDATE: I've added another performance of the same song to the playlist. The only details I have are that it was apparently broadcast in 1968.",
