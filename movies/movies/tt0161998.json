      "description": "A cartoon that illustrates the old adage that you can take a pig to Switzerland, lead him to the snow, but you can't teach him to ski. But he might learn to yodel. This pig, surrounded by expert skiers, blunders along down the slope and falls into a bear's cave. The rescuers find the pig safe and playing poker with the bear. The pig is winning. He knew how to play poker. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/swiss-ski-yodelers-1940/",
