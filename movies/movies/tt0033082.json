Driven by greed, Brutal Captain Bucko Larsen (Victor McLasglen) is systematically crippling the young men of the tribe by making them dive deep into treacherous waters for the pearls he brings to Ruby in an attempt to buy her love. Roused by Larsen's ruthlessness, the young men of Kehane's tribe rebel against his domineering cruelty. A vicious battle ensues, in which the crude weapons of the natives are pitted against the firearms of the white men. The battle rages on to a violent culmination when Kehena turns the white men's weapons against them.",
