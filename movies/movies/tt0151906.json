      "description": "A pampered cat, the pet of a Park Avenue penthouse resident, is fed up with his life of ease with the best of food and tender loving care, and yearns to be free to roam Central Park and, perhaps, snare a pigeon or two for his food needs. He manages to escape and stalks triplet pigeons, and soon learns that the penthouse is better than the outhouse. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/park-avenue-pussycat-1956/",
