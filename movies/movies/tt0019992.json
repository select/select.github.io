      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. A remake of a 1921 lost film, The Hole in the Wall is notable for being the first film in which Edward G. Robinson portrayed a gangster. He would later become famous for these kinds of roles. This picture is also remembered for mixing horror and crime drama into one picture, although by modern standards it is quite messy. ",
