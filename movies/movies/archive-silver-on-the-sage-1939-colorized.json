      "description": "Bar 20 cattle are being stolen by unknown rustlers. Casino owner Earl Brennan & rancher Dave Talbot (Stanley Ridges) are twin brothers who each provide an alibi while the other is out committing a crime. Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd) goes undercover as a gambler from the East, getting a job in the casino to learn more, but is exposed when a gambling gunslinger notices him. With Russell Hayden and Gabby Hayes. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
