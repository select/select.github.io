    "Plot": "This \"issue\" of the Bray Magazine, is an early effort in Bray's move from the first American animation studio to a documentary and industrial studio. It's a bit of whimsical daydreaming, as a few drops of ink are poured into water; the water is filmed -- upside down -- and an artist uses the swirling shapes as the basis of fanciful drawings.It's a study in artistic mediation, the equivalent of cloud watching. Those of us who had the opportunity to lie on the grass and look at the clouds, offering images as they rolled past trees and houses (or occasionally, as I did, watched as the trees and houses rolled past the immobile clouds) may recall the meditative, almost hypnotic feeling of the activity. Here it is, made beautiful by the hands of the artists.",
