    "Plot": "Monkeyshines, No. 1 was shot by William K.L. Dickson and William Heise for the Edison labs. Scholars have differing opinions on whether the first was shot in June 1889 starring John Ott or sometime between November 21-27, 1890 starring G. Sacco Albanese. Both men were fellow lab workers at the company; contradictory evidence exists for each claim. The film was intended to be internal test of the new camera system, and was not created for commercial use; its rise to prominence resulted much later due to work by film historians. The film shows a blurry figure in white standing in one place making large gestures and are only a few seconds long.",
