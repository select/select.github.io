      "description": "“A neglected Gem” “See it if you can” “The way we were” (IMDB reviews quotes). Genteel British comedy ensues when family and friends gather for a two-day, postwar holiday in the country. An excellent (though mostly unknown in the US) ensemble cast is lead by Derek Farr, Frank Cellier, Marjorie Fielding and George Thorpe. Highly recommended. IMDB rating 7.3. Directed by Harold French. UK release 1946. US release 1948. Complete print (PAL transfer). AKA “Quiet Weekend”",
