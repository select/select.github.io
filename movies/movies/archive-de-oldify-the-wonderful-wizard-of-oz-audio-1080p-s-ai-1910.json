      "description": "This is a restored, enhanced and colorized version of the famous story \"The Wizard of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum, written in 1900. This is the earliest surviving film version. The role of Dorothy is played by Bebe Daniels. Admittedly, the colorization could have been better, but currently this is the best that the DeOldify software can achieve. The original B&W film has also been motion-stabilized and speed-corrected.",
