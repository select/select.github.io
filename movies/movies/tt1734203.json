      "description": "Jabberwock | Full Movie | Action Sci-Fi Fantasy\n\nAlec, a courageous but impetuous knight, returns to his home village having been summoned by his older brother, Francis. Finding Francis working in the family blacksmith shop, Alec learns that their elderly father is not long for this world. The brothers' reunion is short-lived as Cid wanders into the village, terrified and half-crazed and recounts a story of his attack by a winged creature. The onlookers scoff in disbelief, one remembering the myth of the fearsome Jabberwocky, as the red-eyed monster's blood-curdling shriek is heard and descends upon them with the body of a dragon, the head of a gruesome insect and deadly claws. Now the brothers must stand together, wield the Vorpal sword to save their home, the women they love, and to avenge their father's death.\n\n2011.
