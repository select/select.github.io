      "description": "Psychadelic at times, this unusual and memorable movie version of Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" has some creative details, and although it is one of the more obscure versions of the story, it offers a distinctive look at a couple of its many interesting aspects. The style is deliberately murky, and it has not so much as an inter-title, so that you do need to know at least the basic plot in order to understand what is happening. Check out the Jean Epstein version, too (also 1928). http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018873/",
