    "Plot": "The plot of the second of Van Beuren's \"Color Parade\" series -- shot in two-strip Technicolor because Disney had a monopoly license for cartoons in three-strip Technicolor -- is pretty much summed up in its title: it's the goings on at the Parrotville Fire House. The Old Bird is proud of his old fire engine. The youngsters are busy laughing at him and cheating at cards. When a fire breaks out...Visually this is done in a very simple style, with lined areas filled in simply with red or green or stippled colors. Van Beuren had this marked down for a series, and there were three made, but they don't have much going for them but the color.",
