Unfortunately, while everyone else remembers the music, he keeps forgetting his part.It's one of those improbably plotted Scrappy cartoons that flourished under series originator Dick Huemer. Even though the fantastic component of the device was absent in this one, it's nicely ornamented with the sort of detail that one often saw in live action series like Our Gang; and even though there's little need to have a cartoon do things that live action could do just as,easily, it's just enough over-the-top to satisfy.",
