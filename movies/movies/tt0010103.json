    "Plot": "Gina Ashling's father is in financial trouble, and Gina must decide whether to marry a wealthy man, become an opera singer, or marry the man she loves. An East Indian yogi allows her to look into the future and see what her fate will be if she chooses a path other than the one pointed out by love. Gazing into a crystal ball, the paths of duty, ambition, and wealth are all shown to lead to unhappiness. She sees herself in the crystal ball as a diligent schoolteacher, as a successful opera singer who has bought her fame at the price of her honor, and as a millionaire's wife whose reputation is sullied so that her husband may be granted a divorce. The visions of the three paths strengthen her decision to marry the man she loves.",
