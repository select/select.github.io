    "Plot": "Well, here we pay another visit to the Jones' domicile, with the same amusing results, for Jones cannot help being funny, and we feel sure that his obituary, not that we are in a hurry to write it, will read like \"Pickings from Puck.\" Mr. and Mrs. J. seem to be in for a dull evening, when the amateur dramatic club is announced, and then the fun begins. Jones had never been considered even a \"near-actor,\" but when he is selected to play the lover to Mrs. Trouble he is a brilliant success: so much so that Mrs. Jones insists upon playing the part. With this change, Jones' histrionic ability deserts him, and he is a \"frost.\" Well, things move along at a pretty rapid pace with the party, until Jones, in a jealous rage, ejects the bunch. The film is really one of the funniest of the Jones series.",
