    "Plot": "A bad Jack Benny impersonator narrates this awful Columbia color cartoon which runs through all the standard Hillbilly tropes in seven minutes.It's directed by Many Gould, who would go to Leon Schlesinger's cartoon factory. There he would have have a long career as a lead animator, regraduating to director during the waning days of movie animation for Depatie-Freleng. For the moment, he was working for Ben Harrison's unit, which produced the Krazy Kat cartoons. Although there's some interesting bits here as the narrator begins too interact with the hillbillies, it's a thoroughly tired and unappealing effort.",
