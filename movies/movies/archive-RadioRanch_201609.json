      "description": "\"Radio Ranch\" is a condensation of the 12 chapter, 1935 Mascot serial, \"Phantom Empire,\" which features Gene Autry in his first screen role as a singing cowboy. The 70-minute feature version was released in 1940. Copious plot permutations were lost in this condensed version, but what it lacks in coherence, it makes up for in fast-paced wackiness. This version is of higher visual quality than other copies here at the Internet Archive and elsewhere.",
