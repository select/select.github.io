    "Plot": "This 2-reeler stars Helen Gibson, the famous stunt woman serial queen of the teens, in a story about competing railroad lines trying to win the big contract by getting their shipments delivered first. But there's a problem. It seems there a ghost at a certain point in the line that rises up and scares the train engineer. He thinks it's the ghost of a fellow worker who died on that very spot. Gibson takes matters into her own hands and investigates, but she is snagged by the henchmen from the other railroad line and is tied to the tracks. Will she get run over by a speeding train? Will the ghost appear again? Gibson ranked with Pearl White, Ruth Roland, and Helen Holmes as a major serial queen of the teens. By 1920 the serials were losing their appeal and these ladies tried moving into shorts and feature films. Gibson never made much of a dent in features, but continued as a bit player in films until 1962.",
