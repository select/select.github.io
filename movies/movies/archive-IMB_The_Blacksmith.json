      "description": "This is the fourth \"Flawed Family Flicks Video\" we have added to the collection. We hope that it will give a new life to a great old movie. Cousin Buster is back, this time as \"The Blacksmith\"......Special Editors Note: we have created \"Flawed Family Flicks\" as a fun way to rekindle new interest in some great old movies. These remixes were originally created for my grandchildren, and it now appears many other folks enjoy them as well. These Movies are great classics in their own rights and don't need any help from us. Our remixes are often drastically shortened and heavily altered from the original versions. You should always be able to find the original full length version of these films within the Archive somewhere. We hope you will enjoy both our version and the original version the artist and director meant you to see. We salute the original great artists, directors, film crews and studios that pioneered what we see in entertainment today. Thanks for watching!",
