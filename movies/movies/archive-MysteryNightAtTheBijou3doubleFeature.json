      "description": "The 2am Theater reaches across the pond to merry old England for this simulated double feature program in a second-run movie house: The murderous entertainment begins with coming attractions and a cartoon. The first feature presentation is the classic Edgar Wallace old dark house mystery, \"The Case of the Frightened Lady,\" followed by a Robert Benchley short, \"Home Movies.\" Then the rising body count in a London lodging house baffles Scotland Yard in \"Shadows on the Stairs,\" with a worthy ensemble cast that includes Turhan Bey in his screen debut.",
