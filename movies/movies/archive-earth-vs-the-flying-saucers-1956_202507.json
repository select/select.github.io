      "description": "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (a.k.a. Invasion of the Flying Saucers and Flying Saucers from Outer Space) is a 1956 American science fiction film from Columbia Pictures. It was produced by Charles H. Schneer, directed by Fred F. Sears, and stars Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor. The stop-motion animation special effects were created by Ray Harryhausen. The storyline was suggested by the bestselling 1953 non-fiction book Flying Saucers from Outer Space by Maj. Donald Keyhoe. The film was released as a double feature with The Werewolf. Plot: While driving through the desert to a military base where an eleventh rocket will be sent into Earth's orbit to assist the exploration of outer space in Operation Sky Hook, Dr. Russell A. Marvin and his wife, Carol, see a flying saucer and accidentally record a message on their tape recorder. Once at the base, Dr. Russell is informed by his father-in-law and general that the first ten rockets mysteriously fell back to Earth. When Dr. Russell decodes the message, he encounters the aliens, who ask him to schedule a meeting with the leaders of Earth in Washington, DC, in 56 days in order to invade Earth without panicking the population. Dr. Russell develops an anti-magnetic weapon that becomes the last hope of the human race against the hostile aliens.",
