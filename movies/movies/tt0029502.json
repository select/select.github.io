    "Plot": "Porky reads a book of new dog tricks; unfortunately, his dog, Rover, is old. A puppy comes by and taunts him. Finally, it comes down to stick fetching. The puppy shows up Rover several times. Then Rover enters a construction site and brings back a stick of dynamite instead, and Porky tries to throw it away, but the puppy keeps bringing it back. Meanwhile, Rover has run inside to look up dynamite in the dictionary, and when he finds it, he rushes outside (where the puppy has lit what is now a whole box). He carries the dynamite to a safe distance, where it explodes.",
