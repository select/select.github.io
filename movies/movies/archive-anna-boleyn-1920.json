      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This historical drama had a huge budget for a German film at the time, and it mostly shows in the grandiosity of the sets and costumes. Emil Jannings shines in his role as the villainous Henry VIII, while Henny Porten is sympathetic in the latter half of the film as Boleyn.",
