      "description": "Safer At Home - Set in 2022, the Corona Virus pandemic has created mass chaos in Los Angeles and turned the city into a police state.  To escape the grim reality of life, a group of friends get together for an online party: a night of music, drinking, games...  At first, the night is an exciting departure from the boredom of isolation, but as it kicks in, things go terribly wrong and the safety of their home becomes more terrifying than the raging chaos outside.\n2021.
