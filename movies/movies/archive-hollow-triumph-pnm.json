      "description": "Note: This version features the 'Hollow Triumph' title card as opposed to 'The Scar'. As far as I can tell, both versions are identical except for the title card. My copies of 'The Scar' are a few seconds longer, but this seems to be just because of the different pre-title copyright notification and its not playing at exactly the same rate. For the P&M collection, I scour the web for the highest fidelity uploads of films, whether that be here on the Archive, elsewhere on the web, on bittorrent or even YouTube. When the highest quality version I've found isn't available on the Archive, I upload it! These are often much larger files than what are typically on the Archive, but, if you're like me, this may be no issue for you.",
