Williams Distributed by Keystone Studios Release date June 1, 1914 Running time 18 minutes Country United States Languages Silent film English (Original titles) The Fatal Mallet is a 1914 American -made motion picture starring Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand . The film was written and directed by Mack Sennett , who also portrays one of Chaplin's rivals for Normand's attention. (Sennett and Normand were off-screen lovers during this period.) The Fatal Mallet is one of more than a dozen early films that writer/director/comedian Mabel Normand made with Charles Chaplin; Normand, who had written and directed films before Chaplin, mentored the young comedian. Synopsis Three men will fight for the love of a charming girl. Charlie (in famous tramp guise) and one other suitor (unusually played by Mack Sennett himself) teams up against the third, and play dirty, throwing bricks and using a mallet. However, Charlie double-crosses his partner, thus losing his trust and the girl in the end. Reviews A reviewer for Moving Picture World said of The Fatal Mallet , \"This one-reeler proves that hitting people over the head with bricks and mallets can sometimes be made amusing.\" A reviewer for Bioscope positively wrote, \"Though rivals in love for the beautiful Mabel Normand, Charles Chaplin and Mack Sennett combine to rid themselves of a third poacher on their preserves, and the employment of a deadly mallet gives these indescribable comedians the opportunity for another genuinely funny farce.\" Cast Charlie Chaplin - Suitor Mabel Normand - Mabel Mack Sennett - Rival suitor Mack Swain - Another rival From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

The girl goes to another man with whom she sits on the swing. From the tree the two men go towards the swing and one of them pushes the one on the swing, which launches a mallet to the other two, who take refuge in a nearby shack. The character played by Chaplin goes to take with the other who is with the girl and take him to the shack. Chaplin hits the other two and goes to the girl, chasing a child who had arrived just before. The two men free themselves and one of the two chases Chaplin, who duels on the edge of a pond with one of the two while the other is with the girl. Chaplin drops his opponent into the lake but the other makes him fall too and goes for a walk with the girl.",
