      "description": "The Killers (also known as A Man Alone) is a 1946 American film noir directed by Robert Siodmak and based in part on the 1927 short story of the same name by Ernest Hemingway. It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Sam Levene. The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the killers referred to in the title.   In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"   Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his intentions was a fan of the film stating \"It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine.\" Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1946_film)  Suggested Film Noirs : http://bit.ly/36oLNCR The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.
