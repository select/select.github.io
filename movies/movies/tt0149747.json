    "Plot": "The cat seems to be knitting a bagpipe, so Scrappy and Oopie rush her to the hospital, which is run like a burlesque sketch. Soon the joint is overrun with kittens in this nonsensical but funny cartoon.Although this has been labeled as \"surrealism\" in the keywords for the IMDb, it was just intended as silly. It was not intended as a statement of High Art in a world that had ceased to make sense. It was intended to make small children laugh, and undoubtedly it did, even if the relationship to the Scrappy cartoons that Dick Huemer had been doing for four years seems to reside solely in the fact that the characters looked like Scrappy and Oopie.",
