      "description": "Letterboxed. Not to be confused with Al Adamson's Dracula vs. Frankenstein. This is the second film in Jacinto Molina aka Paul Naschy's Valdemar the Werewolf series of movies. (The first was \"Frankenstein's Bloody Terror\") Also known as \"The Man from UMMO', it stars Michael Rennie (dubbed by a different actor) as an alien from planet Ummo who resurrects three dead mad scientists in an attempt to collect all the worlds monsters to take over the Earth. There's a Vampire called Nosferatu, a living mummy, a Frankenstein wanna-be called \"The \"Faranksalon\" (literally \"Franken-science\") Monster and the wolfman played by Naschy. Completely bizarre movie mixing science fiction with gothic horror. It seems to be trying to recapture the feel of Universal's House of Frankenstein/Dracula formula rather than imitate Hammer, as European horror's often do. This could have been great, and indeed has a fan following, had they left out the space invaders, who seem completely out of place here. This movie was offered to Independent International and even they turned it down!!! The soundtrack goes in and out of sync. Sorry. Maybe you can download it and fix it.",

Carrol Naish), who is really the last of the Frankensteins and is now running a house of horrors by the beach and is performing experiments on Gorton's victims. One night Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov) visits the doctor, showing him the original Frankenstein creation that was buried in a nearby graveyard.
