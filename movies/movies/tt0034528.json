    "Plot": "Popeye's on a battleship. He's in class to learn artillery, but it's way too technical for him; when he gets his hands on the gun, he fires everywhere, including at his own ship. That gets him banished to the boiler room. A real Japanese sub comes along. The sailors can't handle it, so Popeye eats his spinach and dives in to fight the sub by hand.",
