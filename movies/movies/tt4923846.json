Over one eventful holiday season, she tries every avenue possible to save the farm. But when the town leaders notify her that they will seize the property after the holidays, her last hope to unite the town is to throw a Christmas concert on the farm, headlined by her former love, a ne'er-do-well country music superstar. As the day of the concert approaches, they all must learn the value of family, faith and community before time runs out.",
