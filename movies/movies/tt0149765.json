    "Plot": "Gus the Pig has had enough of being an office drone and wage slave. He quits his job and moves out to a broken-down farm, where a lot of the usual comic tropes associated with such rash actions take place in this solid Terrytoon.Gus is one of the more obscure Terrytoon starring characters and one of my favorites. He is a solid pantomime comedian out of the silent era with a personality that matches his body. Paul Terry's cartoon work had started a quarter of a century earlier and he understood visual slapstick. With a synchronized score that accentuates the jokes just right, there's little in this cartoon that will surprise you in hindsight, but a lot that will make you laugh while you're watching it.",
