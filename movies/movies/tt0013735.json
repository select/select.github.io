The squire is an enemy of the blacksmith, who married the woman the squire loved. The main story shows the children grown up. Bill, the other son, has become a doctor, and Alice, the daughter, is having an affair with the squire's son, who has just returned from college. Bill is injured in a train accident, and Alice, accused of stealing some money belonging to the church, tries to commit suicide. The blacksmith rescues Alice; the elder brother recovers and successfully operates on Johnnie's legs, and the film ends happily.",
