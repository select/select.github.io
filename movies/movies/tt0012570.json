      "description": "Starring Buster Keaton. \"This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show\" Keaton displays his many talents in this one. This comedic short displays not only Keaton's amazing talent, but some envelope pushing cinematography for it's time period, as well. The split screen shots which gave the illusion of more than one Keaton in any given scene were impressive even by today's standards. Certainly Keaton was a pioneer in the film industry in his talents and abilities! His works are still jaw-droppingly impressive today. You can read more about The Play House on its IMDb page .",

    "Plot": "Portraying more than twenty characters at once--including lively stage actors, an attentive audience, an orchestra, and an entire nine-member minstrel act--Buster Keaton pushes the boundaries of technical artistry and film trickery, in a time when effects really were special. With this in mind--after waking up from a delightful vaudeville dream sequence--Buster realises that he still is the play house's humble general factotum, and he must keep the show up and running amid delusion and disorder, identical twin sisters, Zouave guards, and a rampant orangutan on the loose. But, can a mere gopher yearn for recognition, and perhaps, love?",
