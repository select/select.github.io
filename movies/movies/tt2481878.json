      "description": "Both the final film of this period in which Akira Kurosawa would directly wrestle with the demons of the Second World War and his most literal representation of living in an atomic age, the galvanizing  I Live in Fear  presents Toshiro Mifune as an elderly, stubborn businessman so fearful of a nuclear attack that he resolves to move his reluctant family to South America. With this mournful film, the director depicts a society emerging from the shadows but still terrorized by memories of the past and anxieties for the future., ",

Utterly oblivious of his existence, an unsuspecting young woman in a white dress fails to realise that the silent intruder is closing in on her. Now, with every step, the absurd becomes intertwined with the obscene, intensifying the sense of dread and anxiety. What are the man's intentions?",
