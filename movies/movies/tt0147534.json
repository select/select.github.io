    "Plot": "Van Beuren cartoons are extremely variable, especially in the number of gags and whether the absurdist humour shines through enough (sometimes it does, other times it doesn't), but are strangely interesting. Although they are often poorly animated with barely existent stories and less than compelling lead characters, they are also often outstandingly scored, there can be some fun support characters and some are well-timed and amusing.'Spring Antics' is an example of a cartoon that started off incredibly well, showing the signs of something potentially very good, but very quickly goes off the boil with a completely different tone and most of the flaws that mar many cartoons in the series. It really is a relative waste of a truly great opening scene, one of Van Beuren's best. The animation was actually pretty in this scene, with some inventive snow effects, some ambition in the backgrounds and a Jack Frost character that looks pretty freaky. He certainly is the best character in 'Spring Antics' and is a rare case of something beating the music score in a Van Beuren cartoon as the best thing about it, he is genuinely scary and the only character to resemble anything close to a personality that's memorable or engaging. The music score is not far behind though. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. Unfortunately, such promising potential quickly unravels in a jarring just-like-that change that feels like a completely different cartoon altogether. The animation is far from great or even good after the opening sequence. The backgrounds may have improved, but the fluidity, crispness and character designs certainly have not, everything just looks erratic, ugly and sloppy.After the opening, 'Spring Antics' doesn't really go anywhere, not much interesting or remotely amusing happens, and the pace is a mess, sometimes hectic while the timing of the too few and bland gags lacks kick. It's all rather random and disorganised structurally too. Of the characters, only Jack Frost makes much of an impression. The others fall on the wrong side of over-cutesy and personality-deprived and drawn in a way that makes them unrecognisable as to the types of animals they're meant to be.Overall, great opening but lacklustre at best everywhere else. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
