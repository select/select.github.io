Having been offered her dream job in New York she decides, along with her boyfriend Peter, to accept the offer and move to the Big Apple. The future is bright and life is fun and simple. The couple are on their way when Ditte' beloved and charismatic father, Rikard, master baker and purveyor to the royal court, falls seriously ill. Ditte calls off the move to New York in order to be with him and before long her own way of life hangs in the balance.
