      "description": "Night and the City is a 1950 British film noir directed by Jules Dassin and starring Richard Widmark , Gene Tierney and Googie Withers . It is based on the novel of the same name by Gerald Kersh . Shot on location in London and at Shepperton Studios , the plot revolves around an ambitious hustler who meets continual failures. Dassin later confessed that he had never read the novel upon which the film is based. In an interview appearing on The Criterion Collection DVD release, Dassin recalls that the casting of Tierney was in response to a request by Darryl Zanuck , who was concerned that personal problems had rendered the actress \"suicidal\" and hoped that work would improve her state of mind. The film's British version was five minutes longer, with a more upbeat ending and featuring a completely different film score. Dassin endorsed the American version as closer to his vision. The film contains a very tough and prolonged fight scene between Stanislaus Zbyszko , a celebrated professional wrestler in real life, and Mike Mazurki , who before becoming an actor was himself a professional wrestler.",
