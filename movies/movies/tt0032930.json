      "description": "It's the Giants vs. the Red Sox in the final game of the World Series, and Porky's doing play-by-play for the radio audience. The umpire is blind; the bat boy is, literally, a bat, and the catcher's a fast-talking turtle. The Giant's pitcher is literally a giant. And of course, as with any New York-Boston matchup, the Giants win. This is the Computer Colorized version from 1995.",
