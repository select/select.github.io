      "description": "Go for Broke! (1951) is an American war drama film directed by Robert Pirosh and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This restored and colorized edition revives a powerful World War II story that not only entertains but also honors the bravery of Japanese-American soldiers who served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. With Van Johnson in the lead role, the film blends Hollywood storytelling with authentic history, making it one of the most meaningful and historically significant war dramas of the postwar era.\n\nThe 442nd Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment of the United States Army. The regiment including the 100th Infantry Battalion is best known as the most decorated unit in U.S. military history, and as a fighting unit composed almost entirely of second-generation American soldiers of Japanese ancestry (Nisei) who fought in World War II.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe film follows Lieutenant Michael Grayson (Van Johnson), a young officer assigned to command a unit of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a battalion composed almost entirely of Japanese-American soldiers, many of whom volunteered from internment camps. Initially, Grayson harbors prejudice and skepticism toward his men, doubting their loyalty and capability.\n\nThrough campaigns in Italy and France, the 442nd proves their extraordinary courage, discipline, and skill. Facing harsh battles, extreme losses, and acts of heroism, the unit earns respect not only from Grayson but from the U.S. Army at large. Grayson’s journey from skepticism to admiration mirrors the larger recognition of the Japanese-American contribution to the war effort.\n\nThe story climaxes in the 442nd’s historic rescue of the Lost Battalion in France, where their relentless advance and heavy sacrifices cemented their reputation as one of the most decorated units in American military history. The film closes with a message of unity, valor, and the high cost of both war and prejudice.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: Robert Pirosh\n• Screenplay: Robert Pirosh\n• Producer: Dore Schary\n• Music: Alberto Colombo\n• Cinematography: Paul Vogel\n• Distributor: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nStarring:\n• Van Johnson as Lt. Michael Grayson\n• Lane Nakano as Sgt. Sam\n• George Miki as Chick\n• Akira Fukunaga as Kuma\n• Henry Nakamura as Tommy\n• Warner Anderson as Col. Pence\n• Don Haggerty as Sgt. Pete Lewis\n\nFilm Significance:\nGo for Broke! stands out not only as a war drama but as a cultural milestone. It gave visibility to Japanese-American soldiers whose heroism was long overshadowed by the prejudice of internment and wartime suspicion. Many of the supporting actors were actual veterans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, giving the film a level of authenticity rarely seen in Hollywood war films of the time.\n\nThe title itself comes from the Hawaiian gambling slang “go for broke,” meaning to risk everything for a big win — a phrase that captured the spirit of the 442nd’s relentless courage. While the film uses the conventions of 1950s Hollywood storytelling, it remains historically important as both entertainment and a cinematic tribute to minority soldiers who fought for a country that had denied them full rights at home.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
