      "description": "A spaceship crashes on the island of Sardina and the aliens abduct a local scientist and his daughter to help repair it. Leontine Snell, who plays Luisa the scientist's daughter, always moves like a dancer prancing from spot to spot. Filmed in Italy. English subs for when the dialogue switches to Italian.  This is one of those bad movies that moves fast enough to remain entertaining. It contains early examples of the space costumes that would later show up in movies like the Green Slime and the British series UFO.",
