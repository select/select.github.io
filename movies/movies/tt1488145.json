You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation     We have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and contributions of our star Helen Holmes.  \"The Pay Train\" directed by J.P. McGowan from a story by Edward T. Matlack, is a short action drama from a serial by the name of \"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Holmes. This is episode 31 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. The first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson. They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick thinking. Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest ever. Very few of the films survive, and we are happy to  be able to show this rarity to our esteemed viewers. Many of the episodes, including this one, tell about railroad adventures. Hoot Gibson has a modest role as one of the evildoers. He would become one of the luminaries of Western films in the years to come.   Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
