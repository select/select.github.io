Warner, Jacqueline Logan, Dorothy Cumming\n🍕Original Orchestra Score by Hugo Riesenfeld🍕\nIn 1927, working with one of the biggest budgets in Hollywood history and a cast & crew of over 5,000, Cecil B. DeMille brought the life and passion of Christ to the screen in a silent-era supreme spectacle. The opening and resurrection scenes shimmered with the glory of two-strip Technicolor— an early glimpse of cinematic divinity. \n\nPizzaFLIX is proud to present the synchronized sound version of 1928. While there is no spoken dialogue, this edition features special effects and the original orchestra score by Hugo Riesenfeld.\n\nThe awe-inspiring silent epic from legendary director Cecil B. DeMille brings the final weeks of Jesus Christ’s life to the screen with groundbreaking visuals and deeply human storytelling.
