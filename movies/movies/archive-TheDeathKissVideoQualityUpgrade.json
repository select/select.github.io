      "description": "This print is sharper and brighter than the existing IA copy. Plus it is uncropped and in the correct aspect ratio. Murder on a movie set kicks off this entertaining whodunit with good production values and a large cast which reunites David Manners, Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan from the cast of \"Dracula.\" Comedy isn't neglected. An adaptation of the mystery novel by Maldon St. Denis. Directed by Edwin L Marin (debut). Released in 1932. Complete print (re-release). TRIVIA: The original release featured hand-tinted sequences. Three of these brief sequences survived and are in this print. CAST NOTE: George O'Hanlon's screen debut (uncredited).",
