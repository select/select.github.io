      "description": "When reformed thief Boston Blackie stages a Christmas show for inmates at a prison, a wrongly-convicted man uses the opportunity to escape. After a murder is committed, Blackie must exonerate himself by finding both the escapee and the killer. #3 of 14 \"Boston Blackie\" films released between 1941 and 1949. Chester Morris as Horatio \"Boston Blackie\" Black Adele Mara as Eve Sanders Richard Lane as Inspector Farraday George E. Stone as The Runt Lloyd Corrigan as Arthur Manleder Walter Sande as Detective Mathews Larry Parks as Joe Trilby George McKay as Roggi McKay Cy Kendall as Jumbo Madigan Paul Fix as Steve Caveroni I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
