    "Plot": "Scrappy and his mongrel try to sneak into a dog show. Because it is for purebreds only, a guard keeps throwing them out.The humor in this one is almost entirely puns on the names of the various breeds. Thus, the Doberman Pinschers keep pinching each other's cheeks. If you enjoy this sort of humor, you'll enjoy this cartoon.Mel Blanc is listed on the IMDB as the (uncredited) voice of Scrappy. Given that Scrappy doesn't have any lines, this seems odd.",
