      "description": "Western epic about the historic battle of 1836. By and with John Wayne . The defense of Fort Alamo against Mexican superiority in the Texan War of Independence in 1836 by 185 volunteers, down to the last man. A monumental war film with questionable hero worship: Decorative images celebrate a questionable admiration of courage in the face of death and leadership.   Cinematically, the production impresses with its effort and pacing, as well as its emotional staging.",
