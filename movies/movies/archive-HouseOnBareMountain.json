      "description": "Frank Henenlotter once wrote that nudie cuties were \"undoubtedly the stupidest films on the face of the earth\", and this movie provides ample evidence in support of that, though it is by no means the stupidest nudie cutie ever made. Before reading this description, please understand that any attempt to put the \"plot\" into words makes it more coherent than it actually is. That's just what happens with a movie shot in three days, two of which were mostly ad-libbed. Lovable Bob Cresse (that's how he's billed in the credits!) plays Granny Good, headmistress and owner of Granny Good's Finishing School for Girls. She also runs an illegal still, which a 7 foot tall wolfman helps her operate. The police place an undercover agent in the school as a student, a Fed-looking guy starts snooping around as well, and everything climaxes during a party being given to cover the shipping of the moonshine to the unlicensed distributors. Also, a cut-rate Dracula and a guy in a really obvious Frankenstein's monster mask turn up at the party, in addition to the wolfman. None of that matters, because the main reason for watching this movie is to enjoy all the bare breasts on display (pretty much all of them worth looking at), and to laugh and/or groan at the cornball humor. That said, the movie comes off as sweetly innocent and amusing, rather than crass or dull. This film was published without copyright notice, which, under the copyright law in effect at the time, put it directly into the public domain.",
