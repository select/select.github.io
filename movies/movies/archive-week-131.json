      "description": "Ho, Ho - Hello and welcome back to everyone's favorite festive film vault of fun. This week, since the world is still toiling in the grip of Covid-19 during these holiday times, we thought we would try and take your minds off your fears with a bit of cinema craziness aimed at our younger set of patrons. First up, after a few Stooge coming attractions and a vintage holiday short, we bring you \"Little Red Riding Hood And The Monsters\"; a strange 1962 Mexican masterpiece that some may consider more torment that entertainment for kids. Then, after an intermission that features a \"newer\" holiday cartoon, we finish up with 1962's \"The Magic Sword\"; a Bert I. Gordon wonder that features Basil Rathbone as an evil sorcerer. So, grab the littles ones, load them up with candy, and get ready for some outrageous torture with at least one of the strangest kids' movie ever unloaded on an unsuspecting public. Happy Holidays and let's hope for a much calmer New Year. Don't forget w e also have an APP and a website.
