The book defines a generation, and touches many hearts... but what many don't know is that Susannah's Wake is a novel plagued by accusations of plagiarism. The man behind these claims: a struggling author named Gordon Gary Ross. Ross' obsession with Swan triggers a whirlwind of revenge, blackmail and violence thatnearly brings Montreal's literary community to its knees, and ultimately leads to a shocking and brutal act of violence.",
