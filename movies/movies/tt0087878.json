      "description": "The heroes of the film - an astrophysicist, a locksmith, a salesman, an architect, a loader, a trolleybus driver - are called up for military training, which ends ahead of time. There is a strange pause in their life - no one knows where they are, no one is waiting for them, and they themselves can not rush anywhere. This short respite in a hurried and hectic life gives the heroes the opportunity to experience strong and very important feelings for them.\n\nIMDb rating: 7.0\n\nYear of production: 1984\n\nDirector: Vadim Abdrashitov\nScreenwriter: Mindadze Alexander\nComposer: Ganelin Vyacheslav\nCinematographer: Vladimir Shevcik\nArtist-director: Alexander Tolkachev\n\nСast: Sergey Shakurov, Sergey Nikonenko, Oleg Borisov, Alexey Zharkov, Peter Zaichenko, Alexander Pashutin, Boris Romanov, Boris Smorchkov, Marina Shimanskaya, Galina Shostko, Elena Mayorova, Nevolina Angelika",
