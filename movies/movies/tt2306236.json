Rebecca White fails to book her a fast flight or a decent hotel. Rude as ever, kind only to her equally spoiled dog, complaining to the noisy neighbors this time gets her abducted, first as nasty witness, after identification as valuable prize, by Vlad's bunch of Russian white slavers, who tricked some local girls there, supposedly for an East European contest with a shot at a modeling career. When Rebbecca misses her, the company sends a ranking executive and enlists the FBI, but only the P.A. can make sense of a cryptic clue in her recorded ransom message.",
