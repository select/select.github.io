      "description": "From the Depths of the Earth, He Will Rise..\nProfessor Morlant, a nefarious Egyptologist, seeks immortality through the power of a jewel buried in the tomb of an Egyptian idol. Upon his death, a group of opportunistic thieves converges on his estate, & the deceased Morlant rises to exact revenge on those who have violated his tomb, unleashing terror on all who cross his path. With a web of deceit and treachery woven around the coveted jewel, the once-dead professor emerges to confront those who seek to exploit his legacy, setting the stage for a chilling battle between the living and the vengeful dead.\n\nOriginal title: The Ghoul (1933)\n\nBlack & White version: https://youtu.be/YY9pwGTk6n8\n\n\nDirector: T.
