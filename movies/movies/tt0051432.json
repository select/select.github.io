      "description": "This could be considered a rip off of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956) and Roger Corman's \"It Conquered the World,\" except for something you will only discover by watching it, and it is worth watching. This is a surprisingly good little drive-in sci fi flick considering the extreme limitations of its $30,000 budget. Directed by Bruno VeSota. Released in 1958. a.k.a. \"Keepers of the Earth\" \"The Keepers\" \"The Brain Snatchers\" Complete print. CAST NOTES: Although Joanna Lee had a successful career as a screen writer and producer she is mostly remembered for her role as the alien, Tanna, in \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\" Leonard Nimoy is billed as Leonard Nemoy.",
