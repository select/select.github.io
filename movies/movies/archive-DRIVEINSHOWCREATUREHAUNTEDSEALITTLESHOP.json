To make your dvd, download the zipped folder, open it extract the VIDEO_TS folder, then burn the VIDEO TS folder on a disc and you're done. Just take the disc into the player, grab soda, candy, chips, and a beer or two, and watch! I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site.
