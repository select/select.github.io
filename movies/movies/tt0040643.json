      "description": "\"Night Has a Thousand Eyes\" is a 1948 horror film directed by John Farrow , featuring a star-studded cast including Edward G. Robinson , Gail Russell , and John Lund . Based on Cornell Woolrich's novel, the film blends elements of film noir with supernatural themes.  The film opens with Elliott Carson (played by John Lund ) preventing his girlfriend Jean Courtland (played by Gail Russell ) from committing suicide by jumping in front of a train. Their troubled relationship takes a turn when they meet John Triton (played by Edward G. Robinson ), a former psychic who claims to have the ability to predict future events. John recounts his past experiences with clairvoyance, revealing that he foresaw tragedies, including the death of Jean's father, Whitney Courtland . Despite efforts to avert disaster, Triton's attempts seem to lead to more turmoil, creating a tense atmosphere as Jean becomes increasingly anxious about her fate. With feelings of fear mounting, she becomes more reliant on John's prophecies, raising questions about fate, free will, and the nature of clairvoyance.",
