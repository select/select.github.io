      "description": "Good evening and welcome back to everyone's favorite auditorium for alien fun and out of this world wonder. Well, with summer winding down, we thought we could help signal the end of the season with three late 50s science fiction flicks guaranteed to chill things down with just the right amount of cheese. First up, after a few coming attractions, we begin the fun with \"Missile To The Moon\", a 1958 low budget remake of  \"Cat-Women Of The Moon\". Then, we continue with 1958's \"The Lost Missile\" about some \"alien\" rocket destroying things here on earth. Finally, we close out the triple treat with 1959's \"The Cosmic Man\" featuring John Carradine as a misunderstood alien visitor preaching peace. So, grab your favorite soft drink and snack, then sit back and enjoy all the drive in fun brought to you by a bit of stock footage and cheap alien fun.
