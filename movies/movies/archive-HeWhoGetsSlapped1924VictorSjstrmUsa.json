      "description": "He Who Gets Slapped is a 1924 film starring Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, and John Gilbert.[1][2] It was directed by Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m. The film is based on the Russian play Ð¢Ð¾Ñ, ÐºÑÐ¾ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐ°ÐµÑ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ¸Ð½Ñ (\"He Who Gets Slapped\", transliterated as Tot, kto poluchayet poshchechini) by playwright Leonid Andreyev, which was published in 1914 and in English, as He Who Gets Slapped, in 1922. The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916. The film is significant for many reasons, foremost being that it was the first production to start filming in the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the release was postponed until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The film was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. This film was also the first to feature Leo the Lion as the mascot MGM logo. Leo the Lion first appeared in the logo for Goldwyn Pictures Corporation in 1917, and the logo passed to MGM when the companies merged. The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and SjÃ¶strÃ¶m. Some sources claim that BÃ©la Lugosi plays the uncredited role of a clown, although this is based solely on the resemblance of a particular actor to Lugosi. Director: Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m Writers: Leonid Andreyev (play), Carey Wilson (adapted for the screen by) Stars: Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer and John Gilbert",
