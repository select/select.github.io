      "description": "Billy the Kid (Buster Crabbe) and Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) are on the run from riders who hope to cash in on the reward money for their capture. They agree to join a cattle drive to the railroad junction, but rustlers stampede the herd so they can buy what's left at a discount. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
