    "Plot": "A witless waiter working in a hotel restaurant often causes problems for the other staff members of the restaurant, his manager, and the customers. One day, an inventor and his associate dine in the restaurant and is served by the waiter. Gaining access via a submarine moored offshore with its ready crew, the inventor and his associate plan to rob a passenger steamer of a large shipment of gold on board. As they seem so secretive, the waiter devises a system of listening in on their conversation without being detected. As such, the waiter learns their plans to rob the steamer. Using a naval disguise, the waiter plans to take their place first on the submarine so that he can rob the steamer himself. Even with the help of the submarine's crew - or in spite of it - the waiter finds that stealing the gold and getting away scot-free isn't as straightforward as he anticipated.",
