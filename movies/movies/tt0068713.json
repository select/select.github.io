It stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, with Alberto de Mendoza, Silvia Tortosa, Julio Peña, George Rigaud, Ángel del Pozo, and Telly Savalas in supporting roles. Set in 1906, a British anthropologist named Professor Sir Alexander Saxton discovers a frozen humanoid in Manchuria and transports it on the Trans-Siberian Express. As the creature thaws, it reveals itself to be a parasitic alien that absorbs the memories of its victims, leading to a series of murders aboard the train, while Saxton and his rival, Dr. Wells, race to stop the creature before it claims more lives.",
