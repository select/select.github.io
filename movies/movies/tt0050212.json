It tells the story of British prisoners of war forced to build a railway bridge for their Japanese captors in World War II.The film centers on Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, who is determined to uphold the honor of the British Army even under harsh conditions. He and his men are tasked with constructing a bridge over the River Kwai in Burma, which will serve as part of a Japanese supply route. The story explores themes of duty, honor, and the morality of war, and has become a benchmark in war movies, known for its iconic scenes, especially the construction of the bridge and the haunting theme music.

Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge, but under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson they're persuaded the bridge should be built to help morale, spirit. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of Japanese Commandant Colonel Saito, but soon they realise it's a monument to Nicholson, himself, as well as a form of collaboration with the enemy.",
