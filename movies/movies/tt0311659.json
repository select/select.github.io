On May 1971, authorities found 25 mutilated bodies of male, middle aged farmworkers along the Feather River in Sutter County. Many of the victims followed the orchid harvests to seek work and  lived along Marysville. Police recovered a Machete and other sharp objects at the labor camp he supervised, where he hired many of the man he eventually killed. He had been institutionalized prior to the murders in 1955. Corona was tried in Colusa County and found guilty in January 1973. He won a new trial five years. On 1982, he had been tried for all 25 murders. Authorities have said over the years his body count could be higher.
