      "description": "Highly interesting footage of the French town of Verdun in 1918. Verdun is well-known for one of the bloodiest battles during World War I which took place between 21 februari and 20 December 1916. It was at the heart of German attemps to force a breach though the Western front, but it can be concluded that they never achieved their objectives. The strategies, tactics and events on both the French and German side can be read in great detail in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun Close to 360,000 soldiers on the French side and 340,000 on German side lost their lives during this battle. It is hard to tell which side won the battle, among other due to the war continuing elsewhere in France e.g. in the Battle of the Somme in which also the British participated. The film shows panoramic views of the countryside near Verdun. US General James W. McAndrew and US Secretary of War Newton D. Baker observe the fire of artillery pieces. 26th Division troops view the ruins in Verdun: railroad yards, churches, and train stations. French President Raymond Poincaré arrives and reviews the French troops. The splended shot of Verdun Castle at 04:28 almost seems to have been filmed in the Middle Ages. There will be more heavily restored and colorized footage about WW-I on this channel soon. Do tell us what you think of this! Our well-filled box of software tools, including Artificial Intelligence tools has been let lose on the original very poor quality B&W footage. Please do not expect the same quality as with most of our other uploads. Please note that, although this film involves WW-I, no combat scenes nor human sufferings are shown. The film mainly focusses on the huge damage to the town of Verdun and soldiers and officers occupying their positions. Source: US National Archive. Music: Hampus Naeselius - The Thin Line and Trevor Kowalski - All A Beautiful Blur.",
