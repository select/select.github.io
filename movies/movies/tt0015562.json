    "Plot": "Alice and Julius are going to stage a bullfight. Their bull is a broken-down old cow. They fix it up with some rollerskates. A family of cats uses a see-saw to catapult themselves over the fence; a cop (dog) spots them, but ends up helping them by accident. Julius replaces the bull with a more presentable one from a tobacco billboard for the introduction to the crowd. Alice fights the sad cow, sending her into a cactus; this makes her mad enough to really fight. Time for another swap: Julius dresses as a pantomime cow, and Alice throws him across the ring...",
