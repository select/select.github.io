    "Plot": "The crowd packs into the theater to see the adorable and sexy Betty Boop, but first they must endure a Paramount Noose Reel, which features a tediously speechifying mayor and a disastrously silly christening of a ship. Next, they're subjected to a cartoon with Bimbo and Koko the Clown, who perform a hoary old blackout gag. Finally, the screen goes dark and Betty Boop appears on stage to wow the audience with her songs and her imitations of Fanny Brice and Maurice Chevalier. Everyone enjoys the show, except an elephant, who makes an ill-advised attempt to steal peanuts from a baby, and the baby himself, who is unable to see over a man's tall hat - or his tall head. Betty is such a hit that no one is interested in the acrobats that follow her. The unfortunate performers are stuck in a human pyramid as Betty takes bow after bow.",
