      "description": "“Splendidly exceptional” “Solid thriller with a great concept” “Surprisingly fun” “Delightful mystery” “A neglected masterpiece” (IMDB reviews quotes). This print is sharper, cleaner and with better contrast than the existing IA copy. A truly unique mystery that’s well-produced and fun thanks to skillful direction, David Lean’s tight editing and a solid all-British cast. Pre-code. In another year the bedroom scene wouldn’t have gotten past the US censors. Recommended. IMDB rating 6.3. Directed by Bernard Vorhaus. Released in 1933 (UK). Complete Print (PAL transfer) CAST NOTE: Ida Lupino’s fifth credited screen role. TRIVIA: First US telecast January 16, 1949 on Boston’s WBZ channel 4. ",
