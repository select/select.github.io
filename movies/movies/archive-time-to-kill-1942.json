      "description": "A private detective is hired to retrieve a valuable antique coin that was stolen from an old dowager to pay off a blackmailer. The private eye soon finds himself up to his ears in cover-ups, fights, more blackmail, a timid secretary, hysterical women and murder. This is the first in a series of movies about private detective Michael Shayne, a character created by Brett Halliday, but the story is actually based on Raymond Chandler's novel \"The High Window\". Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne Heather Angel as Myrle Davis Doris Merrick as Linda Conquest Murdock Ralph Byrd as Lou Venter Richard Lane as Lt. Breeze Sheila Bromley as Lois Morny Morris Ankrum as Alexander Morny Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Murdock I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it makes thing look more natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
