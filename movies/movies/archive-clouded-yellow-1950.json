      "description": "A former British secret agent, who has gotten a quiet job cataloguing butterfies for the Fentons at their country estate, falls in love with their niece. So when she is framed for the murder of their groundskeeper, he helps her escape by using the skills and contacts from his years as a spy. They are hotly pursued by both the police and the real murderer. Jean Simmons as Sophie Malraux Trevor Howard as Maj. David Somers Sonia Dresdel as Jess Fenton Barry Jones as Nicholas Fenton Kenneth More as Willy Shepley Geoffrey Keen as Police Inspector André Morell as Secret Service Chief Chubb I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
