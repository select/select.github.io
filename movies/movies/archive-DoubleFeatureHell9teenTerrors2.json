      "description": "Those crazy kids are back. The 2am Theater management asserts no video editors were harmed in gluing together this double feature presentation. The post-pubescent adventures begin with previews of coming attractions, followed by the first feature presentation in which teens are on the menu for \"The Giant Gila Monster.\" Then young Republicans have a wild night in the short subject, \"What Makes a Good Party?\" The second feature presentation is \"The Beach Girls and the Monster,\" in which beach bunnies are attacked by one of the worst monster costumes in the long, hilarious history of really bad monster costumes. (DO NOT PARK YOUR BUBBLE GUM UNDER THE SEATS!)",
