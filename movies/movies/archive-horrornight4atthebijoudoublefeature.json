      "description": "The 2am Theater returns with another pair of Italian horror classics. The night of dark shadows begins with the usual gruesome previews of horrors to come. Then former sword and sandal queen Rosanna Podesta is threatened by an insane killer in “The Virgin of Nuremberg” (AKA “Horror Castle”). Next Babs is back in the reconstructed print of “Terror-Creatures from the Grave,” where spirits of the dead have sadistic murders on their minds. (And a good time was had by all.)",
