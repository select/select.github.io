      "description": "An out-of-work pulp fiction novelist arrives in shadowy post-war Vienna, divided into sectors by the victorious allies, where a shortage of supplies has led to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident. As he talks to Lime's friends and associates, he finds that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. written by Graham Greene directed by Carol Reed      Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins Alida Valli as Anna Schmidt Orson Welles as Harry Lime Trevor Howard as Maj. Calloway Paul Hörbiger as Karl Ernst Deutsch as Baron Kurtz Erich Ponto as Dr. Winkel Bernard Lee as Sgt. Paine Wilfrid Hyde-White as Crabbin I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
