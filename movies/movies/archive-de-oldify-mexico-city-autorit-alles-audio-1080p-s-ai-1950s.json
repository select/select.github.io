      "description": "Stunning film footage of Mexico City and nearby places, filmed towards the end of the 1940s or at the beginning of the 1950s. The film shows great views of the Plaza de la Costitutión, Zocaló and its Metropolitana cathedral in Mexico City, other beautiful buildings like the Palacio de Bellas Artes as well as a number of car journeys through the city and beyond. The original film has been motion-stabilized, enhanced and colorized by means of state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence software. It is based on raw footage, probably intended for a movie or documentary. We have deliberately chosen not to cut or edit each scene, so some parts of Mexico come into view for a longer period. You can skip scenes if they seem too long to your liking. For reasons of copyright, the Mexican style background music is by contemporary artists, so not from the 1950s. Music: Mexican music by various contemporary artists Source: archive.org. Time line (please help to complete this): 00:00 Mexico City: Plaza Major.",
