      "description": "On the Waterfront is a 1954 American  crime drama  film, directed by  Elia Kazan  and written by  Budd Schulberg . It stars  Marlon Brando , and features  Karl Malden ,  Lee J. Cobb ,  Rod Steiger ,  Pat Henning  and  Eva Marie Saint  in her film debut. The musical score was composed by  Leonard Bernstein . The black-and-white film was inspired by \"Crime on the Waterfront\" by  Malcolm Johnson , a series of articles published in November–December 1948 in the  New York Sun  which won the 1949  Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting , but the screenplay by  Budd Schulberg  is directly based on his own original story. The film focuses on union violence and corruption among  longshoremen , while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of  Hoboken, New Jersey . On the Waterfront was a critical and commercial success and is considered  one of the greatest films ever made . It received twelve  Academy Award  nominations and won eight, including  Best Picture ,  Best Actor  for Brando,  Best Supporting Actress  for Saint, and  Best Director  for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the  American Film Institute  as  the eighth-greatest American movie of all time ; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.",
