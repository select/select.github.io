Robert Clarke as Maj. William Allison Darlene Tompkins as Princess Trirene Arianne Ulmer as Capt. Markova Vladimir Sokoloff as The Supreme Stephen Bekassy as Gen. Karl Kruse John Van Dreelen as Dr. Bourman I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. For questions or general comments, please use the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum",
