    "Plot": "An elderly couple reminisce before a fire. The old man gets out their photo album. Through an old stereo viewer, they revisit their shared past, beginning as toddlers in the 1870s and leading up to their wedding and kids. A medley of popular late 19th-century and early 20th-century songs accompanies the couple's memories of their youth and courtship. The couple, in flat painted backgrounds, look through the stereoscope at animation with 3-D backgrounds. In the end, the couple are revealed to be 3-D figures themselves, living in a quaint nostalgia nook in a vast 3-D mansion with beautiful Art Deco styling.",
