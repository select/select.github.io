      "description": "In keeping with the season in the US (and maybe in the UK) the 2am Theater presents two lively political comedies -- one from each side of the Atlantic. First up are previews of coming attractions followed by a cartoon. Then a Scottish bi-election literally goes to the dogs in “Storm in a Teacup,” costarring Rex Harrison and Vivien Leigh. Next in “The Dark Horse,” desperate for a suitable candidate a deadlocked party convention  nominates a political novice who later turns out to be one of the dumbest humans on the planet. (Kinda like in our last presidential election.) Warren William and Bette Davis costar. Both laughers have excellent supporting casts and A-feature production values. ",
