    "Plot": "The slight plot, in what little time it is actually on screen, has ranch hand Ted Duncan in love with the daughter, Mary Martin of ranch owner Martin. But Cooper, neighboring rancher has his eye on Mary and everything else Martin owns so, at the annual relay races, Martin is goaded into a lock-stock-and-barrel bet that his horse, ridden by Ted, can beat Cooper's horse. Cooper has no intention of running an honest race.The majority of the film is mostly a showcase for Abe Lyman and his band and a slew of what-killed-vaudeville acts, most featuring pint-sized Mona Ray (as another Martin daughter only to have an excuse to work her into the film.) There are seven songs,some acts and turns, and an exhibition of roping and riding by two young brothers, Tom and Hank MacFarland, a couple of kids primarily from the rodeo circuit. Some of the stuff from Mona Ray is... well... sort of disturbing.",
