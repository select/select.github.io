    "Plot": "In the 8th film of the 22-film series, Texas Rangers Tex Wyatt, Jim Steele and Panhandle Perkins are sent to the district of Rawhide to investigate the killings of several ranchers. Tex enters the town posing as a tramp while the other two Rangers join a troupe of itinerant minstrels. Tex, convinced that while they may find the killer, it will not prevent further harassment of the poorer ranchers, and he returns to the Ranger station and persuades his father, Texas Ranger Captain John Wyatt, to take a leave of absence and go to Rawhide and run for Land Commissioner. Tex and his father meet Henry Colby, the wealthiest landholder in the district, who has been advised by his ranch foreman, Frank Hade, and Sam Barrett, the boss of Rawhide, that the nesters are the cause of all the lawlessness. At a meeting, preceded by the dullest, most demeaning minstrel show ever filmed, Captain Wyatt is shot (a fate that should have befallen the minstrels) and the bullet is found to be the same caliber as that used in the earlier killings, although Wyatt is only wounded. Mary Colby, riding the range, sees Barrett attempt to kill Tex using a rifle. Realizing he has been identified, Barrett hurries back to town where he meets the other gang members, and they prepare to fight against the Rangers.",
