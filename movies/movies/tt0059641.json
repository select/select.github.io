    "Plot": "The story of three racing drivers and three women, who constantly have to worry for the lives of their boyfriends. Jim Loomis and Mike Marsh drive for Pat Cassarian. Jim expects his fiancée Holly, but before she arrives, he dies in a race. Since she doesn't have the money to travel back, she stays. The young and very ambitious talent Ned Arp joins the team, and immediately starts wooing Pat's sister Julie. Third on the team is womanizer Dan McCall, who brings with him his current girlfriend Gabrielle from Paris. So the basic theme of this movie is, \"Whom with whom?\"",
