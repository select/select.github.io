      "description": "A woman who is notorious on the China coast takes a train through an area where a dangerous civil war is raging. On board she encounters a British Army doctor she had been in love with 5 years earlier. But their reunion is short-lived when Chinese guerrillas stop the train and select him as their hostage. Marlene Dietrich as Shanghai Lily Clive Brook as Captain Donald Harvey Anna May Wong as Hui Fei Warner Oland as Henry Chang Eugene Pallette as Sam Salt Lawrence Grant as Mr. Carmichael Louise Closser Hale as Mrs. Haggerty Gustav von Seyffertitz as Eric Baum Emile Chautard as Major Lenard If you have a request or a comment for me, please go to the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
