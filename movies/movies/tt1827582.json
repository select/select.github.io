    "Plot": "\"Walt Roesner and the Capitolians\" is a fair sound short from MGM, though it is in far grainier condition than normal. The band play a variety of songs and were at their best when there was no soloist and the just played jazz with no soloist. Before and after that, however, you need to suffer though a few songs such as their rendition of \"O Solo Mio\"...which might be if okay if you like that operatic style (which I don't). Apart from it being a relatively early Vitaphone sound film, there's not much to distinguish it apart from seeing that one of the band members is Jimmy Dorsey on the sax as well as a super-bizarre but interesting violin solos you simply need to see to believe.By the way, perhaps I am wrong, but it would appear that some of the band members are wearing makeup and even eyeliner in a few cases.",
