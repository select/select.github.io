    "Plot": "Pluto sees the great chow the mascots at the army base are getting and decides he wants some of that. He sneaks in and disguises himself as Gunther Goat, but the \"food\" is just a bunch of tin cans. Gunther runs him off. Later, Gunther chews on some tobacco, so Pluto does the same, which impresses the GIs but Gunther butts him and makes him swallow it, making Pluto turn all kinds of colors. While Pluto is out, Gunther prepares to butt him into the ammo dump, but Pluto collapses and Gunther himself gets blown sky high, clearing the way for a new mascot.",
