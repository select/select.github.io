    "Plot": "Manny Gould and Ben Harrison had been producing the Krazy Kat cartoons since the middle of the previous decade. Even though their efforts bore no relation to the famed comic strip, they certainly knew how to direct a cartoon, and this is an example of that easy virtuosity.The arc of the story is summed up in the title, and the directors, along with animators Al Eugster and Preston Blair loaded this with a lot of gags; all the standard cartoon gags of the era, with transformations and high-stepping characters cake-walking to jazzy versions of popular songs of the era. It's one of those comedy shorts that is a catalogue of gags, related and unrelated; if you don't find this one is funny, wait another second and a half and you'll get another.",
