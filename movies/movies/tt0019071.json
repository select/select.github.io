      "description": "Emil Jannings won the first best actor Academy Award for his performance as a sympathetic tyrant: an exiled Russian general turned Hollywood extra who lands a role playing a version of his former tsarist self, bringing about his emotional downfall. Josef von Sternberg’s   The Last Command  is a brilliantly realized silent melodrama and a witty send-up of the Hollywood machine, featuring virtuoso cinematography, grandly designed sets and effects, and rousing Russian Revolution sequences. Towering above it all is the passionate, heartbreaking Jannings, whose portrayal of a man losing his grip on reality is one for the history books.",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Emil Jannings won the very first Academy Award for best actor in this romantic drama, while it was also nominated for best writing. It has been critically respected as one of the finest silent films since its release, it was also unfortunately a commercial flop. It is based on the true story of Theodore Lodi, although most details have been drastically changed. ",
