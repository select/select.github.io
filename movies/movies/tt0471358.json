    "Plot": "These strikingly sharp scenes from Belfast present familiar thoroughfares including Bedford Street and Donegall Place. Fashionable residents peruse upmarket shops and we also glimpse passing horse-drawn transport to the Ormeau and Malone Roads. The film appeared as part of a show at the Ulster Hall in May 1901 and billboards advertising the event appear in shots of Royal Avenue.",
