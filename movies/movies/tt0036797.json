    "Plot": "This is one of the titles currently released on DVD by PTM Entertainment in a beautiful picture quality which is common to their series of Johannes Heesters movies - probably to celebrate his 100th (!) birthday, which will take place late in 2003. This film is one of the best, perhaps because of the good chemistry between Heesters and his leading lady Lizzy Waldmüller, who's fate it was to be killed soon after the film was finished during an air raid on Vienna. Definitely not an important film, but an acceptable parlour comedy with beautiful tunes by Peter Kreuder.",
