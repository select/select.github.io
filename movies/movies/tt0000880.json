Griffith.  We have a whole constellation of our stars taking part in this film: Billy Bitzer, Arthur V. Johnson, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence. Billy Bitzer shares the cinematography credit with Arthur Marvin. Arthur V. Johnson plays a policeman, Robert Harron is a messenger and Florence Lawrence is the first daughter. D.W. Griffith gets an acting credit as well, apart from the director's job. He is somewhere in the ball scene, but it is difficult to spot him. When their father leaves for business, Florence Lawrence and her sister become the victims of two consecutive, but separate burglaries. Ironically, when they seek help to counter the second more violent criminal, the only person available is the first thief.   Directed by                       D.W.
