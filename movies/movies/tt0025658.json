      "description": "“Creaky quota quickie” (IMDB review quote). I agree with the IMDB reviewer. This musty crime melodrama creaks like a rusty gate hinge. Nevertheless it’s not without points of interest, especially if you’re curious about what the British equivalent of Mascot Pictures and Tiffany Productions were cranking out in the early ‘30s. IMDB rating 5.0. Adapted and directed by George Pearson. Released in 1933 (UK only). Complete print ?",
