    "Plot": "A district attorney is investigating a utility company's directors for fraud. He gets a call about some incriminating evidence, but it's a ploy to lure him to an apartment where he is gunned down. To make the shooting seem less like an effort to suppress the investigation, it's made it look like the district attorney was keeping a jealous mistress. Andy Terrell, his wisecracking newspaperman friend, is networked with practically everyone and gets curious. Things get complicated for the utility company directors because Lionel Houston, now the new district attorney, is dating Diane Cromwell, the daughter of utility director Grover Cromwell. Andy uses his connections in low places to ferret out information but runs afoul of the king-pin Bruno by dallying with his lady. The utility directors were using their purloined funds to gamble in other stocks. Suddenly, they have no funds left plus cooked books. One tells Grover that he knows how to get his hands on $1M in gold bullion. He thinks he has talked Grover into fleeing with him, but Grover decides to arrange for a train/car accident so that his insurance will provide for his daughter. Lionel is lured by Bruno to a meeting but brings reinforcements.",
