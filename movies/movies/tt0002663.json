      "description": "  This gem is presented by Silent Hall of Fame.   Please visit https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/   to support our non-profit mission and the legacy of silent movie stars by making a tax deductible contribution.   FEEL FREE TO FOLLOW US ON TWITTER @SilentFilmGems   \"Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life\" is a short comedy. The film is included in our program to illustrate the contributions of our star Helen Holmes. Barney Oldfield was the fastest auto racer in his time. In the film he chases an engine to rescue a girl chained to the tracks by an evil unsuccessful suitor.  The way Ford Sterling overplays the role of the villain makes one think that the film was conceived as a parody of contemporary melodramas. This is one of the first roles of Helen Holmes, in which she plays a village beauty. She became the audacious star of \"The Hazards of Helen\" a year and a half later, acting as the heroine of numerous railroad adventures. She may have gotten inspiration from \"Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life\" and the race to save Mabel Normand. Directed by                Mack Sennett Produced by              Keystone Film Company Starring                     Mack Sennett, Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Barney Oldfield, Helen Holmes Cinematography        Lee Bartholomew, Walter Wright Distributed by           Mutual Film Corporation Release date               June 3, 1913 Running time             13 min.
