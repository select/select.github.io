      "description": "An eccentric historian and his wife live in an isolated castle-like mansion in the Mojave Desert. When a guest suddenly collapses, Charlie Chan is invited to investigate and deterines that he was poisoned. Then all communication with the outside world is sabotaged, and the murderer is free to strike again. Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan Arleen Whelan as Brenda Hartford Richard Derr as Carl Detheridge Douglass Dumbrille as Paul Manderley Henry Daniell as Watson King Edmund MacDonald as Walter Hartford Victor Sen Yung as Jimmy Chan Lenita Lane as Lucy Manderley Ethel Griffies as Madame Saturnia Milton Parsons as Arthur Fletcher Steven Geray as Dr. Retling Lucien Littlefield as Gleason I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
