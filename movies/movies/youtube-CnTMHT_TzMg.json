      "description": "Different people search for different reason for \"The Green Goddess\", the Guatemalan idol. A friend of Tarzan, D'Arnot, has crashed in Guatemala and is now held by a jungle tribe. Two other expeditions, one lead by Major Martling and one by Ula Vale whose fiance died in an earlier one, are looking for the valuable idol, too. Raglan, Ula's lawyer, is searching as well, but only to keep it to himself. Tarzan, Ula and Major Martling rescue D'Arnot and find the idol that is worhiped by the natives. More adventures follow through the jungle of losing and recapturing the idol.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Edward Kull and Wilbur F. McGaugh, produced by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ashton Dearholt and George W.
