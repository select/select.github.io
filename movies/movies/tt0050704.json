      "description": "The Midnight Story is a 1957 American CinemaScope FILM NOlR crime film directed by Joseph Pevney and starring Tony Curtis, Marisa Pavan and Gilbert Roland. The Midnight Story is one of those movies that demonstrates that Curtis could really act. He always felt that he had the makings of a “real” actor, and a good one, but producers preferred not to take risks and kept casting him in lightweight rôles (which he happened to be very good at).   You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and  D for Doom and Cereal at Midnight .  ",
