      "description": "Lash LaRue and his partner Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) are sent for by Jim Thornton, who has found gold. But when they arrive they find him dead, survived by a daughter (Peggy Stewart). Lash knows that Conway (John Cason) is involved but that Conway is not the boss of the gang. Lash suspects who it is, and sets a trap to flush the villain out. Written by Ron Ormond and Ira Webb Directed by Ray Taylor I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
