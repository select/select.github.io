    "Plot": "Bosko is a soda jerk (in more ways than one), happily whistling as he makes ice cream sodas. Bosko serves a mouse such a big soda that the only way the mouse can reach the straw is to spin his stool as high as it will go. Good service. But later, Bosko breaks his mixer and, by twisting the rodent's tail to make his head turn around, uses the mouse customer as a replacement. Bosko's former schoolteacher comes in for a soda. She's enjoying the rotating electric fan; but when Bosko puts the ice cream soda on the counter, the fan blows it in her face. Bosko only laughs at her. Honey calls and asks Bosko to bring an ice cream cone for her bratty kitten pupil. The delivery proves to be more of a trial than Bosko had expected.",
