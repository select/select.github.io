      "description": "The Girl And Her Trust directed by D W Griffith in 1912. It is a remake of an earlier film, The Lonedale Operator but by this time Griffith had learned a great deal about the making of movies. The picture has close-ups, and ironic cutting. Te see the words, \"Nothing ever happens here\" and then cut to the tramps under the platform. But toward the end he cuts between a train and a hand car and to build suspense he actually mounts the camera on a vehicle racing along the road and on the hand cart itself. The music on the films I took from and archive area called 20's jazz.",
