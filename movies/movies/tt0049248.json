      "description": "“One of a kind” “A head shaker and a mind melter” “What did I just see?” (IMDB reviews quotes). Off-the-wall British science fiction that’s a strange mix of mystery, social commentary, the red scare and comedy. The real mystery is how Paul Douglas was roped into staring. Well maybe he wanted a free trip to Austria. The supporting cast and production values are good enough to make this curiosity worth watching for dedicated ‘50s sci-fi fans. IMDB rating 5.3. Directed by John Gilling. Released in 1956. Complete print.",
