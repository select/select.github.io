When Michael's wife Elaine (Dorothy Fay) fails to return after visiting Abel, her sister Valarie Howett (Iris Meredith), accompanied by her father Parker Howett (Forrest Taylor) and private detective Spike Holland (Victor Jory), rent an adjoining estate, determined to investigate the case. After learning that Valarie, her father, and Spike are in the vicinity, Abel is afraid they will discover his association with a gang of jewel thieves and desperately tries to have then all killed. Each attempt, however, is thwarted by the Green Archer, who mysteriously appears with his deadly bow-and-arrows whenever needed. Fighting fire with fire, Abel has one of his henchmen, Brad (Jack Ingram), impersonate the Green Archer..",
