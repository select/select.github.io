      "description": "The telephone-operator girlfriend (Janet Munro) of a disgraced newspaper reporter (Edward Judd) overhears confirmation that the testing of atomic bombs by the U.S. and Russia at the same time has altered the Earth's axial tilt, which is causing increasingly catatrophic worldwide climate change. He and the paper's science reporter (Leo McKern) expose the government cover-up and then report on the plan for a possible solution. Directed by Val Guest Widescreen I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
