      "description": "An elaborate depiction of the failure of English colonial policy in Sudan; General Gordon defends the capital Khartoum in vain against the Mahdi's \"holy war.\"   An adventure film that entertains with plenty of fighting, some sentimental episodes, and magnificent landscape shots of the Nile, but oversimplifies the political background.",

It does not want to commit a British military force to a foreign war, but they have a commitment to protect the Egyptians in Khartoum. They decide to ask General Charles \"Chinese\" Gordon (Charlton Heston), something of a folk hero in the Sudan, as he had cleared the area of the slave trade, to arrange for the evacuation. Gordon agrees, but also decides to defend the city against the forces of Mohammed Ahmed el Mahdi (Sir Laurence Olivier), \"The Expected One\", and tries to force the British to commit troops.",
