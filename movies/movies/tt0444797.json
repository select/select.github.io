    "Plot": "A one-reel crime drama with crooks, ruses, kidnapping, escape and a twist, all wrapped in a coherent narrative. Screenwriter Lloyd Lonergan's amazing versatility served equally well in several genres. There is successful pictorial telling of the setup and attempted theft, and a little cross-cutting as the police come to the rescue (rescue of the rock, as the resourceful heroine obviously needs no rescuing). Thanhouser's popular Mignon Anderson's climactic stunt work shows that the stock players were remarkably versatile.",
