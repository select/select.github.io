    "Plot": "The Terrytoons are oddly interesting, mainly for anybody wanting to see (generally) older cartoons made by lesser known and lower-budget studios. They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content.'Grand Uproar' is for me among the weaker Terrytoons of 1933, which like the previous years was a hit and miss batch for Terrytoons. It is a pretty lacklustre cartoon and has the same amount of problems as it has the amount of strengths. 'Grand Uproar' is watchable as a one time watch, completest sake is the main reason to see it.Best asset is the music, which predictably is incredible. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. The ambitious, elaborate detail in the backgrounds is still great to see and some synchronisation is neat.A few decent gags and the characters, while not as zesty as before, are still charming.Outside of the backgrounds however, the animation is primitive at best with a fair bit of crudeness, over-simplicity and choppiness.Likewise, the story is paper thin and formulaic with a big air of over-familiarity due to doing very little new with a fairly tired premise. The gags are too few and on the most part they are not that funny or well-timed, not to mention completely unimaginative. Concluding, less than grand. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
