      "description": "Captain Bill Jones (George Houston) gets a Spanish doubloon from a passenger he was ferrying. Flat broke, he uses the doubloon to trick the greedy storekeeper Joblin (Harold Howard) into giving him a drink (or two) for free. Soon, the whole island is aflame with rumors of the treasure. After Joblin tries to put one over on Bill and fails, he allows Bill to get whatever he wants from his store in exchange for not getting sent to prison. After setting sail with Marge (Marion Nixon) for his lover's schooner Wildfire, he has to fight his way past Joblin. [NB: This is another Grand National Picture production, and if you compare it to others, Bank Alarm in particular, you can find alot of reused actors and music.] [Synopsis by uniQ .] You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page .",

The passenger explains that is a gold Spanish doubloon and the Captain is more than welcome to it.\n\nGoing ashore, the Captain decides to have some fun by telling stories indicating that he discovered four chests full of the coins, which were pirate treasure. The news spreads throughout the island and leads to kidnapping, torture, murder and an attack on the Captain's ship.\n\n---\n\nDirected by John Reinhardt, produced by George A.

Stone broke on the island of Quica and with his ship in need or re-stocking, Bill accepts an ancient Spanish doubloon from a young Australian named Carr in exchange for taking him to Tapillo, where Carr can take a ship to Sydney. Bill gives the doubloon to trader Joblin for supplies, and does not bother to correct the trader's impression that he has found a fabulous horde of pirate gold. With Madame Gruen, a slatternly jade who runs a waterfront boarding house, and Samson, her oily paramour, Joblin schemes to seize Captain Bill's supposed treasure trove. Together, they gather a a crew of cutthroats, led by Black Pierre, leader of the scum of the waterfront dives, to seize the treasure. Bill also meets Dr. Kelkey, loser in many bouts with a brandy bottle, and his ward, Madge Lewis, on a mission to find the man who murdered and robbed her father in Australia. Bill agrees to help her, but does not remember her as the young girl he had saved from a sinking ship a dozen years before.",
