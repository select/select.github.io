    "Plot": "A camera mounted on a yacht travels the Hudson. A malfunction gives the film a ghostly look. A bridge is before us, tugs and small crafts everywhere. We go under the bridge and pass a large water storage cylinder, church spires, and many small craft. The feeling is of speed. Smokestacks dominate one shot. In one area, two- and three-story buildings go to the water's edge. Then a more pastoral area comes into view, but factories are not far away. Docks and piers and bridges signal an area of commerce. One stretch of coast has pleasure boats tied at piers; a hillside resort dominates the frame. Trees on a green hill conclude the trip.",
