    "Plot": "A parody of Robinson Crusoe, with the principal characters given voice impersonations of Jack Benny, Fred Allen, Eddie Anderson, etc. A cannibal King expels his son from the tribe because he's a vegetarian. He finds his way to Robinson Crusoe's hut, and takes a job as his chauffeur. His first duty is to drive Crusoe's car for a proposed tiger hunt, but a tiger stows away and is about to pounce, but he's so repulsed by Crusoe's violin playing, he falls out. Soon the two are captured by the tribe. The royal father welcomes his son back, as they have an eye toward eating Crusoe. But when he again makes the musically sensitive tiger faint, and saves the tribe, Crusoe becomes the new chief.",
