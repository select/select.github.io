      "description": "A real curiosity in the Buster Keaton canon: “The Misadventures of Buster Keaton” was a theatrical film cobbled together from episodes of “Life with Buster Keaton,” a very-early ‘50s US TV program. In it, he portrayed the owner of a sporting goods store who moonlighted as a community theater’s “managing director, leading man and star.”  “Misadventures” was released apparently only in Europe, as a means to capitalize on Keaton’s continuing popularity there. Many of the gags in the show were lifted wholesale from other Keaton movies – such as the “falling wall” stunt from “Steamboat Bill Jr.”",
