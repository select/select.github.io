    "Plot": "Flippy is singing. This wakes the cat from his nap. The cat stops the bird from singing, but sees that if the bird doesn't sing, the solution is to get rid of the cat. Frantic to hold onto his life style, the cat now tries various means to get the bird to sing.The Flippy series was a pleasant, gag-filled bunch of cartoons tried out by Columbia during the waning days of its home-grown animation; by the time this was released, they were already in negotiations to have UPA produce and release their cartoons, even though the Columbia backlog continued to be released for a couple of years.That's Stan Freberg as the cat's voice.",
