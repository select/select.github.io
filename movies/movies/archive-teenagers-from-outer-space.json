      "description": "Aliens land on Earth with the intention of turning it into a feeding ground for their lobsteroid \"cattle\", but one of them (David Love) turns on the others and takes refuge with a teenage Earth girl (Dawn Anderson), pursued by another alien (Bryan Grant), armed with a ray gun that blasts the flesh off people, who will stop at nothing to capture him. Tom Graeff, who wrote, produced and directed the film, plays reporter Joe Rogers. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
