      "description": "The seaside resort of Anzio, south of Rome, became a British-American base in the Battle of Italy from January 21, 1944. The film dramatically depicts how two Ranger battalions behind German lines were razed to the ground, down to eight men... Dmytryk's experienced direction aims not for documentary, but for - at times impressive - entertainment.",

    "Plot": "Allied forces land at Anzio unopposed, but instead of moving inland and north to Rome, their commanding officer decides to dig in. A battle-hardened war correspondent borrows a jeep and driver and drives to Rome and back encountering no significant German forces. The report on the absence of the enemy is discounted as the general is concerned about having the strength to hold Anzio and support the offensive. By the time it is finally decided to make a move the Germans have arrived in strength. A US Ranger assault on Cisterna is ambushed with most of the forces killed or captured. A small group of survivors, including the war correspondent, struggle to make their way back to Anzio and report on the German defenses.",
