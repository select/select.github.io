    "Plot": "The Fudgets are like many families. George Fudget is the household breadwinner. His wife Irene takes his money, pays the bills, puts the remainder into their savings account, and sometimes takes a dollar here and there for her \"cookie jar\" savings so that she can on occasion buy those little extras for herself, her weakness being hats. George doesn't know about that cookie jar, so he chastises her every time she buys a hat. Sometimes their budget may go up, such as when George gets a new higher paying job. And sometimes they need to spend more than their budget, such as when something unexpectedly breaks and needs to be replaced. They just hope that they can weather any proverbial rainy days, for which they may or may not have enough in their savings.",
