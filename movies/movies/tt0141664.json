    "Plot": "The first of the talkartoons series. The art style is a bit all over the place and the animation more or less serves as a vehicle to play along with the audio. Some funny rubberbanding but lots of unexplainably freaky moments that just make this one feel overall pretty weird. A jumbled, messy oddball prototype that really doesnt hold up too well.",
