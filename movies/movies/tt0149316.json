    "Plot": "The Crow, owner of the S. Crow Insurance Agency, spots the Fox driving down the highway and asks him to sign his insurance policy. The Fox refuses, saying \"I never have an accident\", so the Crow is determined to see that he does. He rigs up some traps to injure the Fox but each one backfires. He electrifies a bunch of grapes but the Fox dons rubber gloves. He sends a falling tree on the fox but it lands on the crow instead. He tries to get the Fox to drive over a cliff but his car is part helicoptor! He also floods the Fox's house but that doesn't work either. Finally, the Fox agrees to sign when the Crow tells him about the luxurious hospital life awaiting him... and ultimately has his house dynamited by the Crow (who tells the Fox that his insurance policy has expired!).",
