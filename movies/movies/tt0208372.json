The mother is heartbroken and begs for the child, but the father is adamant that the marriage is over and the child is his. The child becomes bored living in his rich father's mansion, even though he's very well provided for. During one of the child's visits with his grandmother, the child's mother steals him away. They live in a run down apartment as the mother tries to make ends meet, but the child is happy. The father demands the police detectives to find his child. They eventually find the mother and child, but then the father must make a decision on the happiness of his child.",
