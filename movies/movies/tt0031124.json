      "description": "From IMDb : Henri Armides and his assistant, Garvey, blow up and rob a London bank in broad daylight and get away with 10,000 pounds. They hide the money in a radio but the radio is in the apartment that Colonel Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond and his intended bride, Phyllis Caverling, will be occupying after they are married. Married or not, they check out the honeymoon apartment. This does not bode well for Armides and Garvey's plans to recover the money; it also does not bode well for Phyllis and Drummond's plans to get married. New MPEG4 uploaded Nov. 2009 Stars: John Howard, Heather Angel, H. B. Warner, Reginald Denny, and E. E. Clive This movie can also be found here .
