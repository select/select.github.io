      "description": "Porky’s Garden is a 1937 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on September 11, 1937, and stars Porky Pig. This cartoon’s theme is a Looney Tunes theme from 1937, known as Porky Signature theme, but not “The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down”, which would be first used as the opening theme in “Rover’s Rival”. However, a few bars of “The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down” are played when the Podunk fair is introduced. This predates the use of “The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down” as the Looney Tunes theme, and is one of the earliest uses (if not the first) of this song in the Warner Brother’s cartoons, the last cartoon that Elmer Wait animated; he died about two months prior to the release. The film entered the Public Domain in 1965. Watch on RetroFlix.org:  https://retroflix.org/porkys-garden-1937/",

      "description": "A small town agricultural fair is giving a prize for the largest home grown product. Porky sets to work planting a garden; his neighbor tries a feed mix for his chickens. But the chickens won't eat the feed, so he sets them loose in Porky's garden (one eats some spinach and does a Popeye impression). Porky rescues a pumpkin that they missed and takes it to the fair. The neighbor's chickens eat a huckster's reducing pills on the way in, and just as they are winning first prize, reduce back to eggs, and Porky wins. This is a Computer Colorized version from 1992.",
