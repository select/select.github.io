      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Originally released as two films, this German epic covers the entirety of the Illiad as well as some closure that was not in the original poem. As such, it is a massive 217 minutes-long picture. The scale of the film was so massive that it almost bankrupted the studio that financed it. Modern viewers appreciate the scale and scope of Helena, though they feel that the pacing is a bit slow at times.  The download includes an English subtitle track. ",
