    "Plot": "Time exposure shows us Coney Island at night, from Luna Park to Dreamland. Panning left, brilliant lights come into view, defining a long, narrow strip of rides and attractions. We're up, looking out and down. One ride spins. The sign \"Luna Park\" comes into view. The pan continues, marking the distance to Dreamland, a larger area with fewer lights: the Steeple Chase and a Ferris wheel are near the back. Then the camera at eye level takes us to close-ups of buildings in Luna Park. Rides spin, pavilions beckon. The camera plans slowly right. It picks one tall structure and pans down and up, ending with a shot of an empty sky.",
