    "Plot": "Gandy Goose and Sour Puss play Laurel &amp; Hardy, including a portly silhouette and fastidious hand movements for the cat. They go on a picnic, where they are afflicted with a chipmunk, the bete noir of the post-war cartoons. Maybe they were becoming familiar to people in the growing suburbs.Mannie Davis has directed this as a silent comedy, without a word of dialogue. Although very inconsistent, the Gandy Goose series was among the best that Terry did, mostly because there was a lot of experimentation. You never knew quite what you would get and that surprise kept it fresh and funny.I do have some issue with the art. The characters have a two-dimensional look to them. However the story and gags are very good.",
