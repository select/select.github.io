Of course, it was a total fiasco and the film fells into oblivion. Happily enough, it was made available on videotape in the early 1990's (WITHOUT the hardcore sequences...) and recently, Jean-Pierre Mocky, the French director, who owns his own movie theater, \"Le Brady\", in Paris, was able to show the film to moviegoers.
