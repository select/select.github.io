The house then passes to another family, one of whose sons becomes obsessed with the hands. This son develops sadistic tendencies and, acquiring hypnotic powers, finds himself exercising a mystical control over a brother's fiancée. She repels him, however, and in doing so breaks the spell. The hypnotist, turning to the stone hands, is killed.",
