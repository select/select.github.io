    "Plot": "With a fondness for gambling, Jim Saunders is given to neglecting his wife and child. One night during his absence at the saloon, Miguel Gomez, a Mexican outlaw, for whom $1,000 reward is offered, enters Jim's home and demands food of Mrs. Saunders. Her little child, suffering with a severe attack of croup demands her constant attention and she tells Gomez to help himself. The child is taken with a fit of choking, and her mother, alarmed, asks the outlaw to go for a doctor. He consents and starts on a run for the nearest physician, miles away. As he is running through the foothills, he is met by Saunders, who recognizes him and stops him at the point of his pistol. The Mexican, anxious to notify the doctor, grapples with Jim. They struggle to the edge of a cliff over which he hurls Jim, who falls to the bottom stunned. Miguel jumps upon Jim's horse and hastens on to the doctor, whom he tells of the sick child and induces him to go with him to its relief. After a breakneck ride, they reach Saunder's home just in time to save the child from death. Jim Saunders, who has recovered from his fall, hurries to his home and through the window, sees the Mexican. He rushes in and demands his surrender. Jim's wife tells him of the Mexican's generous deed through which their child was saved. Jim hangs his head in shame, and acknowledges that the outlaw is a better man than himself, for had he stayed at home with his wife and child, instead of spending his time at the saloon gambling, he would have proven himself more of a man. Mrs. Saunders tells Gomez that he may go unmolested by them for whatever may he his faults, they must acknowledge his goodness of heart in helping them and their child. Tenderly bending over the little girl, he smooths her forehead, she takes his hand in hers and Miguel Gomez is permitted to depart in peace with their blessing.",
