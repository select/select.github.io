In the story of GILDA, Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) goes to work for Ballin Mundson (George Macready), the proprietor of an illegal gambling casino in a South American city, and quickly rises to become Mundson's main man.

Mundson, unaware of their previous love affair, assigns Farrell the job of keeping Gilda a faithful wife. Fraught with hatred, Gilda does her best to antagonize, intimidate, and instill jealousy in Farrell- until circumstances allow him to get even.",
