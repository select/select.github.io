    "Plot": "Here's an early example of a cartoon staple: a gag reel in the form of a news reel. This soon became a standard of the animation houses, with Leon Schlesinger's cartoons for Warner Brothers including DETOURING AMERICA and SCREWBALL FOOTBALL.It's an early writing credit for Tedd Pierce, who would soon find himself on the staff at Termite Terrace. Like many a cartoon talent, although he spent much of his career writing for Schlesinger's crew, he migrated hither and yon, taking a hand in the Fleischer's GULLIVER'S TRAVELS and UPA's Mr. Magoo shorts. He also worked as a voice actor in the cartoons. After a career that included more than 200 cartoons, he died in 1972 at the age of 65.",
