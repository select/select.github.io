    "Plot": "A pompous British explorer narrates this cartoon about his efforts to trap a gorilla.This late cartoon by Ub Iwerks has the usual mixture of good jokes, out of date jokes, and jokes that have grown offensive. The shots of his leaving home to go on the trip are funny -- and he repeated them in this cartoons sequel, the far inferior THE EGG HUNT -- the sign posted in Africa proclaiming the city limits of Los Angeles was a reference to the city's habit, at the time of annexing outlying territory; and, of course, the way the African natives are portrayed is now considered racist.",
