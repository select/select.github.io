Before he could tell anyone, he mysteriously vanished. Many years later budding physics student Dean Hollister and his discredited physics teacher have become obsessed with the same mystery. What had been a rare phenomenon is suddenly happening all over the world. The day it happens is a regular night shift for Dean at his mother's diner. Black rifts appear in the sky. Behind those rifts, something is moving. It's watching us.",
