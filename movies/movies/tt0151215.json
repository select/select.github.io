    "Plot": "Here we have the 1935 remake of the 1932 Terrytoon THE MAD KING. The evil/insane/nutty cat king is oppressing the mice peasantry until they rise in revolt.Although the technical aspects of this version have advanced over the 1932 version, it raises a gloomy and uninteresting prospect for the future. Will the 1938 version be in Technicolor? Will the 1944 version feature Mighty Mouse, come to save the day? Will the 1956 version be the last one? Which version will be the best and why should we bother looking at any of them except for that one? This is not, of course, a problem that would have arisen in the movie theater in 1935. \"Oh, look! It's a Terrytoon!\", the recognition you had seen something like this before and a vague wish it had been a Mickey Mouse cartoon instead would have been the limits of analysis.However, that's not the way we have looked at cartoons like this for a half century. It's been a matter of a half hour of fur or so of them or looking at as many as tolerable on the Internet. By that standard, who cares?",
