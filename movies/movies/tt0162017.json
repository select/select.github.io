    "Plot": "Here's a Christmas cartoon sure to put a smile on your face. This late synchronized cartoon has Santa delivering presents by throwing them out of his sleigh and a sequence in which a dog wakes kittens so they can get their gifts off the tree.It's a short cartoon and although it may seem that they ran out of ideas after three and a half minutes, it grows wilder and more chaotic as it goes on.I am not usually a fan of Paul Terry's sound cartoon. They often seem aimed at small, stupid children. This one, however, is quite clearly and unabashedly cute, particularly the sequence in which the dog barks at the toys, which seems to have been animated by Art Babbitt.",
