    "Plot": "I do not understand the Japanese language and so my review of \"Taro's New Train\" must be understood in this context. However, I also noticed that although I couldn't read the intertitle cards, I could easily enjoy this film.The first portion and a tiny portion at the end are live action. A father brings his son a toy train and the child loves it. However, when he goes to bed at night, the train comes to life (using stop- motion) and climbs into bed with the child. Next, a cartoon begins and you see lots of animals riding the train like human passengers. What follows are some lessons on what NOT to do on a train--such as leaving your bags on the seat so others cannot sit and tossing trash about the car or out the windows. It's all very comical and engaging...with very nice animation for the time period. I can only assume the purpose of the film was to educate people on proper train passenger etiquette.",
