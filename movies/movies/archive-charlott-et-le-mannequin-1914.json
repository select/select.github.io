      "description": "Mabel’s Married Life (1914) is an American comedy silent film made by Keystone Studios starring and co-written by Charles Chaplin and Mabel Normand, and directed by Chaplin. As was so often the case during his first year in film, Chaplin’s character is soon staggering drunk. The film was followed in 1915 by Mabel and Fatty’s Married Life as a follow-up (but not quite a “sequel”). Watch on RetroFlix.org:  https://retroflix.org/charlott-et-le-mannequin-1914/",
