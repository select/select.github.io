      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Greta Garbo vehicle The Mysterious Lady was a massive hit on release, with even an exorbitant budget being recovered and then some. Modern reviews find a lot to enjoy from the film outside of Garbo's performance as well. In the picture, Garbo plays a spy who must choose between her new romance or her country, with drama and conflict arising constantly.",
