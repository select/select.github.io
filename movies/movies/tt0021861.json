      "description": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021861/ A strikingly handsome (and tall), youthful Gary Cooper -- this is the opportunity to see a giant screen legend when he was a vibrant young newcomer! This alone merits seeing this movie. The dialogue is witty, pithy and fun -- in fact, give me the screenwriter from 1931 over most of today's movies!. There is a lot of fast-paced and exciting western action (and the stuntwork is just plain fun to watch). Yes, this was relatively early movie making, and in some ways it shows, but that also provides tremendous enjoyment for the film buff. Watch it with a light heart, but with reverence for the old films, and I think you can't help but enjoy it. Xvid",
