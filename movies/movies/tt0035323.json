    "Plot": "\"Friend turned foe\" reads the newspaper headline. But Lois Lane suspects there's more to the story of Superman turning into a jewel thief and bank robber. And, of course, Clark Kent, knows it can't be true. But someone is out there committing crimes--and he's doing it dressed like Superman. Clark Kent finally meets the impostor at the opera. And that's where the impostor meets the real Superman. Catching the low-class crook is easy. But behind the cheap gangster is a powerful crime boss. And he proves more resourceful than his stooge.",
