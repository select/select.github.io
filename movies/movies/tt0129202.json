      "description": "Have you ever seen a B-western so ineptly produced its title card was misspelled? Well you have now. And as in some of Ed Wood's scenes night turns to day and back to night as if the Sun had circled the Earth in three minutes. (Maybe this is where Ed got the idea.) It's a real hoot for all the wrong reasons. Directed by Victor Adamson (as Denver Dixon) Released in 1934 a.k.a. \"Lightning Bill\" (intended title) Complete print?",
