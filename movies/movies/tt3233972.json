    "Plot": "After finishing her wish during the celebration of her 18th birthday, orphaned at birth young Jordyn, witnesses her guardian Aunt Ruth saying something rather cryptic in a loud voice, and then, in front of everyone's astounded eyes, perform an act of utter despair. Up to the present time, Aunt Ruth has been silently protecting her beloved niece, but now that she is hospitalised, Jordyn will sense that a change she unwillingly undergoes, somehow distorts her perception of reality as she finds herself waking up in strange places trapped in, what seems to be, a continued dream-like sequence. Is Jordyn awake or is she dreaming, but most of all, what mystery shrouds her mother's origin? Before long, something is going to catch up with her, as the perplexed Jordyn is besieged by subtle, yet malicious attacks up until evil finds a way in through her thoughts and fantasies, eventually rooting her out of her frail existence and replacing her with another, sinister doppelgänger. Undoubtedly, whatever robs Jordyn of her life is also trying to seal her fate.",
