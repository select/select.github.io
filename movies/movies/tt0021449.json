A low-budget independent effort, it stands as a rare glimpse into the industry’s growing pains during one of cinema’s most transformative moments.\n\nRestored and revisited for classic film lovers, this early talkie is both a time capsule and a showcase of Sandrich’s emerging talent—years before he would direct musical landmarks like Top Hat and Holiday Inn.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?

Pierpont Ginsburg, after declaring, in a Yiddish accent, that \"talking pictures are in their infantry,\" decides to put all of his savings into a big-budgeted musical, starring the sensation of Paris (with a bad French accent), Adore Renee, and a swishy leading man, Reginald Whitlock. Meanwhile, his daughter, Judy Ginsburg, gets involved in a romance with Ginsburg's Gentile lawyer, John Applegate. His efforts aren't helped any by the projectionist who mixes up the sound-disc reels, with the images not matching the dialogue and sound effects, during a showing for prospective film buyers and exhibitors.",
