His perfect life suddenly changes when Adam’s boss (Jeff Daniels) gives him a big promotion at work. Feeling invincible and a bit intoxicated, Adam goes through a tragic diving accident that causes him to become a quadriplegic. Heartbroken and frustrated with the way things will be going forward, Adam thinks his life is over. He has a hard time dealing with his emotions and relationships - that is until a mouthy yet comic Russian nurse (Lena Olin) comes into his life and shows him that life isn’t over, life has just begun.\n2020.
