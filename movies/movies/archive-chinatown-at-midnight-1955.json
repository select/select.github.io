      "description": "Chinatown at Midnight is a 1949 film directed by Seymour Friedman and starring Hurd Hatfield. He was best known for often playing characters of handsome, narcissistic young men, most notably Dorian Gray in the film The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). Hatfield seems a little too urbane to be credible as the unbalanced heist man-cum-killer in this film, but the movie does its best to justify his casting by spinning the murderer as a multi-lingual dandy whose bachelor pad landlady raves about his “excellent taste for a young man.” Find out more about the movie here which is reading Film Nolr and Wikipedia article. ",
