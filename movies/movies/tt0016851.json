    "Plot": "Is there a place in the world for Harry Hogan? On the day his parents and burly brothers kick him out of the house for never earning money - and whiling away his time taking music lessons, his teacher, Professor Von Tempo, gives Harry a music diploma to get rid of him. Harry's so bad that Von Tempo's neighbors complain during his lessons. Armed with the diploma, Harry sets out to seek his fortune. He spends the night in a flea-bag hotel, figures out how to get his bass fiddle out of the room without paying for the lodging, and looks for a gig. On his first day, he joins Von Tempo's street band and he meets Penrod the rag picker. Which encounter will prove fateful?",
