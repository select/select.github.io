      "description": "“THE WILD SWANS” Fairytale Feature (Denmark) Notes: A fairytale made in close collaboration with Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. The production transforms H.C. Andersen’s fairytale The Wild Swans into a spectacular universe and takes the viewer to an artistically dark, magic world populated by princes, princesses, evil stepmothers, corpse eaters and toads. The production design was created by Queen Margrethe and achieved using subtle 3D computer effects, and actors who emphasize the epic nature of the story. The film examines life’s great themes: love, wickedness, perseverance and the indefatigable struggle for justice. Shot on Arriflex Alexa and Cooke S4 lenses. Director: Peter Flinth Production design: HM Queen Margrethe II Production Company: JJ Film Productions Starring: Thure Lindhardt, Ghita Nørby, Stine Fisher Christensen, Jens Jørn Spottag, Benedicte Hansen",
