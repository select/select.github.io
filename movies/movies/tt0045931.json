      "description": "Jennifer is a 1953 film noir directed by Joel Newton and starring Ida Lupino, Howard Duff, and Robert Nichols.   Time Out magazine (London) wrote of the film, \"This is gothic romance crossed with early '50s noir, worth a look for the sake of the great Wong Howe. He tackles this B-picture with unfailing artistry, creating images that are strong without being showy, atmospheric yet perfectly naturalistic.   Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_(1953_film) Suggested Film Noirs: http://bit.ly/2tLevkl The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.
