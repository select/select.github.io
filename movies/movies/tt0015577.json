      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This comedy follows a young woman whose parents tell her that they are in the process of divorcing. Distraught, and after discovering they still love each other despite their issues, she tries to think of ways to reunite them. She eventually decides to pretend to be dating an actor with a risqué reputation, which brings her parents together to attempt to stop her \"romance\". While the film was quite topical at the time of release, it is not remembered as one of the great films of the silent era. Still, modern viewers appreciate the acting and feel-good comedy. ",
