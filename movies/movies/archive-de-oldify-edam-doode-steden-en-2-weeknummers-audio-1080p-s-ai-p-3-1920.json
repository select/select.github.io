      "description": "Edam is an old 11th century Dutch town that borders the former Zuiderzee, nowadays called the IJsselmeer. It used to be a thriving fishing and trade village but its role became less significant after the Zuiderzee was closed in by the Afsluitdijk. Edam is world-famous for its round cheeses that are about half the size of a football and have the characteristic red skin and great taste! In 2007 Edam celebrated 650 years of holding city rights. This film shows Edam in summer and autumn as it was over a century ago and also gives insight into how its famous cheeses were and still are being produced. Besides stunning scenes of the old town, the film includes footage of the old shipyard where most of the Dutch war ships under the command of Michael De Ruyter were built in the 17th century. The \"Chief Mouser\" must have been visiting from Downing Street 10 to catch all the mice among the cheeses... The film also shows how old locks are manually opened and closed and farmers waiting with their sheep to cross over. The orginal B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced and colorized by means of modern Artificial Intelligence video software.
