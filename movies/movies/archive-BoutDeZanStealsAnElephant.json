      "description": "This delightful little film was directed by Louis Feuillade in 1913. I have lightened a few scenes, added public domain music and with the help of Google translated the French into English. The boy is played by RenÃ© Poyen. This silent film is a wonderful example of the prolific Feuillade's French wit. Take a look. It is worth a few minutes of your time.",
