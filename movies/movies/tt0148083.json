    "Plot": "Gandy Goose is reading a book about the end of the world when suddenly a raindrop falls on his head. He lets that go; but when another raindrop falls on his head, he announces that the sky is falling and whips the rest of the barnyard animals into a panic. They evade a sneaky wolf and make their way to the king, a lion who happens to be practicing his knitting when they arrive. The lion refuses to believe Gandy's story, but has his three wizards investigate the matter. Gandy only serves to drive them crazy. The lion has the goofy goose thrown into the cell block (his anachronistic term for the dungeon). Later, as the king gives a toast to peace and quiet, a thunderstorm causes the roof to cave in. The sky is falling! The lion releases Gandy and demands that he do something about it.",
