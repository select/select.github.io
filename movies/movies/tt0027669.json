      "description": "Professor Brent (Lloyd Ingraham) invents a radium tube that gives off previously undiscovered rays which can control electricity. He rather foolishly trusts Kincaid (Wheeler Oakman) who imprisons him and forces him to use his invention to crash mail planes, so Kincaid and his gang can rob them. Tim Caverly, alias Tim Toomey (Tim McCoy), an FBI agent, goes to find out what's going on, posing as an outlaw wanting in on Kincaid's racket. With the inadvertent aid of Brent's daughter Natalie (Claudia Dell), Tim discovers Brent and the details of the recent plane crashes. But even when victory is within reach, anything can, and since this is a classic western, it will happen... [Synopsis by uniQ .] [Note from uniQ : This file is probably the epitome of all bad science plot films from the 20s and 30s up to the 50s. It's (probably) the grandaddy of films that have 'evil computer hackers' that can turn your lights on and off in them these days. Not real science, but plot-exploitable, potentially panic-inducing science.] You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page .",
