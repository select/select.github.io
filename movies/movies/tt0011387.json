      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Still considered by many to be the best adaptation of the novel, the 1920 version of The Last Mohicans isn't without its issues; most noticeably using almost exclusively white actors to portray Native characters. However, this version has been especially praised for its visual storytelling and for a fantastic performance from Barbara Bedford. ",
