      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Norma Shearer was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her role in this film, though she lost, to herself no less, for another role from the same Academy Awards year. This film was released the same year as its source material, although it doesn't really suffer for it. The film was a modest success, but really the main draw of the film is Ms. Shearer's performance. ",
