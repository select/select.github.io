      "description": "This test of an underwater atomic bomb was conducted by the US army near Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on 25 July 1946. As the result, the health of the native inhabitants of the nearby islands was severely affected due to the atomic fallout, causing many forms of cancer. The original film has been motion-stabilized, enhanced and colorized using state of the art \"DeOldify\" colorization software. To our opinion the results are rather impressive!",
