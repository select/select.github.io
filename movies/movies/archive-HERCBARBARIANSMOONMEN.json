Custom menu with a photo of the title character with drive-in style audio, SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the .zip, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. But I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be seen here on this site. This disc contains the movies HERCULES AGAINST THE BARBARIANS & HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN, along with the preview and intermission reels.",
