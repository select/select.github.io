      "description": "So Dark the Night is a 1946 American crime film with film noir influences featuring Steven Geray, Micheline Cheirel and Eugene Borden. Based on a story written by Aubrey Wisberg, the screenplay was written by Dwight V. Babcock and Martin Berkeley, and directed by Joseph H. Lewis. Plot: After his doctor recommends a lengthy vacation, French detective Henri Cassin (Steven Geray) settles into the bucolic village of St. Margot for a rest. Checking into a family-owned hotel, the detective soon finds himself pursued by the pretty innkeeper's daughter, Nanette (Micheline Cheirel), and succumbs to her charms. Shortly after the two marry, Nanette is found strangled to death, and Henri suspects Leon (Paul Marion), her ex-fiancé -- until Leon turns up murdered as well.",
