    "Plot": "Falling into the same perplexing predicament that doomed the hapless travellers in Le déshabillage impossible (1900), and L'auberge ensorcelée (1897), an unsuspecting man still in his broad-brimmed top hat and overcoat finds himself incessantly harassed by an annoying poltergeist. This time, the utterly uncooperative personal belongings seem unable to behave themselves and stay removed as intended, keeping reappearing on his head and body again and again. Unfortunately, not even a large and heavy wooden desk is enough to pin the insubordinate garments to the ground. Can the man outsmart the vindictive spirit?",
