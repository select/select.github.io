      "description": "The Dutch Southern province of Limburg was the first to be liberated towards the end of WW2. As recorded by the American 117th Regimental Combat Team, the village of Mesch in Zuid Limburg was the first to be liberated on 12 September 1944. This was precisely 90 days after D-day and fierce battles in the Belgian Ardennes. The Americans continued onto the city of Maastricht which was liberated two days later on the 14th of September 1944. In the following days the advance of the allied forces halted. From 17 to 25 september 1944 Operation Market Garden took place, during which an attempt was made to capture the Rhine bridge near Arnhem. This operation failed, eventually resulting in a stalemate situation during the following winter in which the Netherlands were devided between the German occupied north and the liberated part south of the main rivers: Rhine, Maas and Waal. That winter is commonly known as the \"Hunger winter\" during which many people in the North suffered starvation and at least 20,000 people died as the result. It took until the beginning of March 1945 before the remaining part of Limburg was liberated, involving among other the cities of Venlo and Roermond. In this film we see highly interesting images of the city of Maastricht, just after the liberation, collaborators being arrested, scenes at the police station, huge damage to bridges and towns allong the river Maas, German POW's and many images of Maastricht during the following winter.
