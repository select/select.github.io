    "Plot": "Dr. Wynant D. Hubbard, on an expedition into upper Rhodesia in Africa makes an effort to overcome the tsetse fly disease among domestic cattle. He plans to crossbreed wild buffalo, who have developed an immunity to the fly, with domestic cattle. The natives offer him trap rings of grass into which pointed sticks have been inserted, but Dr. Hubbard is afraid of infection in the wounds these sticks would inflict on the cattle's feet. He decides on camouflaged, V-shaped pitfalls. A pit is dug for the cameraman and we hear the thunder of hoofs as the buffalo stampede over it. Finally a large cow is caught, and a dragnet is hastily constructed. Her calf is caught by the natives who bring it into camp with the aid of ropes and persuasion. The commentator explains that both animals will aid in the scientist's fight against the tsetse fly.",
