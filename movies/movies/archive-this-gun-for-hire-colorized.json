      "description": "Hit man Philip Raven (Alan Ladd) is hired by Willard Gates (Laird Cregar) to get rid of a blackmailer. But Raven turns on his employer when he finds out he was paid with marked bills. Meanwhile, entertainer Ellen Graham (Veronica Lake) is enlisted by a Senate committee to help get incriminating info on Gates, who is under investigation for espionage. When Raven and Ellen meet accidentally, they make an uneasy alliance to take down Gates. But Ellen just happens to be the girlfriend of the police detective (Robert Preston) who is trying to catch Raven. Based on the novel by Graham Greene. Alan Ladd as Philip Raven Veronica Lake as Ellen Graham Robert Preston as Michael Crane Laird Cregar as Willard Gates Tully Marshall as Alvin Brewster Marc Lawrence as Tommy Olin Howland as Blair Fletcher Roger Imhof as Senator Burnett Pamela Blake as Annie Frank Ferguson as Albert Baker I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
