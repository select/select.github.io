      "description": "Exclusive PizzaFLIX Halloween Edition. Restored and specially edited for YouTube. \nStars: Libby Hall, Denis Adams, Charles West, Howard Ware\nWriters/Directors: Claude Alexander, Larry Buchanan\n\nThis is the story of a beautiful witch killed centuries ago. When a curious student opens her grave, he removes a dagger from her heart. Released from her earthly tomb, she embarks on a campaign of revenge against her murderer’s descendants. Will he end her reign of terror? Or fall for her hypnotic beauty?\n\nMovie Class by PizzaFLIX: Self-declared “Schlockmeister” Larry Buchanan (1923-2004) made roughly 30 movies over four decades, horrifying critics but delighting fans.  With titles like ATTACK OF THE EYES CREATURES (1965) and CURSE OF THE SWAMP CREATURE, his Z-Movies also gratified financial backers as his \"guerrilla\" style of filmmaking usually turned a profit.",
