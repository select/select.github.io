      "description": "Detective Philip Marlowe is hired when a rare doubloon is stolen, and he soon discovers that it is being used for blackmail purposes. Marlowe's involvement has him encounter a girl who goes into hysterics when touched by a man; a domineering mother; three corpses; a couple of scuffles in which he gets his clock cleaned; a secretary who killed her boss, and a rich boy (who qualifies as a S.O.B. by two definitions) who is having trouble with the Mafia. Based on the Raymond Chandler novel \"The High Window\" George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe Nancy Guild as Merle Davis Conrad Janis as Leslie Murdock Roy Roberts as Police Lt. Breeze Fritz Kortner as Rudolph Vannier Florence Bates as Mrs. Elizabeth Murdock Marvin Miller as Vince Blair Reed Hadley as Dr. Moss I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
