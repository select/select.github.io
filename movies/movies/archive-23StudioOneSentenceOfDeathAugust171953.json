Dean is the most memorable of the performances in a story that seems to be patched from various detective movies and TV shows. As the socialite who thinks Dean is not the killer, Betsy Palmer also should be commended for the various emotions she pulls throughout the hour. If you've seen various film noir pictures, you should be able to predict what happens in the end but I definitely won't reveal here. Included with vintage Westinghouse commercials. For James Dean's performance alone, this one is definitely worth seeking out!",
