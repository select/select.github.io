      "description": "Synopsis Who Killed Amir? is a something of a curiosity item; a succès d'estime boasting the creme of the Iranian actors but somehow missing its mark, specially with the general public. It consists of well known Iranian actors and actresses speaking monologues into the camera, describing why they loved Amir and why they all wanted to kill him! These characters represent Amir's wife, mistress, best friend, boss, therapist, step daughter, etc. We learn more about these people, and their idea of love and friendship, than about Amir. Directed by: Mehdi Karampoor Date of birth: 18 February 1977, Tehran, Iran Writing credits: Mehdi Karampoor, Mehdi Kia, Khosrow Naghibi Music: Fardin Khalatbari Year: 2006 Country: Iran Language: Farsi Color: Color Runtime: 92 min.",
