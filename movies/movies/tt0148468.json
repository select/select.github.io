    "Plot": "A topical (at the time) cartoon featuring a madcap, slapstick baseball game between a USA team, featuring Gandy Goose and his pal Sourpuss, taking on the Mexican League Bulls, featuring bulls of course. This was made when there were only a few African-Americans and not very many Hispanics playing on major league teams in the American and National Leagues, and also when the Mexican League was drawing some top-flight American ballplayers south of the border by paying more money. The Mexican League threat didn't last long, but several major-league stars took the jump.",
