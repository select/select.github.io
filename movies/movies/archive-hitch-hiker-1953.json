      "description": "Two friends on a fishing trip in Mexico pick up a stranded motorist who turns out to be an escaped psychopath who sadistically taunts and threates them as he makes his way cross-cuntry to a ferryboat for his getaway. Edmond O'Brien as Roy Collins Frank Lovejoy as Gilbert Bowen William Talman as Emmett Myers José Torvay as Capt. Alvarado I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
