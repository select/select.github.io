      "description": "It's Friday @PizzaFLIX \nStars: Myrna Loy, Loretta Young, Zasu Pitts\nDirector: Alexander Korda\n🍕Myrna Loy Before The Thin Man🍕\nBefore she became Hollywood’s beloved Nora Charles, Myrna Loy turned heads in one of her earliest breakout roles—playing a seductive Romani gypsy who stirs chaos and desire in a peaceful Hungarian household. Released by First National Pictures and directed by Alexander Korda, this pre-Code drama blends domestic tension with exoticism, all anchored by Loy’s magnetic screen presence.\n\nSet on a rural estate, the story unfolds when a violent storm brings a mysterious young woman—played by Loy—into the home of a respectable family. Her arrival disrupts the quiet order of their lives, igniting jealousy, forbidden attraction, and emotional unrest. The supporting cast includes Loretta Young, Zasu Pitts, and Alice Joyce, but it's Loy’s bold, early performance that truly commands the screen.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?

With strong visual style and a daring lead performance, it captures a moment in cinema when boundaries were being tested—and stars like Myrna Loy were just beginning to shine.\n\n#TheSquall #MyrnaLoy #LorettaYoung #ZasuPitts #AliceJoyce #AlexanderKorda #FirstNationalPictures #1929Movies #PreCodeHollywood #GoldenAgeOfHollywood #ClassicCinema #pizzaflix",
