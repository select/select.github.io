      "description": "This film shows the beautiful German city of Dresden not long before World War II around 1936. Watching this film becomes extremely emotional if one realizes that what can be seen here no longer exists because of alied bombing raids. These raids on Dresden took place from 13 to 15 February 1945 whereby almost the complete city was destroyed. The raids became a symbol of the “terror bombing” campaign against Germany, which was one of the most controversial Allied actions of the war. Some people called and still call this bombardment a War Crime. Just watch this film to see how beautiful it was and to realize that approximately 25,000 innocent civilians were killed during the bombardment to understand such opinions. For more information, please read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II Some parts of Dresden have been rebuilt.
