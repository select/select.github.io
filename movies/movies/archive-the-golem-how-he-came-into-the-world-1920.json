      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the first great examples of German Expressionism, The Golem: How He Came into the World is a silent horror film that follows a Jewish rabbi as he creates a seemingly indestructible creature to defend his people against discrimination and destruction. Unfortunately, after his people are saved, the Golem turns its violence against his creator. It was a massive success in Germany and in its small run in the US, and is frequently considered a critical turning point in the horror genre.",
