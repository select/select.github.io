      "description": "Our hero is a family man who writes science fiction on the side. Somewhere along the way the stuff he writes starts becoming reality. As with all the stories about being able to rewrite the world the protagonists screws it up. From Ursula K Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven to the John Candy vehicle Delirious, they just can't get it right. Optional English subtitles (I called the audio track language Polish but that is just a guess)",
