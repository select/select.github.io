      "description": "After being dumped by her fiancé, a telephone operator (Anne Baxter) ends up drunk and almost raped by a lecherous photgrapher (Raymond Burr), who is found dead the next morning. With no memory of exactly what happened, and afraid of being arrested for his murder, she accepts help from a journalist (Richard Conte) who offers his newspaper's support in exchange for an exclusive interview. Directed by Fritz Lang, based on a story by Vera Caspary. Anne Baxter as Norah Larkin Richard Conte as Casey Mayo Ann Sothern as Crystal Carpenter Raymond Burr as Harry Prebble Jeff Donnell as Sally Ellis Richard Erdman as Al George Reeves as Police Capt. Sam Haynes Ruth Storey as Rose Miller Fay Baker as Switchboard Monitor Nat 'King' Cole as himself I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
