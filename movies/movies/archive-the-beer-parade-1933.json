      "description": "Scrappy and Oopie, though little boys, happily celebrate the return of beer after fourteen years, with the help of brew-guzzling gnomes, apparently from the \"Rip Van Winkle\" story. They leave an allegorical \"Prohibition\" figure (ugly old man in stovepipe hat) stripped and chased off. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/beer-parade-1933/",
