      "description": "Filmed over nearly five years in twenty-five countries on five continents, and shot on seventy-millimetre film, \"Samsara\" transports us to the varied worlds of sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial complexes, and natural wonders. In the 1970s, \"Samsara\" would have been known as a head trip. The critic Matt Zoller Seitz calls it \"a trance movie.\" For Fricke and his producer and collaborator Mark Magidson, it is a continuation of the meditative imagery they used in \"Baraka\" (1992), which intensely regarded the strangeness and wonder of our planet. Both films draw a sharp contract between the awe of nature and the sometimes ruthless imposition of man's will.",
