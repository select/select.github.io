      "description": "This print is much less than perfect. However the heavy blue cast has been removed and the excessive contrast reduced. Also now it is in the standard MPEG4 (MP4) format with a smaller down footprint.   “Creaky but fun” “More than fascinating” “Good early talkie” (IMDB reviews quotes).   William Powell as Philo Vance is confronted with a murder mystery and an old mansion filled suspects at each others throats. Good cast and superior production values for a 68-minute whodunit. Followed by “The Bishop Murder Case.” IMDB rating 6.8. Directed by Frank Tuttle. Released in 1929. Complete print. AKA “The Greene Murder Case”",
