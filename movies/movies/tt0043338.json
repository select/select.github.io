      "description": "Ace in the Hole, also known as The Big Carnival, is a 1951 American Film Noir directed by Billy Wilder and starring Kirk Douglas as a cynical, disgraced reporter who stops at nothing to try to regain a job on a major newspaper. The film co-stars Jan Sterling and features Robert Arthur, Richard Benedict and Porter Hall. The story is a biting examination of the seedy relationship between the press, the news it reports and the manner in which it reports it. The film also shows how a gullible public can be manipulated by the press.  In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". These Wikipedia and Film Nolr of the Week articles provide more information about this movie.",
