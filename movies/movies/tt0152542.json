    "Plot": "The Old Colonel is playing checkers with his daughter hen the wolf shows up with the deed, demanding her hand and other parts. Can the jockey boyfriend win the Kentucky Derby and save the day, or might something different and interesting happen? If there were two people keeping the melodrama alive in the 1930s, it was Tod Slaughter in England, who starred in cheap movie versions of the classic mellers and who would continue to barnstorm in the roles until his death in 1956; and Paul Terry in the US, who did cartoon versions for the small children with plenty of gags. Unfortunately, the plots were limited and any attempt to exaggerate the performances merely resulted in accuracy. Adding in villains in capes and silk hats who rode penny-farthing cycles only served to make adults snicker.",
