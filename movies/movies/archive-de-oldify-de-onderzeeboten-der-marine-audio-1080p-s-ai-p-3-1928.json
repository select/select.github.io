      "description": "Interesting film about the Dutch Navy's submarines in 1928. Among other, it shows the subs Hr.Ms. O 10 and Hr.Ms. O 11 and Van Berkel seaplanes in action as well as the very old Hr.Ms. Koningin Emma der Nederlanden converted into a floating barracks. The Hr.Ms. O 10 went into service on 1 September 1926 and the Hr.Ms. O 11 on 18 January 1926 The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, contrast- and brightness enhanced, de-noised and A.I. upscaled and colorized.
