    "Plot": "Van Beuren cartoons are extremely variable, especially in the number of gags and whether the absurdist humour shines through enough (sometimes it does, other times it doesn't), but are strangely interesting. Although they are often poorly animated with barely existent stories and less than compelling lead characters, they are also often outstandingly scored, there can be some fun support characters and some are well-timed and amusing.'Singing Saps' is among the worst 1930 Van Beuren/Aesop's Fables cartoons. Van Beuren may have done marginally worse overall, but 'Singing Saps' to me is towards the bottom. It does contain pretty much all of the faults of Van Beuren's worst, or all the faults of many Van Beuren cartoons, while having a few good points. Van Beuren have actually done quite a number of watchable or more cartoons, a few pretty good even though imperfect. So it's not as if they are all being hated on.Its best asset is the music score, pretty much the best thing consistently of Van Beuren's output (sometimes even the only good thing). It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. Some of the synchronisation is nicely done and there is some liveliness pace-wise. However, pretty much all the fault of Van Beuren's cartoons are present here. The animation is not good, in fact it is downright bad most of the time with erratically sloppy character designs in particular while the simplistic background detail and lack of fluidity and crispness are just as difficult to ignore. Often you can't actually tell what the animals are actually meant to be.None of the characters are that interesting or fun, most are over-cutesy and unmemorable and others are pretty annoying. Story is very slight to the point of non-existence, the little there is being formulaic, and not only doesn't go very far but it feels random and disjointed at times. If you are looking for sense too, look elsewhere.Basically 'Singing Saps' is a stringing along of gags structured in a way that's disorganised and random. generally, while having a fair bit going on, it is very low on laughs. In terms of quality none of the gags are amusing or inventive, never rising above the forgettable and there is not much absurdist about them. The cartoon felt very rushed to me on the whole, despite some liveliness, and the action was very confused and failed to make much sense.To conclude, another weak Van Beuren effort. 3/10 Bethany Cox",
