      "description": "Charlie Chan is a fictional  Honolulu police  detective created by author  Earl Derr Biggers  for a series of mystery novels. Biggers loosely based Chan on Hawaiian detective  Chang Apana . The benevolent and heroic Chan was conceived as an alternative to  Yellow Peril  stereotypes and villains like  Fu Manchu . Many stories feature Chan traveling the world beyond  Hawaii  as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes. Chan first appeared in Biggers' novels and then was featured in a number of media. Over four dozen  films  featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character, featured only as a supporting character, was first portrayed by East Asian actors, and the films met with little success. In 1931, for the first film centering on Chan,  Charlie Chan Carries On , the  Fox Film Corporation  cast  Swedish  actor  Warner Oland ; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce 15 more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland's death, American actor  Sidney Toler  was cast as Chan; Toler made 22 Chan films, first for Fox and then for  Monogram Studios . After Toler's death, six films were made, starring  Roland Winters .  ",
