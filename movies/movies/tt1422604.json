    "Plot": "North Britons have produced a lot of games that seem odd to outsiders: golf -- sometimes described as 'a good walk spoiled' -- caber tossing -- how far can you throw this log -- and such modern marvels as dwarf tossing and curling.Here, however, is one that didn't catch on. Two men sit on a post and pummel each other with pillows until one falls off. For some unexplained reason, the International Olympics Committee never followed this up.This Robert Paul production is shot very simply according to the constraints of the technology of the period: a still camera records two sets of pillow walloping for forty-five seconds. The camera was too heavy to move easily and the subject doesn't seem to warrant a second loop of film.",
