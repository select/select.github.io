    "Plot": "The man, a poor vagrant, is about to cast himself into the river when he is stopped and started upon the right road by the poor girl. He discovers his father is advertising to learn his whereabouts, returns home, is forgiven and finds a fortune at his command. Some time later he is engaged to the rich girl and a slumming party is made up one night. They visit Chinatown and pass the well-known bread line, at which the rich girl sneers and laughs. Realizing how little of real life she knows, the man, disgusted with the social whirl of her class, dons his old attire and wanders down by the river for a breath of fresh air. Here it is that the poor girl, more wretched and ragged than ever, comes to cast herself into the black waters. As she had saved him once, so now does he prevent her from carrying out her design, recognizes her and leads her tenderly to his beautiful home as his wife for all time.",
