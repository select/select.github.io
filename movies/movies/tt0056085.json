      "description": "From covered wagons to railroads - the pioneers conquer the New World. A star-studded, episodic Western epic about the settlement of America.. In five episodes, directors John Ford , George Marshall , and Henry Hathaway recount the Prescott family's journey westward. They follow their fortunes over three generations, from the raft crossing the Ohio River to the trek to California's gold country, from the Civil War to the construction of the railroad. Dozens of stars ( Gregory Peck , James Stewart , John Wayne , Henry Fonda , and others) appeared, 400 technicians were on duty, and five Native American tribes participated, including the elderly Red Cloud, who had fought General Custer at Little Big Horn. The film was shot in the rare Cinerama format, with three cameras recording one image simultaneously. The film became a box office hit and won three Oscars for editing, sound, and screenplay. Spencer Tracy as Narrator",
