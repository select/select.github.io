      "description": "Faced with the uncertainty of losing their own jobs, the film's two central characters are under constant pressure to sustain their livelihood. Set in the crumbling environs of Calcutta, Labour of Love is a lyrical unfolding of two ordinary lives suspended in the duress of a spiralling recession. They are married to a cycle of work and domestic routine, and long stretches of waiting in the silence of an empty house. They share each others solitude in pursuit of a distant dream that visits them briefly every morning. Labour of Love is set against the backdrop of a spiralling recession that hit India a few years back. Thousands of people lost their jobs without notice. Factories shut down and mills were locked. Faced with the uncertainty of losing their own jobs, the film's two central characters are under constant pressure to sustain their livelihood. But even in the face of adversity, they seem to possess a serene power and their demeanour helps display a strange, comforting calmness.\" [Aditya Vikram Sengupta] This Bengali-language film, although mostly devoid of dialogues, delicately draws you in little by little; at turn intriguing, unsettling, it is always beautiful. We find ourselves in Calcutta where the living is arduous even for those lucky enough to have a full-time job. The two main characters, a married couple, accept their lot with aplomb, showing an impressive resilience. But also love, the one enduring and irrepressible feeling when everything else in life seems so fragile. Quietly lyrical, this first film shows that truth can be found in the simplest, smallest, and most mundane acts of everyday life . Actors Ritwick Chakraborty and Basabdutta Chatterjee are perfectly cast as this brave young couple. [Agnès C. Poirier] ADITYA VIKRAM SENGUPTA (1983, Calcutta, India) studied literature at Calcutta University before specializing in Graphic Design at the National Institute of Design.
