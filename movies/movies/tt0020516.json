      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The Trial of Mary Dugan was the first sound picture for prolific actress Norma Shearer, and it was an  important success for her. This drama based on a play showed that she could not only lead a talkie, but that she was extremely suited for the format. Unfortunately, the plot was considered so risqué at the time that it was cited as one of the catalysts that led to the formation of the Hays Code.  Regrettably, the best copy of this film that I could find has numerous visual issues and suddenly cuts off at the end before the end card can be shown. Still, this is the highest quality version that I could find through my research. ",
