      "description": "PizzaFLIX Presents CLASSIC MOVIE MONDAY\nStars: Will Rogers, Irene Rich, Marguerite Churchill, Fifi D'Orsay\nDirector: Frank Borzage\n\nStep back in time with this pre-Code gem from Fox Film Corp, directed by Frank Borzage—an Oscar-winning filmmaker known for his heartfelt storytelling. The beloved Will Rogers stars as an American mechanic turned oilman who reluctantly journeys to Paris with his family, leading to culture clashes, social satire, and unforgettable moments abroad.\n\n Already a beloved humorist and vaudeville star, Rogers brought his signature wit and plainspoken charm to the screen just as Hollywood transitioned to sound. \n\nCo-starring Irene Rich and Owen Davis Jr., the film offers a humorous yet revealing look at American values abroad during the Jazz Age. Margaret Lawrence and Fifi D'Orsay round out the stellar cast, bringing charm and continental flair to this sharp, character-driven narrative.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This globe-trotting comedy is the talkie debut of star Will Rogers, as well as the first film ever for Fifi D'Orsay. The Film was successful enough to warrant a sequel in 1932, although with a very different tone, as the depression was in full swing at that point. ",

In the inevitable clash, will pretentiousness and sophistication or common sense triumph?",
