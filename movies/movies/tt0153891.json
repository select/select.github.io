    "Plot": "Under police grilling, the Wolf tells the sad tale of how he was hoodwinked by Red Riding Hood and beaten up by Granny in this amusing askew Terrytoon.Director Connie Rasinski's visual style here is a bit old-fashioned for Paul Terry's studio, but the version that the wolf tells, of being film-flammed and mauled, is excellent in its details, from the water-wings that Wolf wears to that always amusing comedy prop, the Murphy bed. The entire cartoon is cast so that the Wolf has a mildly fey quality and is well worth the time of anyone who likes 1930s cartoons.",
