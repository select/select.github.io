    "Plot": "I give this movie a 10 out of a movie with no subtitles... I found it with no subtitles and I still understood the movie. Any one that likes comedy movies will like this. Its a really cool, funny move. This movie is about 5 boys; Shun, Bon, Takuma, Haru, and Chu. They are middle school kids(sorry if this is not true)... All of them live a almost normal life... with the hard ships like love, heartbreaking, death, and playing funny jokes on the locals. This movie is called Pika*nchi: Life is hard dekedo happy which means Pika*nchi: Life is hard however happy... which well tell you little bit of the movie. In this movie the characters are played by famous J-Pop stars the band Arashi... a band like Nsync but much better music. Please email me if you want to know where to find the movie... Please look at this movie... it will make you laugh, cry, and say \"What's with the hair?\"",
