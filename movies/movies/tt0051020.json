      "description": "At a small, rural British lab, Dr. Laird (Alec Mango) and his assistants (Forrest Tucker, Gaby André) experiment with ultra-intense magnetic fields that can even affect distant objects. But the field it generates appears to contnue for a while even after the power is shut off. One night, a mistake causes a freak storm and a tidal wave, and deadly things start happening in the nearby woods. The newspaper suggests that it's the start of an invasion from some unknown \"Planet X\". Then a strange man (Martin Benson) appears from \"a long way off\", concerned about Laird's pulling down disaster from the skies. Fiddling with the Earth's magnetic field, it turns out, can mutate insects into giant monsters, even though they may not quite be \"cosmic\". Based on the novel by Rene Ray. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
