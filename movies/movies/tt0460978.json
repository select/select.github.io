      "description": "Synopsis As a New Zealander on a holiday in Iran, I was very lucky to be given a copy of Leila with sub-titles on it. This movie shows the trouble of of a young couples marriage, when it is found the women can not have children, and the subsequent pressure from the Husbands mother to take a second wife, as you can do in Iran. We see the pain the first wife has to endure. It shows an insight into a cutlure that is very different to our Western culture, and the audience becomes engrossed in the life of the young women, feeling her troubles along with her. -- IMDb Cast: Leila Hatami ....
