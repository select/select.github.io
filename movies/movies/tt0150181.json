    "Plot": "Oopie is to give a violin concert, but doesn't want to play. Scrappy gives him a stick of chewing gum, which calms him. However, the gum gets on the two of them.It's an amusing cartoon from an uncredited Sid Marcus. He was one of those long-lasting talents whose credits stretch from 1929, when he was 25, (or 32, according to some sources) until a few years before his death in 1986, or perhaps just before his death in 1979: the lack of agreement of sources indicates the indifference of people who are passionate about animation. He was a mainstay of Columbia cartoons in the 1930s, and of Depatie-Freleng in the 1970s. Always competent, never outstanding, he is perhaps the best known of the many people in the animation industry who labored in obscurity.",
