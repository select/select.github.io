The film was written by Carl Dudley and Philip MacDonald and was distributed by Republic Pictures . The film's storyline involves Dr. Ralph Harrison, who resigns his government post in protest against the inhumane treatment being inflicted upon spaceship pilots. His colleague, Professor Nordstrom, develops an alternative: a robot that he names \" Tobor \" (the reverse anagram of \"robot\"), which soon becomes a friend and playmate to Harrison's young son, \"Gadge\". Tobor is stolen by enemy agents, and only the two scientists' and Gadge's psychic link with the robot can save it from being reprogrammed and used for evil purposes against the United States.",
