      "description": "In the western based on a novel by Harold Robbins , Steve McQueen plays the role of an avenger. Three years earlier, Alan Ladd played Nevada Smith in \" The Carpetbaggers \" Although Steve McQueen , at 36, was already a bit too old for the role, the hard-hitting Western directed by Henry Hathaway became a veritable box office hit.   The film grossed a then-astonishing five million dollars. Incidentally, the name Nevada Smith served as a model for a later screen celebrity: Indiana Jones .",

The boy is taken in by a gun merchant. The gun merchant shows him how to shoot, to shoot on time, and to shoot straight. Everything that Nevada does goes to killing those three men. He learns to read and write just to learn their location. He pays people to tell him where they're at. He even goes to prison to kill one of them. While the movie is a Western and has plenty of action, it also takes a deep look into vengeance and how one can change after a haunting incident.",
