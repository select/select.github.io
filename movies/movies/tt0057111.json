      "description": "Goldilocks and The Three Bares  is a 1963  nudie-cutie  film from the legendary exploitation team of  Herschell Gordon Lewis  and  David F. Friedman . The title has absolutely nothing to do with the famous fable which inspired the title. Appropriately billed as the \"first nudist musical\" (not to be confused with  The First Nudie Musical , 1976), it has considerably more depth than their prior attempts at this genre. (from wikipedia) Oldbones found no registration for this 1963 outing.",
