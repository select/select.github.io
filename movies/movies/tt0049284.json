    "Plot": "Teddy, the daughter of a very prominent family, is released to them by the juvenile authorities. Teddy is out to get revenge on the very bad community and starts her own girl gang, who seduce, waylay and rob male victims. Joe is a fence-and-receiver of stolen goods and provides the girls with guns and encouragement to rob a warehouse. The bad girls are very bad when doing it, fail it, and are forced to hide out. Joy Jenkins, who has been intimate with Joe, learns that he is two-timing her, with Trixie the Tricking Tart, and confronts him with the fact that she is pregnant. He brushes her off and she promptly shoots him fatally as Joy doesn't want to be an unwed mother. Meanwhile, Teddy and Dumb Dora Jones steal a car and make a break for a hideout in the country but they are spotted by the police. In the car chase, Teddy's car crashes, Teddy is killed outright and Dora dies in a hospital. City life goes on as normal.",
