Shaken, she leaves and later tells her girlfriend about the incident. The girlfriend insists that she invite the fortune-teller to a party they're having at her house. What the woman doesn't realize is that the \"fortune-teller\" is actually the ex-husband she abandoned years ago, when she took their daughter and ran off with her lover. When the \"charlatan\" is invited to the party, he sees an opportunity to take his revenge on his faithless ex-wife.",
