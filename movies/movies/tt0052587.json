      "description": "When shipping starts mysteriously disappearing on routes across the Arctic Sea, a submarine is equipped with a special deep exploration device and sent to investigate. What they discover is an extraterrestrial craft, which may be too powerful for even their most sophisticated weapons. Arthur Franz as Lt. Cmdr. Richard 'Reef' Holloway Dick Foran as Cmdr. Dan Wendover Brett Halsey as Dr. Carl Neilson Jr. Tom Conway as Sir Ian Hunt Paul Dubov as Lt. David Milburn Bob Steele as CPO 'Grif' Griffin Victor Varconi as Dr. Clifford Kent Joi Lansing as Julie Sid Melton as Yeoman Chester Tuttle I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
