    "Plot": "No one expected that a back-woods, rural school district in Northeastern Ohio's Appalachia region would achieve the academic success that it has. After all, these are the '922ers,' the kids from Claymont. Many people call it 'Dirtmont,' or 'Scaggville.' 'Dial 911 if you're in trouble. Dial 922 if you're looking for trouble.' The stigma continues, even now. Of the student population, 60% come from single-parent homes, 63% receive free and reduced meals, and the Special Needs population of the District exceeds 30%. Five years ago inspiration arrived, new Superintendent, Ryan Delaney. He replaced 27% of the staff, helped alter beliefs, practices, patterns and created a new culture. The district has numerous Schools of Excellence, Blue Ribbon Schools, and Schools of Promise. 922 - From Academic Watch to Academic WOW!",
