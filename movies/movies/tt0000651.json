This is the earliest surviving film with Robert Harron that we have. He was one month short of 15 y.o. Robert Harron plays the messenger boy, as was often the case in his first roles. Thus, we can glance at the humble beginning of his illustrious career, which would take him to star roles in such masterpieces as \"Intolerance\" (1916) and \"True Heart Susie\" (1919), to mention just a couple.
