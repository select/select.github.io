    "Plot": "The uncle of Josephine employs gangsters to abduct her, and in fleeing from them she enters a motion picture theater, where she sees Maciste playing in the screen drama, \"Cabiria.\" The story pictures Maciste escaping from prison by bending iron bars, and Josephine decides that a man of his strength can be of much assistance to her. She obtains his address, and going to him she relates her experience. At first he is inclined to doubt the truthfulness of her story, but later, when he sees half a dozen ruffians attacking her, he intercedes in the girl's behalf, and single handed subdues them. Maciste demonstrates his marvelous strength in many other thrilling incidents, and finally runs down the uncle and his gang, and turns them over to the authorities.",
