      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: Unsatisfied with MGM’s first two Tarzan films, novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs decided not to renew his contract. Instead, he co-founded Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises with Ashton Dearholt for the filming of THE NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN. He aimed to stay true to his novel’s portrayal of Tarzan as a cultured and well-educated gentleman, which he succeeded. Burroughs also sought greater financial returns, which he did not, and he was soon back with MGM.  \n\nStars: Bruce Bennett, Ula Holt, Ashton Dearholt\nWriter: Edgar Rice Burroughs (novel)\n\nTarzan goes to Guatemala to find his lost friend, D'Arnot. On the way, he helps Major Matling search Mayan ruins for hidden jewels and an idol containing the formula for a powerful explosive. D'Arnot and the idol are rescued, but the idol falls into the clutches of the explorer Raglan.\n\nTRIVIA: During the film’s production in Guatemala, producer Ashton Dearholt married the lead actress Ula Holt, and Burroughs broke up with his wife to marry Dearholt's ex-wife Florence Gilbert.",

It contains both a fortune in jewels and an ancient formula for a super-explosive which could threaten world safety in the wrong hands. From Africa, Major Martling and Ula Vale launch separate expeditions to find the Goddess and place its secrets in safe hands. Ula's fiance died in an earlier attempt at the same goal and she has taken up the trail in his memory against the advice of her lawyer, Hiram Powers, who covets the Goddess for himself and sends Raglan, a mercenary, to get it for him. Aboard their ship to Guatemala is Lord Greystoke - aka Tarzan - on a mission to find his old friend, d'Arnot, whose plane crashed in the vicinity of the same lost city. Tarzan joins forces with Martling, and they reach the lost city in time to save d'Arnot, but lose the Goddess to Raglan. Ula joins Tarzan and Martling in pursuit of Raglan, whence they must contend with the perils of the jungle, Raglan's henchmen, and a party of primitives from the lost city sent to retrieve the Goddess...",
