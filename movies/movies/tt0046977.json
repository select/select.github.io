      "description": "\"Fire Maidens of Outer Space\" is a 1956 British science fiction film directed by Cy Roth. The story revolves around a group of astronauts who journey to the planet Krypton after receiving a distress signal from an earlier expedition. Upon arrival, they discover a civilization of beautiful women who are the last survivors of a once-thriving society. The women are led by a character named Mona , who reveals that they are threatened by a malevolent force known as Kronos . Although it received mixed to negative reviews, Fire Maidens of Outer Space has gained a cult following due to its kitschy elements, including awkward dialogues and costumes, which make it a fun watch for fans of vintage sci-fi.",
