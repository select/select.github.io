    "Plot": "The film takes place in a small town where 72 % of the people who live there are Black, 10 % are Hispanic, 4 % are Asian and the remaining residents are primarily White. While this is the make up of those who live there, with the exception of a few black officers the local police force is predominately white. But sadly, and as is the case in many communities of color, nearly all of those who have been shot and killed by the police are unarmed minority men, women and now more than ever young children, most of whom posed little or no real threat to the officers. While simultaneously dealing with the fact that his grandmother is suffering from dementia and more and more of these cop shootings, 12 year old Jason Mckey whose character is played by new comer Jamol Manigault, looks to his uncle for help, his uncle then seeks to acquire the services of Always Best to assist with the in home Care and comforting of the woman Jason affectionately calls Mom Mom. After a young boy with whom he attended elementary school becomes the latest casualty, Jason realizes that the marching and protesting have done little to nothing to curb these shootings, and decides to approach his uncle whose best friend Samatha Brooks whose character is played by veteran actress Vivica A. Fox, as the city manager and advisor to the city counsel. After agreeing to help, she succeeds in getting him in front of the council to officially present his letter and petition, which contains multiple solutions to these shootings, some of which are controversial but for him, a last resort to stopping the unjustified killings, all of which have gone unpunished.",
