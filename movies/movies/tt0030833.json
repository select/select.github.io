      "title": "Tarzan’s Revenge (1938) | Colorized Public Domain Jungle Adventure | Glenn Morris and Eleanor Holm",
      "description": "Tarzan’s Revenge (1938) is an American jungle adventure film directed by D. Ross Lederman and produced by Sol Lesser. This restored and colorized public domain edition brings back one of the most unique takes on Edgar Rice Burroughs’ legendary character. Released in the late 1930s, the film starred Olympic gold medalist Glenn Morris in his only screen appearance as Tarzan, alongside swimming champion Eleanor Holm in her first and only leading role. Unlike other Tarzan adaptations, this movie carries a distinctive blend of romance, colonial adventure, and athletic spectacle. Now brought to modern audiences in color, it can be appreciated both as a campy piece of cinematic history and a fascinating snapshot of pre-war Hollywood filmmaking.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe story follows Tarzan (Glenn Morris), the famed jungle hero who encounters Eleanor Reed (Eleanor Holm), a visiting American on a family safari in Africa. Eleanor’s wealthy family is traveling with her fiancé, Nevin Potter (George Meeker), and her father, Roger Reed (George Barbier). During their expedition, they are threatened by a villainous sheik, Ben Alleu Bey (C. Henry Gordon), who desires Eleanor for his harem. Tarzan rescues her multiple times, leading to a bond that blossoms into romance. The film plays out as a mix of thrilling rescues, jungle chases, and exotic spectacle, with Tarzan using both brute strength and cunning to protect Eleanor from danger.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: D. Ross Lederman\n• Producer: Sol Lesser\n• Screenplay: Robert Lee Johnson\n• Cinematography: George Meehan\n• Editing: Gene Milford\n\nStarring:\n• Glenn Morris as Tarzan\n• Eleanor Holm as Eleanor Reed\n• George Meeker as Nevin Potter\n• George Barbier as Roger Reed\n• Hedda Hopper as Penny Reed\n• C. Henry Gordon as Ben Alleu Bey\n• Joe Sawyer as Olaf Punch\n\nFilm Significance:\nTarzan’s Revenge is one of the lesser-known entries in the Tarzan film canon, notable for casting Olympic athletes instead of established Hollywood stars. Glenn Morris, gold medal decathlete at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, was promoted as a natural choice for the role of Tarzan, though this became his only film. Eleanor Holm, Olympic swimming champion, also made her sole starring role here. The movie reflects 1930s Hollywood’s fascination with exotic adventure stories and the blending of athletic stardom with cinematic spectacle. Although critically mixed at release, the film endures as a cultural curiosity, embodying the era’s pulp adventure style.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.

After the success of MGM's big-budget Tarzan starring Johnny Weissmuller, Lesser cashed in with TARZAN THE FEARLESS (1933) casting Olympic swimmer Buster Crabbe. He sold his rights for 3 films to MGM, but Lesser produced TARZAN'S REVENGE (1938,) casting yet another Olympian Glenn Morris as the Ape Man.",
