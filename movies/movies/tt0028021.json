      "description": "A critical and popular triumph,  Osaka Elegy  established Mizoguchi as one of Japan’s major filmmakers. The director's often-used leading actress Isuzu Yamada stars as Ayako, a switchboard operator trapped in a compromising, ruinous relationship with her boss to help support her wastrel father. With its fluid cinematography and deft storytelling,  Osaka Elegy  ushered in a new era of sound melodrama for Mizoguchi.",
