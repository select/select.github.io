      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Joan Crawford's first non-musical talking role; she stars as a young woman who grew up with her father exploring the jungles of South America. Now, as an adult, she has to return to New York and learn a new set of cultural rules. Reviews were mixed on release, but box office returns were excellent for this little romantic dramedy. ",
