      "description": "Sadly the only thing available are just a few fragments running just over a minute. Since there aren't any title cards it's going to be important for the viewer to already know the story. However, with that said, even if you do know the story then it might be hard to pick up on what's actually going on. The first scene has Crusoe fighting off some men coming after him. The second scene has him in a cottage just sitting around. I'm not sure how much of this movie is missing or if it was originally an \"epic\" like A TRIP TO THE MOON but at least the studio included it on the release. It's hard to judge the film in its current state but hopefully the full thing will show up at some point. - 25 August 2011 | by Michael_Elliott (Louisville, KY) Director: Georges Méliès Writer: Daniel Defoe (novel) Country: France Runtime: 1 min (fragment) Sound Mix: Silent Color: Black and White Release Date: USA 7 March 1903 Also Known As (AKA) Les Aventures de Robinson Crusoé France (original title) Robinson Crusoe USA Robinson Crusoe kalandjai Hungary",
