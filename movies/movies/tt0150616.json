    "Plot": "The copy I saw, labeled \"The Forty Theves\" like the IMDb listing, showed up on the screen as \"The Forty Thieves\". Still, it was the 1960s reissue, so it might have been \"corrected\", Or not. All those editions, which played on CBS, timed in at under six minutes, while such times as appear elsewhere indicate that in the 1930s, Terrytoons were a full reel, eight or nine minutes.That may be wrong, or it might account for the disjointed nature of the version I saw, which has Ali Baba (I guess) flying in on his magic carpet to rescue his princess from the human caliph. There are some interesting gags, but it had the lack of timing and sophistication of the Mighty Mouse cartoons I saw in the same era.",
