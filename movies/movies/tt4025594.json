The gig: kill the black-finned shark that swallowed a valuable diamond during a gang transaction. Enlisted to keep an eye on Chase is Jake’s girlfriend, Jasmine. But Chase and Jasmine’s relationship deepens with the threats from a rival crime boss: bring the diamond to him or die. Soon, loyalties will shift, and Chase will learn that trusting in blood is for suckers. Now, it’s crime boss against crime boss, brother against brother, and man against nature, as Chase strives to rescue Jasmine, save his own life, and track down the great black-finned shark that will be the greatest challenge of his career.\n\nStarring Derek Theler, Erica Cerra, Arnold Vosloo, Neels Van Jaarsveld\n2014\n\nDirected by Sheldon Wilson\n\r\nMORE Popcornflix MOVIES, FREE on YouTube!\r\n\r\n Action: https://bit.ly/2XC8pvv\r\n Romance: https://bit.ly/2NVnIQ2\r\n Horror: https://bit.ly/2LeNNaK\r\n Crime: https://bit.ly/2NK201z\r\n Drama: https://bit.ly/2G6Uasy\r\n Comedy:  https://bit.ly/2LPCNQD\r\n Western: https://bit.ly/2S7FRc4\r\n Popcornflix Channel page: https://bit.ly/2Saak9p\r\n\r\nWatch more free movies and TV series at Popcornflix.com, or on the Popcornflix app available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Chromecast, and AppleTV.\r\n\r\n#Popcornflix, Full length free movies and TV series.\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Popcornflix\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Popcornflixnews\r\nPopcornflix is owned/operated by Screen Media Ventures",
