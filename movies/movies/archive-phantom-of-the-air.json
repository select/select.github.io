      "description": "After inventing an anti-gravity device, a scientist (William Desmond) and his daughter (Gloria Shea) recruit a pilot (Tom Tyler) to demonstrate it in action. But the unscupulous leader of a ring of smugglers (LeRoy Mason), pretending to be a friend, tries to sabotage the plane and steal the invention. Tom Tyler as Captain Bob Raymond Gloria Shea as Mary Edmonds LeRoy Mason as Mortimer Crome William Desmond as Thomas Edmonds Sidney Bracey as James Munson Craig Reynolds as Blade I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
