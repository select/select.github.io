      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first full length Technicolor film that included a musical soundtrack, The Viking wasn't content to be only a technical exhibition. This big budget spectacle unfortunately came out a little too late to be fully appreciated, as audiences were already enthralled by the introduction of films with talking and singing.",

On the way he vies for the love of Helga with his companion Egil and Alwin, an English slave. More conflict arises when he stops at the colony of his father (Eric the Red) in Greenland, for Leif has converted to Christianity, which his father hates. He also has to deal with the unrest of his crew, who fear falling off the edge of the Earth.",
