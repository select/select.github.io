      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first full length Technicolor film that included a musical soundtrack, The Viking wasn't content to be only a technical exhibition. This big budget spectacle unfortunately came out a little too late to be fully appreciated, as audiences were already enthralled by the introduction of films with talking and singing.",
