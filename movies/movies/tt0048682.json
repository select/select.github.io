      "description": "Swamp Women, produced in 1955, was the first film ever directed by Roger Corman. The film follows undercover police officer Lee Hampton after she infiltrates a prison, befriends three female convicts, and helps them all escape. In reality, this planned escape is part of a larger plot to find a diamond stash hidden deep within the swamps of Louisiana. This is a fairly poor quality copy of the movie, with film splicing of a different print evident from 1:00:30 to 1:00:59 This film is in the public domain.",
