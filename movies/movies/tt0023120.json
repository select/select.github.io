Montana, on his horse Dynamite, and his pal Pancho Gonzales, stop the Lopez' runaway carriage when the Riders attack them. \"Lazy Y\" foreman Buck Daggett hires Montana and Pancho, but they go to work for Don Roberto Lopez, at his El Rio Rancho, based on their reputation as gunmen. There, Montana courts the daughter of Lopez, Rosita, with Pancho giving him pointers in Spanish. El Rio foreman Tex Barnes, who secretly works for \"Cash\" Hopton, the instigator behind all of the trouble and the night riders, kills Steve and lays the blame on Montana. With a bit of help, Montana escapes and cleans up the gang of land grabbers. Julian Rivero sings \"I Love You For a Song.\"",
