      "description": "The Rokin is an important thoroughfare in Amsterdam. Between 1933 and 1936, the canal on the Rokin (between the Spui and the Dam) was filled in in two stages. This film shows the situation before damping and during the first phase. It is especially fascinating to see how an older man controls a small ferry (also called a vulture ferry) that travels the short distance from shore to shore via a steel cable. The side of the ferry says \"Turmac\", advertising for a cigarette brand. It is surprising how little can be found about this ferry on the Internet. As far as can be determined, the creation of parking spaces was the only reason why the municipal council decided to fill in the canal. That the muted part was used well for this purpose is clearly visible in this film. In recent years, Rokin was the scene of the construction of the North-South metro line. The construction went far from without problems. Serious subsidence occurred, causing damage to the buildings along the Rokin. In recent years, calls have been made to restore the old canal to its former glory, but to date these plans have been successfully opposed by local entrepreneurs. Another film on this channel shows a liberation parade in 1945 (in colour) on the Rokin. Source of original B/W films: Sound and Vision Music: Johannes Bornlof.",
