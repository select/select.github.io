      "description": "“Imperfect movie” “Dreadful, mannered and dull” “Perfectly boring” (IMDB reviews quotes). Aging Gloria Swanson’s self-financed failed attempt to survive as a romantic leading lady and young Laurence Olivier’s emergence as a romantic leading man: Which are the most interesting aspects of this muddled film that doesn’t know if it’s a comedy, a melodrama or a travelogue. Also its timing couldn't have been worse. It was released during the absolute depths of the Depression on both sides of the Atlantic when the romantic foibles of the idle rich and their drunken motor boat races weren't likely to gain many fans.  However a good supporting cast and excellent production values make this trans-Atlantic curiosity worth watching. Produced in the UK with an Anglo-American cast. IMDB rating 6.9. Directed by Cyril Gardner. Released in 1933 (UK & US). Complete Print. ",
