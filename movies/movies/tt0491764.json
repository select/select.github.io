      "description": "Earthstorm | Free Action Sci-Fi Disaster Movie | Full Free Movie | Stephen Baldwin\n\nAn asteroid hits the Moon, causing fissures in its crust and sends a chunk hurtling toward Earth. Even worse is the threat that larger pieces will break off which could obliterate whole cities on impact! With the Moon out of sync, strange weather and huge tidal waves are threatening the population. Scientists conclude the only solution is to set nuclear charges on the Moon to implode it and keep it whole. The man for the job is demolitions expert, John Redding. Can he succeed in placing the charges correctly before an even larger piece threatens civilization?\n\n2006.  Stars: Stephen Baldwin, Amy Price-Francis, John Ralston\n*Licensed from Vision Films. All rights reserved*\n\n*Review* - \"Earthstorm\" (2006) is an action-packed sci-fi disaster movie full of explosive action, apocalyptic danger, and heroic excess. When a massive asteroid strikes the Moon, it breaks apart, showering deadly debris on Earth and endangering total planetary destruction. As tidal waves build, the weather turns volatile, and the planet teeters in the balance, a desperate solution is hatched—explode nuclear bombs on the Moon to keep it from disintegrating. Enter John Redding (Stephen Baldwin), a demolition expert somehow better prepared than all of NASA's group of specialists. Defying incredible odds, he embarks on the formidable challenge of saving the world from lunar destruction. With frenetic action, cheeseball dialogue, and old-fashioned made-for-TV disaster spectacularism, Earthstorm is a thrilling ride for any doomsday film fan, and asteroid apocalypse movie fan.\n\n*Welcome to Movie Central, SUBSCRIBE NOW!* - https://bit.ly/3mRDJox\n*MORE FREE MOVIES  on YouTube!* - \n🌟 Free Action Movies: https://bit.ly/3uMwRxq\n🌟 Free Sci-Fi Movies: https://bit.ly/3o3lLAm\n🌟 Free Horror Movies: https://bit.ly/3aBBt2J\n🌟 Free Asylum Movies: https://bit.ly/3cipzeI\n🌟 Free Crime/Thriller: https://bit.ly/3o01prJ\n🌟 Free Drama Movies: https://bit.ly/3Pu4mN9\n🌟 Free Comedy Movies: https://bit.ly/3IE0wPd\n🌟 Free Western Movies: https://bit.ly/3RqTX6u\n🌟 Free Adventure Movies: https://bit.ly/3yHolAT\n🌟 MOVIE CENTRAL Channel: https://bit.ly/3o27Fze\n\n** All of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.
