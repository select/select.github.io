      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Douglas Fairbanks crime adventure follows an antihero criminal who decides to fight against a cruel usurper of a local village. Box office returns were solid and reviews highlighted the against-type role of the Gaucho. Still, financial returns were not quite as strong as Fairbanks' previous films such as the Thief of Baghdad or The Black Pirate. ",
