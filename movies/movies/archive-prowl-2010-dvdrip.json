      "description": "Amber is a teenage girl feeling out of place, dreaming to move to \"The Windy City\" - Chicago. She seeks every opportunity to get away. Convinces all her friends to take a road trip, to look at an apartment that's being held off the market for her sake by an acquaintance. But the car breaks down, making her stressed out about the deadline; to be there, with cash, in less than 20 hours, if she doesn't want the apartment given away to another bidder.",
