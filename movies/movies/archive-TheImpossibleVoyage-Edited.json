      "description": "This is a bit of an experiment. As fans of silent films will know Georges Melies was restricted to an immobile camera so his films are really a series of short scenes like small plays. He did fill these scenes with people and activity though. I decided to see what I could do with one of these films by imposing zooms, pans etc along with music and sounds. I only wish the quality of the original had been better and will try this again with another Melies film. Remember, this is NOT meant to be a substitute for the original, but simply a film experiment. Write a comment and let me know what you think.",
