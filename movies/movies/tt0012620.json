      "description": "Rhythmus 21 is a short, black and white silent film by Hans Richter released in 1921. In the beginning of the century, the coexistence of sound, color and movements in the same artwork was still on an experimental level. One of the first samples of such a work was Hans Richter's Rhythmus 21 (1921), a three minute film where the musical and the visual part are intrinsically connected between them, amplifying thus the impact of the work on the viewer. The image captures oneâs attention immediately: geometrical shapes -white rectangulars in black background or the opposite- move and change color and shape, size and place as they follow the rhythm and the melody of the music. For the highest quality it is recommended you download the source .mkv file and play with VLC Player . IMDB Link ~~~ For free electronic music, check out Karakasa Music!",
