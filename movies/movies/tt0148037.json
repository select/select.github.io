    "Plot": "Van Bueren Studios' Cubby the Bear series comprised of just 19 (not the 17 as initially thought, having worked from an incomplete list listing the cartoons) cartoons made between 1933-1934. As much as it pains me to say it, speaking as a big animation fan, it is not hard to see why the character and the series weren't so popular and didn't last long.Despite my love for animation, there are just a few above mediocre Cubby cartoons, such as 'The Nut Factory', 'Fresh Ham', 'Croon Crazy' and 'Goode Knight'. 'Cubby's Stratosphere Flight' is one of Cubby's better cartoons, having some good supporting characters and some nice energy in the second half, but generally doesn't fly enough. The best thing about it, and this is true of a lot of Van Bueren's output, is the music score. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and full of lively energy that is lacking elsewhere, doing so well with enhancing the action. The energy in the second half is lively, while the traffic cop and the walrus quartet fare best of the characters (though the former doesn't have a lot to do).Some neat synchronisation and the igloo speakeasy is a fun setting and the excitement of its atmosphere is done well.However, the animation generally is really not good even for a cartoon not made on a high budget, and it is true for the Cubby the Bear series and Van Bueren in general on the whole. It's static in movement, simplistic in background detail and sloppy in drawing, with the character expressions being pretty expressionless.Another major problem is Cubby himself, on top of being poorly animated he is one of the blandest, most personality-deprived there is and is in a role that stronger characters like Mickey Mouse could easily have filled better. His girlfriend is just as bland and charmless, more so than the girlfriends of Buddy and Bosko. Generally the supporting characters are engaging enough but doesn't have enough to do.'Cubby's Stratosphere Flight' doesn't have enough laughs and what there is don't feel absurdist (the general kind of humour from Van Bueren) enough. The story is formulaic when it's present and generally is very thin on it, which shows in the lack of momentum in the first half.Overall, one of Cubby's better cartoons but apart from some obvious good things it's rather average. 5/10 Bethany Cox",
