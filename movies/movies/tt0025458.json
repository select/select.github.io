    "Plot": "Popeye the sailor navigates his ship through the seas, up onto dry land and through the city streets, finally parking it in front of Olive's house. Olive's mother delivers the sad news that Popeye's girl has run off with a \"daring young man on the flying trapeze.\" Three boys, who worship the pop-eyed sailor as a hero, try to cheer him up, but it does no good. Popeye takes the boys and their cat to the circus, where he watches not only this daring young man perform, but also Olive Oyl herself. It seems she did more than run off with him; she became part of the act. She's clearly unhappy in her new role. Popeye comes to the rescue.",
