      "description": "This portrait of female volunteer workers at an optics plant during World War II, shot on location at the Nippon Kogaku factory, was created with a patriotic agenda. Yet thanks to Akira Kurosawa’s groundbreaking semidocumentary approach,  The Most Beautiful  is a revealing look at Japanese women of the era and anticipates the aesthetics of Japanese cinema’s postwar social realism.",
