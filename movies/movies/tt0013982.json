    "Plot": "With a little bit of capital (specifically fifty cents) the gang is able to set up a lemonade stand and an adjoining hot dog stand near a race track. Mary stops by for some lemonade, while nearly charming the boys out of their socks. As the daughter of a horse owner, she manages to sneak them inside the track to watch the race. The whole thing is terribly exciting; and it gives Mickey an idea. The gang quickly abandons the idea of selling food and drink. Instead, they create their own race track. Of course, their own derby day is not quite like the adult version. Instead of horses, one boy has a cow, another a mule; a third rides in cart driven by a goat and a fourth in a dog-driven cart. Farina, whose vehicle is a tricycle, spikes the water of some of the animals beforehand. Before the race is through, the animals will be too drunk, lazy or overworked to finish. The horse race becomes a foot race.",
