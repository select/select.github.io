      "description": "A wealthy man offers a million dollars to whoever captures Adolf Hitler dead or alive. A group of gangsters take him up on this offer and after hijacking a Canadian Air Force plane are dropped into Germany. Their delusions about Hitler being just another cheap crook are shattered when they discover that knocking off Hitler wouldn't necessarily bring about the end of the war and they must decide what's more important: lining their pocketbooks or letting the military do their job.",
