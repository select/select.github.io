      "description": "This print is sharper and brighter than the existing IA copy. Yes this is that infamous mix of new sound footage of two guys in gorilla suits with footage from the silent serial \"Perils of the Jungle\" (1927), and as such a genuine jaw-dropper that must be seen to be believed. So bad it's good? Absolutely! ..er, well, at least it's hilariously bad. Directed by Harry L Fraser (as H L Fraser) Released in 1945. Complete print. CAST NOTE: B-western actor Ray \"Crash\" Corrigan who plays the sound-footage lead (Steve Collins) also is Konga the white gorilla in all but two scenes. In fact Corrigan was Hollywood's go-to guy for gorilla suit action, appearing as phony apes in more than a dozen films. MORE: Another mind-boggling and unintentionally hilarious mix of sound and silent footage is the 12-chapter serial \"Queen of the Jungle,\" which is here at IA in the Feature Films Collection.",
