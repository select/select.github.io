      "description": "The hotshot newspaper reporter Wallace Cook (Fredric March) tries to get in the good graces of his boss, Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly) by exploiting the \"imminent\" death of an ailing young woman, Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard). By way of newsprint the doomed young lady becomes the toast of New York City until her health situation is revealed as a hoax. IMHO one of the best comedies that went into Public Domain. The funny story telling by William A. Wellman and the great cast makes this one an highly enjoyable A Class Movie. If you watch the movie carefully you`ll notice that William Wellman tries to took the already pretty face of Carole Lombard and place it into an high contrast frame which makes her face and mimic even more enjoyable to watch like in this take for example or when she`s wearing the Uniform of the NYC Firebrigade Nice idea and Chapo Mr. Wellman",

    "Plot": "Hazel Flagg of Warsaw, Vermont receives the news that her terminal case of radium poisoning from a workplace incident was a complete misdiagnosis with mixed emotions. She is happy not to be dying, but she, who has never traveled the world, was going to use the money paid to her by her factory to go to New York in style. She believes her dreams can still be realized when Wally Cook arrives in town. He is a New York reporter with the Morning Star newspaper. He believes that Hazel's valiant struggle concerning her impending death is just the type of story he needs to resurrect his name within reporting circles after a recent story he wrote led to scandal and a major demotion at the newspaper. He proposes to take Hazel to New York both to report on her story but also to provide her with a grand farewell to life. She accepts. Wally's story results in Hazel becoming the toast of New York. In spending time together, Wally and Hazel fall in love. Hazel not only has to figure out what to do about her relationship with Wally, but also how to conclude her now very public story, which all of New York expects will be a public and imminent death. Others, however, may conclude the story for her.",
