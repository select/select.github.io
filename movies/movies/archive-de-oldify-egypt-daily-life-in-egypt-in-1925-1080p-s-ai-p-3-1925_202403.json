      "description": "This film shows how Egyptians go about their daily lives nearly a century ago. It can be concluded that the way they cultivate their land hardly has changed since the time of the pharao's, especially when observing murals from that period. Even in present day Egypt most farming activities still take place in largely the same way. This film has been meticulously restored, enhanced and colorized by means of modern video software tools based on Artificial Intelligence. Source: Archive.org Music: Soliman Gamil - Egyption Nile Music and Omar Faruk - Egyptian Dance.",
