    "Plot": "After watching Akira Kurosawa's terrific (co-) directing debut Uma (1941-also reviewed) I decided to end the viewings for the night by watching a short. Finding in a list of 1929 French films a obscure title starring Michel Simon,I got set for some private moves.Note:Review contains some plot details.View on the film:The lone non- documentary title he would make, director Andre Sauvage brings the same eye for capturing in the moment action of documentaries to fiction,with Sauvage wonderfully gliding the camera towards Pivoine sleeping by the sea edge of the docks, to tilting forward to eye Macaroni and Georgette's flirty bond.Pulling at the beard which would eventually lead to Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932-also reviewed)Michel Simon gives a great turn as Pivoine , whose scruffy appearance Simon shakes with a bohemian swagger down the docks near Notre Dame.",
