      "description": "Vladik Zorich, crime lord whose tentacles permeate the underbelly of a seedy Los Angeles as he deals in guns, gambling, drugs and skin trafficking, finds himself double-crossed by his most trusted operative Rhona Zyocki. Vladik’s propensity for power, control, and violence drives him to kidnap Rhona’s young daughter. To insure her daughter’s release, Rhona is forced to participate in a planned elimination of Vladik’s enemies and allies. As her daughter’s life hangs in the balance, Rhona  struggles  to  find  and eliminate  Vladik’s  most  violent and twisted enemies and retrieve valuable goods and information, all in one fateful night. To  keep her on a short leash, Vladik sets out  the  “rules”  to his “game” and oversees Rhona’s  every move as she navigates the darkened streets of Los Angeles. However, Vladik underestimates the power of a mother’s love — and finds himself losing control as his devious plan slowly unravels.\n2019.
