Years later, Slick Latimer and Bradley Meredith arrive looking for a diamond mine, and Bradley kills his brother and takes his place. The disgruntled Shamba teams up with them and attempts to kill Nyoka, Meredith's now-grown-up daughter, to obtain the amulet he believes is the secret of Dr. Meredith's power to cure the natives' ills. But good guys Jack Stanton and Curly Rogers have also arrived, and join Nyoka in trying to stop the villains. 15-chapter cliffhanger serial.

Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
