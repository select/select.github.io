    "Plot": "Astronauts Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt and Ronald Evans were the three brave men chosen to fly NASA's final mission. They have been written up in history books and acknowledged by the space and scientific communities, but have never received the public recognition they truly deserved. Apollo 17's voyage to the moon was the crowning glory of man's lunar exploration. This documentary features spectacular NASA footage and exclusive interviews with space scientists who worked on the Apollo program during the 60's and 70's. This is the remarkable story of the determination and courage of a generation. A tribute to three brave astronauts and the thousands of men and women behind them during the final days of NASA's Apollo program.",
