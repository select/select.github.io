      "description": "Porky, his girlfriend Petunia and Porky's nephew Pinkie head to the country to have a picnic. Naughty little Pinkie plays all sorts of cruel tricks on Porky by pulling the sidecar's pin, taking scissors to a squirrel and bashing his uncle. However, everything happens out of Petunia's sight. The day heads even further south in a hurry once the under supervised kid heads over to the nearby zoo. In a dizzying climax, Porky must retrieve the child from various animals' cages. Pinkie finally gets into trouble, getting a dose of his own medicine in the end. This is a Computer Colorized version from 1995.",
