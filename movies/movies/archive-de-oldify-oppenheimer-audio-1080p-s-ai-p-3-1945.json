      "description": "This film shows original B&W footage about the activities in the New Mexico dessert to develop an atomic weapon.  The film footage has been meticulously restored, enhanced and colorized to give a better view of what really went on there in 1945.  In brief: this was a secret project under the name \"the Manhattan project\" and was lead by physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer under military supervision in the person of General Leslie Groves. In order for hundreds of scientists to be as active and motivated as possible, an new small town was constructed in the dessert at Los Alamos, where they could live with their entire family. For those who recently watched Christopher Nolan's great Oppenheimer film, it may not have been totally clear that in fact two bombs were in the making: An implosion-type A-bomb and a Gun-type A-bomb. For both bombs enough enriched weaponized plutonium and uranium-235 needed to be produced respectively. The film shows two glass bowls, a fish bown and a large wine glass, that were gradually filled with marbles to represent the ongoing production progress. The contents of the larger bowl represented what was required for the \"Little Boy\" bomb and the smaller bowl for the Trinity so called \"Gadget\" test. Far more uranium was needed than plutonium. The actual Trinity test took place at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, about 200 km South of Los Alamos. This facility is now part of the White Sands Missile Range. It is remarkable to note that Japan was bombed only 20 and 23 days after the one and only (successful) Trinity test conducted on 16 July 1945. At the time of that test there was hardly anymore nuclear material available. Astonishingly  The Gun-type \"Little Boy\" bomb, that was dropped on Hiroshima, was deployed untested! This was done out of pure necessity in view of having run out of uranium.  The \"Fat Man\" bomb, that was dropped on Nagasaki, was of the same type as the one used during the Trinity test, i.e. an implosion-type bomb. The scarcety of uranium and the time needed to produce sufficient materials, makes one also wonder how viable the USA's threat to execute a “rain of ruin” on the Japanese cities, if they did not surrender,  would have been. Considering that the Gun-type bomb was much simpler to construct than the implosion bomb, a good question is why the latter type was persued nevertheless, especially considering the enormous time pressure that rested on the entire project. Probably a case of not wanting to bet just on one horse, plus the advantage of the far more easy production of the required plutonium isotope. Looking at these images, some may think that the Trinity bomb was cruedly held together with ducktape. However, tape was used to protect the contact sockets from dessert dust and sand until the bomb had been hoisted into the mast after which the cables and plugs were connected to the very complex detonation control units. In view of the level of development of electronics in 1945, the electronic control of the bomb was an astonishing achievement. To need the bomb to work, 32 high explosive detonator modules, that were mounted around a solid plutonium core, needed to fire inwards at exactly the same time in order to compress the core. The shock wave needed to hit the fissionable core with a precision of microseconds. Till this day Truman's decision to deploy nuclear weapons is highly controversial. Historians claim that one of the more important reasons to do so was to impress the Russians, who were also rumored of being in the process of developing a nuclear bomb. The days after the Trinity test was conducted Truman, Stalin and Churchill were attending the Potsdam conference where the way how to govern Germany was being discussed, now the war in Europe was over. Truman himself believed that deploying these bombs saved half a million american plus japanese lives compared to a continued war on the ground. The question whether he, and others who, to this day, make similar statements were and are right is purely a matter for speculation. No factual conclusions can or should be drawn because their are simply too many scenario's and unknowns, just like nobody currently knows how the Russia vs Ukraine conflict will end.  Fact remains that the bombings caused tremendous loss of life. In view of the fact that Truman called Oppenheimer a \"cry baby\" after Oppie told him that he has blood on his hands, plus the way Truman announced the bombing of Hiroshima with a smile on his face, and that many historians state that the war with Japan was already close to being over before both atomic bombs were dropped, makes one wonder why Truman is still on the fifth place in the list of best USA presidents.  Remarkably, his responsibility for putting over 220.000 people into their graves seems still to be hidden in the shadows of his achievements as regards his continuation and re-inforcement of Roosevelts New Deal, foreign policies and economic reform.  While constructing the bombs, it appears that Oppenheimer was less concerned about its potential military use. Oppenheimer never publicly expressed regret for being the \"Father of the atomic bomb\". However, in view of his conduct and critical statements towards how his bomb had been deployed it is clear that, especially in later years of life, he mentally struggled with remorse. He did openly question whether the use of the bombs on Japan were really necessary. To end this film, I just want to share this thought. Considering that the comments under my video have shown that so many (young) viewers are out of touch with history and are gullible for strange conspiracy and other theories as well as propagate twisted facts, a legitimate question is to what extent films like Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" contribute to even more misinterpreted and misunderstood historic facts.  Although extremely cleverly made and largely based on facts, Nolan has taken the liberty to dramatise and even alter and twist the representation of facts to suite Hollywood's agenda. For example the \"cry baby\" event did not happen as portrayed in the film but took place later in a different setting.  Also Oppenheimer would in reality never have approached Einstein to ask for an opinion about Teller's fear that the bomb might destroy the entire Earth because of an unhaltable continuation of the nuclear fission in the Earths atmosphere. In reality Oppenheimer discussed this with American physicist Karl Taylor Compton. There are at least a dozen more examples of Nolan twisting and replacing fact by fiction in his film.  To what extent future generations will take Nolan's great film for fact is unpredictable, but nevertheless somewhat worrying. It keeps me wondering whether a film can be properly made both with historic correctness and highest entertainment value in mind.",
