      "description": "Blacklisted for his daring \"anti-French\" masterpiece  Le corbeau,  Henri-Georges Clouzot returned to cinema four years later with the 1947 crime-fiction adaptation  Quai des Orfèvres.  Set within the vibrant dance halls and crime corridors of 1940s Paris,  Quai des Orfèvres  follows ambitious performer Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair), her covetous husband Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier), and their devoted confidante Dora Monier (Simone Renant) as they attempt to cover one another's tracks when a sexually orgreish high-society acquaintance is murdered. Enter Inspector Antoine (Louis Jouvet), whose seasoned instincts lead him down a circuitous path in this classic whodunit murder mystery.",
