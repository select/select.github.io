      "description": "The feature film debut of noted cartoonist Picha. This bizarre animated oddity was released during a wave of raunchy animated epics after the wild success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz The Cat. The film is a sendup of old Tarzan films made in the 1930's and concerns Tarzoon [renamed \"Shame\" in the American version to avoid a lawsuit brought forth by the Burroughs' Estate] a man raised by apes in the jungles of Africa, attempting to rescue his sweetheart June from the bald, multi-breasted queen who wants June for her hair. Tarzoon must combat the elements of the jungle as well as the queen's military consisting of anthropomorphic penises [brought to life in the most unhinged manner possible]. The American English dub was rewritten by Saturday Night Live writers Michael O'Donoghue and Anne Beatts, and features SNL alumnus including Bill Murray and John Belushi in the voice cast. This is true psychotronic cinema at its finest, and is well worth your time if you are at all a fan of raunchy animation of yesteryear as well as the bellylaughs once found on Saturday Night Live.",
