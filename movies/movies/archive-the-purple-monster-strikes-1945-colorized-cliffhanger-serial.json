      "description": "A Martian spacecraft crash-lands near the observatory of Dr. Cyrus Layton, designer of Earth's first spaceship. The survivor, forerunner of an invasion, can assume the form of any earthman. Calling himself the \"purple monster,\" the humanoid invader (Roy Barcroft) sets about gaining control of Layton's rocket project. Opposing him is Craig Foster (Dennis Moore), former Secret Service man, and Layton's daughter (Linda Stirling) who episode by episode try to thwart the monster's attempts to acquire rocket components. Will Craig ever suspect that his closest associate is really the monster? 15-chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
