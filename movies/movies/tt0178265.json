    "Plot": "What's to be the new Macy's building, on Manhattan at Broadway and 35th Street, is just a hole being excavated. A stationary camera looks upon a wide scene of at least 60 workers and a couple of horse-drawn wagons. The workmen have picks, shovels, and iron mallets. Steam billows in the background. Two carts emerge from the steam and move down the frame exiting on the viewer's right side. Men lift rocks onto the cart in the foreground.",
