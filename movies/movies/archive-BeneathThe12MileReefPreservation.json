      "description": "Fox recently re-released this film in restored quality, however the original theatrical public domain version wasn't included. most notably the fight scene has been extended to show Mike Petrakis making Arnold eat a cigar, the scene where tony gets beat up is extended to include another line. There's also a few seconds extra in other less notable scenes. using the existing widescreen version here as a guide and the best available sources, the theatrical cut has been recreated. This a s good a copy as your going to find.",
