      "description": "Alex Marsh (John Agar) has created a serum for potential military use, which combines a hypnotic drug and anerve gas. But when he spills the formula on his hands and breathes the vapors, the drug gradually transforms him into a murderous monster. John Agar as Alex Marsh Paula Raymond as Carol Wilson Steve Dunne as Tom Holland Roy Gordon as Dr. Frederick Ramsey John Alonzo as Carlos, lab assistant I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
