    "Plot": "Krazy Kat plays Napoleon engaged in the Russian campaign in this elaborately produced and superior offering in the Mintz cartoon series.Not only are we treated to two original songs, one in an operatic style, but the artwork in this black-and-white cartoon is very elaborate. Indeed, the backgrounding in the scenes, filled with snow is quite beautiful. In all probability this was a reaction to Disney having an exclusive contract with Technicolor for cartoons. While Fleischer might respond with the occasional special in a two-strip process, this was doubtless beyond the budgets that Mintz could afford. Add in the usual decent gags and this one is a superior effort.",
