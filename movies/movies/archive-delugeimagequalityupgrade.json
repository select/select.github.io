      "description": "This print has improved contrast and luminosity. Also it is an undivided MPEG4 (MP4) file for convenient downloading. “Disturbing” “Quite good” “Remarkable” “See it if you can” (IMDB reviews quotes). An end of the world fantasy and romantic drama noted for its remarkable special effects. Good cast headed by Sidney Blackmer and Peggy Shannon. Filmed in part at the Bronson Canyon caves, Griffith Park, Los Angeles. Recommended. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Felix E Feist. Released in 1933. Complete print (Canadian version). PRODUCTION NOTE: The special effects and other production costs proved to be far beyond the financial resources of little KBS Productions, which was forced into bankruptcy",
