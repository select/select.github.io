Best-known for Citizen Kane, this was Orson Welles’ most popular film at the box office\n\nMovie Class by PizzaFLIX: Orson Welles’ CITIZEN KANE (1941) is a cinema masterpiece that flopped at the box office. Shocking yes, but THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS (1942) fared even worse. Behind schedule and over budget, it was a critical success but a financial disaster. Welles needed to prove himself on his third project as director and star. THE STRANGER (1946) is a top-notch thriller and the only film he directed that was a bona fide box office hit!\n\n.",
