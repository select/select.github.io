The Stranger is a post-war suspense film about an escaped Nazi who disguises himself as an ordinary high school teacher in a small town in Connecticut. An officer for the war crimes commission, Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), is tasked with tracking down Franz Kindler (Welles), a mastermind of the concentration camps who, in the aftermath of World War II, has erased all traces of his identity and settled into suburban conformity. It is Welles's third completed feature film as director and his first film noir, about a war crimes investigator tracking a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to a Connecticut town. It is the first Hollywood film to present documentary footage of the Holocaust. ",

Robinson, Loretta Young\nA Federal Agent poses as an antique dealer to snare a Nazi war criminal living in a small Connecticut town with his unsuspecting American fiancee. Best-known for Citizen Kane, this was Orson Welles’ most popular film at the box office\n\nMovie Class by PizzaFLIX: Orson Welles’ CITIZEN KANE (1941) is a cinema masterpiece that flopped at the box office. Shocking yes, but THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS (1942) fared even worse. Behind schedule and over budget, it was a critical success but a financial disaster. Welles needed to prove himself on his third project as director and star. THE STRANGER (1946) is a top-notch thriller and the only film he directed that was a bona fide box office hit!\n\n.",
