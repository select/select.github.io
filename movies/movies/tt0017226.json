      "description": "Naval battle sequence from \"Old Ironsides\" (1926);  starring Charles Farrell, Wallace Beery, Esther Ralston; set in the War with Tripoli circa 1804. The action is overly-hyper and brazenly inauthentic, yet here and there some small but nice historical touches interspersed amid the Hollywood-brand chaos and riot.
