      "description": "\"Spider Baby: or, the Maddest Story Ever Told\" is a 1967 American comedy horror film directed by Jack Hill.  Spider Baby follows the story of the Merrye family, who suffer from a genetic condition known as \"Merrye Syndrome.\" This condition causes them to regress mentally and physically as they age. The family consists of three orphaned siblings—Ralph, Virginia, and Elizabeth—who live in a decaying mansion with their caretaker, Bruno, played by Lon Chaney Jr. The plot thickens when distant relatives arrive to claim the estate, leading to darkly comedic and horrific events as the siblings defend their home.",
