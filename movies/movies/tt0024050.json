In the cantina in town, his girlfriend is doing a dance and Cubby comes in and they do a tango, and then Pedro the Bandito and his gang show up. Pedro wants a 'leetle keese' from Cubby's tango partner, but he saves her and tosses her in a stagecoach to make her getaway but there is no driver and now she is in a runaway, and it's up to Cubby to save the day before the stagecoach goes over the cliff.",
