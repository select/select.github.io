      "description": "A cold war suspense drama costarring Dennis Price and Peggy Ann Garner. This is a TV movie filmed in West Germany by a German production company, and with a mostly German supporting cast. The opening and closing scenes appear to have been shot separately and added later, possibly for its US release. The most interesting aspect of this film is the peculiar nature of its production. Directed by Lawrence Huntington Released in 1954 CAST NOTE: Dennis Price is probably best known for starring in the black comedy, \"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\" in which Alec Guinness plays eight different characters.",
