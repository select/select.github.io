      "description": "Boeiende beelden in kleur van de vooroorlogse crisisjaren in Nederland tussen 1934 en 1936. Deze film is beweging-gestabiliseerd, snelheid-gecorrigeerd en A.I. gerestaureerd en ingekleurd. Highly interesting footage about The Netherlands during the depression period between 1934 and 1936 in color! Among other this film shows men on the dole queing-up for a bicycle registration plate, chained ships waiting in the harbor for better times, deteriorating cascases of smaller and larger ships, men on the dole fishing in the harbor, the police and armed anti-riot forces of the Dutch Weermacht trying to keep control of the streets in the Jordaan quarters in Amsterdam, workmen driving wooden piles into the soft ground in order to build houses on that land, and finally the construction of the Moerdijk bridge whereby the activities of the rivetters is shown in great detail. The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, A.I. enhanced and colorized. Source: Beeld En Geluid.",
