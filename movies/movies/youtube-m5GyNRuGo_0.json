      "description": "This Timeless TV Western starring Lorne Green, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon, is one of the most popular shows in television history!\n\nSILENT THUNDER: Captivated by the pretty, deaf-mute daughter of a reclusive mountain man, Little Joe teaches Ann sign language. Thrilled with her new-found ability to communicate, Annie mistakes her gratitude to Little Joe for love. This sits poorly with Albie, an oafish man obsessed with Ann who wants her for his own.",
