    "Plot": "After the Round-Up (1929)** 1/2 (out of 4)The Rounders, an 11-man band, are the act here as they perform three stars in a gimmick that is meant to have them as cowboys who are gathered around after a hard days work to cut loose and sing some songs. First up is \"West of the Great Divide,\" which sounds pretty good in terms of the music, although the vocals are a bit strange. \"Rose of Monterey\" and \"My Pony Boy\" follow and are pretty catchy, although I'm sure some will find all three songs a tad bit too slow. For the most part I enjoyed this short, which at just 8-minutes is easy to get through and I think The Rounders were at least entertaining. I think less would have been much more throughout the entire picture and this includes having the band members dressed up the way they are. The Western outfits seem a bit much including some that appear to have been extras or at least spoofed in Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES. Fans of Vitaphone shorts are certainly going to want to check this one out. While it's no masterpiece it's at least worth sitting through once.",
