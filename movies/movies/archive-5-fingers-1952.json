      "description": "In neutral Turkey during WWII, the ambitious valet for the British ambassador tires of being the efficient servant and decides to makes lots of money by photographing his employer's secret documents and selling them to the Nazis with the help of a refugee countess. Based on a true story. James Mason as Ulysses Diello Danielle Darrieux as Countess Anna Staviska Michael Rennie as Colin Travers Walter Hampden as Sir Frederic Taylor Oskar Karlweis as L. C. Moyzisch Herbert Berghof as Col. von Richter John Wengraf as Count Franz Von Papen Ben Astar as Siebert (as A. Ben Astar) I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
