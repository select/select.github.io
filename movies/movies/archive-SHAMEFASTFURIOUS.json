      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with poster art or a still photo from one of the movies and drive in style audio. Burning is super easy. Download the zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO TS folder, and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This dvd features another Roger Corman double-bill (and there's going to be a few more) THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS & SHAME plus the preview and intermission reels.",
