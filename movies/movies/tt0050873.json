      "description": "Rocketry expert Quatermass, trying to gain funding for his Moon colonization project, is intrigued by mysterious traces on the radar at his laboratory. He finds that they represent unexpectedly aerodynamic meteors carrying something sealed in ammooia gas. At their landing site he finds a factory suspiciously close to his designs for the Lunar colony, which is supposedly producing synthetic food but is under armed guard. It turns out to be the beachhead of an alien invasion. Directed by Val Guest, based on the TV serial by Nigel Kneale, a sequel to the 1955 film \"The Quatermass Xperiment\". AKA \"Enemy from Space\" Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass John Longden as Inspector Lomax Sidney James as Jimmy Hall Bryan Forbes as Marsh William Franklyn as Brand Vera Day as Sheila Charles Lloyd Pack as Dawson Tom Chatto as Broadhead John Van Eyssen as The P.R.O. Percy Herbert as Gorman Michael Ripper as Ernie I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
