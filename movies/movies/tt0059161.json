      "description": "The Eye Creatures (also known as Attack of the Eye Creatures, or Attack of the the Eye Creatures from a production error) is a 1965 science-fiction film about an invasion of an unnamed American countryside by a flying saucer and its silent, shambling alien occupants. While the military ineptly attempts to stop the invasion, a group of young people, whose reports to the local police are dismissed as pranks or wild imagination, struggle to defend themselves against the menacing monsters. Sound and video quality is fairly poor as this came from a very old video tape.",
