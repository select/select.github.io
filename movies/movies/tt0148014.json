      "description": "A self-promoted and bragging mongrel is trying to prove his status to a doubting-parrot and accidentally swallows the cuckoo from a clock. The parrot tries to extricate the cuckoo from the dog, where the cuckoo seems to be content. The cuckoo and parrot are engaged in combat within the dog, which is not a pretty picture, and following the brawl, the cuckoo is now seen emerging at intervals from the parrot's mouth, which is also not a pretty picture.
