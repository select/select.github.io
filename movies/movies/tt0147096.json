    "Plot": "This retelling of the story of Noah is quite limiting. He is surprised when it starts to rain, yet the ark had already been built. The animals get on board and, fortunately, they can sing and dance. It is funny that the skunks have their own boat tethered to the ark. One question I'm going to ask and perhaps there is a response. In these and many cartoons, several of the animals have what appear to be targets on their bellies (are these navels?). Just wondering.",
