      "description": "When a millionaire's plane crashes near his home laboratory, a scientist removes the man's brain shortly after his death, keeping it alive in a tank and using it for experiments. But the brain is so powerful and ruthless that it telepathically takes control of the scientist's body, using him to vicariously live again and to take revenge on its enemies. Lew Ayres as Dr. Patrick J. Cory Gene Evans as Dr. Frank Schratt Nancy Davis as Janice Cory Steve Brodie as Herbie Yocum Tom Powers as Donovan's Washington Advisor Lisa Howard as Chloe Donovan James Anderson as Chief Tuttle I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
