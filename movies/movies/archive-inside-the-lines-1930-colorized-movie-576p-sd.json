      "description": "Inside the Lines is a 1930 American pre-Code spy drama film starring Betty Compson , Ralph Forbes , and Mischa Auer . It was directed by Roy Pomeroy (who also was the associate producer) from a screenplay by John Farrow and Ewart Adamson , which in turn was based on the 1915 Broadway play of the same name by Earl Derr Biggers . This version is a remake of the 1918 silent version , also with the same name. This film exists in the public domain because the claimants did not renew the copyright after 28 years.",
