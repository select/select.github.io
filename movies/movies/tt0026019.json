Although June is hurled into movie stardom, the intense pressure of Bob's endless publicity stunts and Hollywood party-going makes her long for the simple joys of quiet married life. When she begins to suspect that Bob is more interested in star-building than in love, she quarrels with him and goes out with wealthy admirer Gordon Douglas. Bob, spotting June with Gordon, provokes a fight with his rival. Disgusted by Bob's violent display, June terminates their relationship and makes plans to marry Douglas. As June is about to leave with Douglas, however, Bob stops her airplane with one of his clever publicity stunts. Convinced now that he truly loves her, June flies off with Bob to be married.",
