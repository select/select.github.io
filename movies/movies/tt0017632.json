      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of star Lillian Gish's first big box office flops, Annie Laurie also did not have much impact critically upon release. Modern reviewers, however, find much to praise in the Scottish epic. Particularly commending Gish's performance and the setting. The story follows Annie Laurie as she falls in the middle of a clash between two Scottish clans.",
