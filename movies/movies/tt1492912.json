    "Plot": "In the review by boblipton, he says this short \"Doesn't do much for Canadian-American relations\" and I heartily agree. I have seen dozens (if not hundreds) of Vitaphone musical shorts and must say that it's among the lamest of the lot. The emcee (Jack White) talks too fast and is annoying....like a six year-old who thinks they are talented and INSIST on entertaining all the adults who come into contact with them. Additionally, the musical numbers by him and the rest are pretty limp. I might have cut this one some slack had it debuted a few years earlier but by 1929 Vitaphone was making many better musical shorts...and nearly all were less annoying than this.",
