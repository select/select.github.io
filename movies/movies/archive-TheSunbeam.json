      "description": "The Sunbeam was directed by D W Griffith in 1912. When a film called The Sunbeam refers to a little girl with a dead mother, you know you are in for a bit of sentimentality and so you are. But given that, it is a neat little film with an interesting picture of life in a tenement house and the social mores of the day.",
