      "description": "Seven-year-old Sasha's violin case was taken away by older kids. Things would have gone badly for the young musician if a worker, the skating rink driver Sergei, hadn't stood up for him. The boy became friends with Sergei, who even trusted him to skate on the skating rink on his own and took him with him to lunch. On the way, Sasha gets a lesson in camaraderie - Sergei teaches him to stand up for a little one if an older one offends him. But Sasha also reveals a new truth to Sergei - playing the violin is not a pastime, but serious work. And although in the evening, Sasha's mother does not let Sergei and Sasha go to \"Chapaev\", this cannot destroy the mutual respect that has emerged between the little violinist and the skating rink driver.\n\nIMDb: 7.4\n\nYear of the production: 1960\n\nDirectors: Tarkovsky Andrei\nScriptwriters: Tarkovsky Andrei, Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky Andrei\nComposer: Ovchinnikov Vyacheslav\nCameraman: Yusov Vadim\nProduction designer: Agoyan Sovet\n\nCast: Natalia Arkhangelskaya, Vladimir Zamansky, Igor Fomchenko",
