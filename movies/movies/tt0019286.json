      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Soviet propaganda film is notable not only for brisk and exciting camerawork, but also for having an Asian lead and starring many Asian actors in a time when this was exceedingly rare in Western film. The fictional storyline follows a descendant of Ghengis Khan who repeatedly comes into negative contact with the occupying British army. Eventually, when his heritage is discovered, the occupiers intend to use him to set up a puppet regime under their control, with surprising results. ",

In 1920 he helps the partisans fight for the Soviets against the occupying army. However he is captured when the army tries to requisition cattle from the herdsmen at the same time as the commandant meets with the reincarnated Grand Lama. After being shot, the army discovers an amulet that suggests he was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. They find him still alive, so the army restores his health and plans to use him as the head of a Mongolian puppet regime.",
