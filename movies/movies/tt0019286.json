      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Soviet propaganda film is notable not only for brisk and exciting camerawork, but also for having an Asian lead and starring many Asian actors in a time when this was exceedingly rare in Western film. The fictional storyline follows a descendant of Ghengis Khan who repeatedly comes into negative contact with the occupying British army. Eventually, when his heritage is discovered, the occupiers intend to use him to set up a puppet regime under their control, with surprising results. ",
