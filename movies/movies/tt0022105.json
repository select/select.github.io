      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The oldest surviving feature-length Japanese sound film, \"The Neighbor's Wife and Mine\" finds a writer constantly distracted by his new, jazz-loving neighbors. The picture won the award for best film of the year in the film magazine Kinema Junpo, and modern viewers generally find it an entertaining, if slight, movie.  Unfortunately, all the best quality versions of this film that I could find have burnt-in English subtitles. If I find another high quality copy that does not have those, I will upload it right away.",
