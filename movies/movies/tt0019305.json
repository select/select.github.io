      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Dolores Del Rio stars in this synchronized sound romance drama based on the 1884 novel. Its story follows a mixed Native-American/Mexican woman who falls in love with a Native man, with both of them facing racism and discrimination. Critics enjoyed the scenery, characters and acting, and box office was quite good for the time. Ramona was thought to be lost for decades before a print was rediscovered in 2010. ",
