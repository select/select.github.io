Luckily, there is still one room available, however, it is completely unfurnished, let alone, decorated. Normally, this would be a serious problem, not for our extraordinary resident though, whose peculiar handbag contains everything but the kitchen sink. As if by magic, the mysterious lodger will put the finishing touches on his new cosy space, nevertheless, is the landlord's wife happy with the fiendish tenant?",
