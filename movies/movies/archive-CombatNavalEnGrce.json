      "description": "Star Film Catalogue no. 110 Combat Naval en Grèce (Naval Combat in Greece) Director: Georges Méliès Production Co: Star-Film Country: France Release Date: 1897 Length: 1' 6\" This is a very quaint film from Georges Méliès. Seen today, you'll probably laugh at how antiquated it looks. However, keep in mind that this film is still way ahead of the norm for the era, as back in the late 1890s, most films were amazingly mundane--such as showing trains arriving at stations and people playing cards. The film is a recreation of a scene from a naval battle off the Greek coast. The boats and backgrounds are clearly painted but what struck me was how the boat rocked. Heck, if it was in a hurricane it never would have rocked THIS fast! Obviously folks were off camera rocking the set up and down -but they did it so quickly you can't help but laugh. But, with a decent set, nice explosions and a decent style, it's still an intriguing look into the early work of this brilliant director. - 21 July 2011 | by planktonrules (Bradenton, Florida)",
