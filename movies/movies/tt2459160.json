      "description": "The Road to the Open - is an offbeat comedy and a classic underdog story about a has-been tennis team, single parenthood, the quest for love, and a once in a lifetime shot at greatness. Struggling after the loss of his wife, Jerry McDonald is a balding hospital janitor and single father whose only semi-social outlet is tennis with his best friend, Miles, who is still chasing dreams of stardom and working through anger management  Reluctantly, Jerry agrees to play with Miles in a local tournament that could earn them a match in a prestigious competition. For Jerry, though, the thought of winning and defeating the long-time club champion Gallant brothers is as unlikely as finding true love again, until a new co-worker enters his life and gives him a renewed hope.\n2014.

Jerry McDonald has become a recluse after losing his wife to breast cancer, and raising his 10 year old daughter is his sole purpose in life, aside from the semi social outlet of tennis with his childhood friend, Miles, an eccentric trust funder who lives on a tennis court in an Airstream trailer. Feeling like his chance at love has been lost, Jerry has seemingly given up, until his daughter asks, 'Do you think you'll ever get married again?' Jerry takes a chance at love with Sam from work, and what emerges is a Road to the Open.",
