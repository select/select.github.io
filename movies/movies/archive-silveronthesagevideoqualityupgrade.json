      "description": "This print is less than perfect, but it has improved contrast and brightness. “Well done and interesting” “Entertaining” “More fun and adventure with Hoppy and company” (IMDB reviews quotes). Hoppy goes undercover to catch twin crooks and their gang of cattle rustlers, which gves more screen time to Gabby and Russell. Good cast and good production values. All of which place it a lariat above the average matinee oater. Followed in 1941 by “In Old Colorado.” IMDB rating 7.0. Directed by Lesley Selander. Released in 1939. Complete print (original release) TRIVIA: The 23 rd  of 66 Hopalong Cassidy westerns.",
