    "Plot": "So many early cartoons depend on a sort of surrealism. In this one, Krazy seems to be living at and running an antique shop. In it are representations of all sorts of historical periods. Exhausted, he goes to bed at midnight. At that point, all kinds of figures come to life, sort of like \"Night at the Museum.\" Skeletons are dancing with empty armor. Two figures from the French dance a minuet. And so on. There is an old man who starts the whole thing, turning his long beard into a turban. All the figures gather around a table and sing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" Why? Who knows. There is lots of dancing once again in these old films. I guess it is to show as much movement as possible.",
