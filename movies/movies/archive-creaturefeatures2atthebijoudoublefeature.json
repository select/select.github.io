      "description": "Ah those amazing days of yore with monster bugs the makers of Raid could only dream about and city-stomping Godzilla ripoffs wreaking havoc everywhere. Both are part of tonight’s Bijou spectacular. The evening of creature catastrophes  begins with radiation-spawned monsters previews. Then in “The Giant Behemoth” a huge radioactive dinosaur spoils boating trips on the Thames. Next Peggie Castle and Peter Graves watch grasshoppers slide off glossy photos of Chicago buildings in “Beginning of the End.” (Huh! And you thought creature features were silly.)",
