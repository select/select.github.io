    "Plot": "Krazy Kat and Kitty go golfing, pursued by people who want to play through and a narrator who comments on every danged thing.My parents were golfers, and so I was exposed to it, but after getting through my first nine holes in 157 shots, I settled on that as personal best, and took up permanent residence at the 19th hole. As a result, I appreciate the rather ill-spirited attitudes and uncomprehending jibes at a sport that has been referred to as 'a good walk spoiled'.As with the others in the long-running series directed by Manny Gould and Benjamin Harrison (who was not president of the United States), it's a well produced cartoon that has nothing but the name in common with the George Herriman comic strip.",
