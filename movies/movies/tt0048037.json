      "description": "English Subtitles Remastered 720p The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz (Spanish: Ensayo de un crimen); literally: Rehearsal for a Crime is a 1955 Mexican crime comedy film directed and co-written by Spanish-born filmmaker Luis Buñuel. It tells the story of a would-be serial killer whose female victims keep dying before he has the chance to murder them. Academic Analysis: Ensayo de un crimen has been analyzed and studied by academics and critics such as Victor Fuentes, Gerardo T. Cummings, Marsha Kinder, and Ilan Stavans. Fuentes, a retired professor from the University of California, Santa Barbara, included chapters dedicated to the detailed analytical study of the film in his book, La mirada de Buñuel (Spain: Tabla Rasa Libros y Ediciones, 2006), finding correlations between Ensayo de un crimen and Él. In 2004, Cummings published an article in the Puerto Rican journal Revista Horizontes, in which he analyzed the intersexual connections between the film and its literary source, the novel of the same name by Rodolfo Usigli (this article was part of a larger dissertation chapter on the echoes of the novel in the film)   The film's exploration of obsessive desire has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). In 2002, Slant Magazine called the film \"a twisted tragicomedy on male obsession, the closest Spanish auteur Luis Buñuel ever came to directing a bona fide suspense thriller.   Wikipedia     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criminal_Life_of_Archibaldo_de_la_Cruz",
