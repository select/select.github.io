      "description": "They Live by Night is a 1948 American film noir directed by Nicholas Ray in his directorial debut and starring Cathy O'Donnell and Farley Granger . Based on Edward Anderson's Depression-era novel Thieves Like Us , the film follows a young fugitive who falls in love with a woman and attempts to begin a life with her. The film opened theatrically in London in August 1948 under the title The Twisted Road and was released in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures as They Live by Night in November 1949. Although the film received favorable reviews from film critics, it was a box-office failure , losing the studio $ 445,000 (equivalent to $5.88 million in 2024). Although the film is widely considered as the prototype for the \"couple on the run\" genre and the forerunner to Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the story was first depicted in Fritz Lang 's 1937 film You Only Live Once , starring Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney . Director Jim Jarmusch cites the film as one of the influences on no wave cinema and his work in general. Robert Altman directed another adaptation of the novel in 1974 using the original title of the novel, Thieves Like Us .",
