      "description": "Sugihara is a troubled youth with a Zainichi Korean father and Japanese mother. His father Hideyoshi was once a professional boxer in North Korea and he has trained Sugihara to fight ever since he was a child. After completing junior high school at a brutally strict institution emphasizing the Marxist ideology favored by the North Korean regime, Sugihara is determined to switch to a regular Japanese high school. At his new school, he has to deal with boys who challenges him to fights daily, but his life changes when Sugihara falls for Sakurai, a mysterious girl he meets at a party. Sugihara is lacking in social skills but his affection for her appears to be reciprocated. But he fears that telling her about his ethnic background might jeopardize their budding relationship. Then Sugihara gets a call from an old friend from his days at the North Korean school. What Jong Il has to tell him will have grave consequences for his relationship with Sakurai",
