      "description": "An unhappily married man (Alan Curtis) spends the evening with a woman he picked up in a bar. Returning home, he finds his wife strangled and becomes the prime suspect in her murder. Every effort to establish his alibi fails, as no one seems to remember seeing this \"phantom\" lady, or her distinctive hat. In prison, he gives up hope, but his devoted secretary (Ella Raines) doggedly pursues ephemeral clues through shadowy nocturnal streets, putting her own life in danger from the real killer. Based on the novel by Cornell Woolrich Ella Raines as Carol Richman Franchot Tone as Jack Marlow Alan Curtis as Scott Henderson Aurora Miranda as Estela Monteiro Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess Fay Helm as Ann Terry Elisha Cook Jr. as Cliff Andrew Tombes as Bartender Regis Toomey as Detective I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday. For questions or general comments, please use the Colorized Movies Forum at https://archive.org/details/colorized-movies?tab=forum",
