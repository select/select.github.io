    "Plot": "There is no plot to this cartoon. Krazy Kat works at a wax museum. It is filled with everyday images in wax. It also has several celebrities of the time. Joe E. Brown and Jimmy Durante are the most famous. Unfortunately, after Krazy has done all his dusting and cleaning, a fire breaks out. As it make its way through the museum, it destroys and changes. Many of the changes involve making things smaller or thinner, or in one or two cases, showing a skeleton beneath the wax. Krazy does what he can to stop the fire, but it seems to feed on itself. Let's face it. This is one really badly run place that ends tragically. Krazy Kat, like many of the comedy figures of the time, is utterly incompetent.",
