      "description": "ADULT CONTENT ADVISORY: This grindhouse double feature simulation contains nudity and other content some viewers might find objectionable. The 2am Theater raises its ugly head to present an insomniac double feature dedicated to those who remember Manhattan's row of grindhouse palaces on 42nd Street between Times Square and 8th Avenue. (The whole damn block is now owned by Disney.) Our trip down the sleazy side of memory lane begins with coming attractions and a Betty Page bondage short, followed by the first feature, \"The Wild and Wicked.\" The intermission featurette is the vintage nudie \"The Forbidden Daughters\" followed by the second feature presentation, \"The Defilers.\" After which showering with disinfectant soap is recommended.",
