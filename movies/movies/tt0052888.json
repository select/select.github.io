Whenever exposed to sunlight, McKenna devolves into a lizard man with homicidal tendencies. After having a brief fling with a nightclub singer, and killing her boyfriend, McKenna is on the lam from the police which culminates in a one on one battle on top of a tower. Great monster costume and Shatner type acting from Clarke are the most memorable parts of this great 1950s creature feature.",
