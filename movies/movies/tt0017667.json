Directed by: Alan Crosland Actors: John Barrymore, Conrad Veidt, Marceline Day Production Company: Feature Productions Release Date: 12 March 1927 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1 In 1432, while François Villon is still an infant, his father dies as a martyr to his devotion to France. François grows up to be a renowned poet, an ardent patriot, and a notorious carouser who is not above criminal acts. During the revels of All Fools Day, he insults Duke Charles of Burgundy, for which King Louis XI, who is afraid of Charles, banishes Villon from Paris. In exile outside the city walls, François looks for ways to protect France from Burgundy's plots. When Charles plans to have one of his associates marry the king's ward Charlotte, Villon successfully disrupts the engagement, but for so doing is sentenced to death. But Villon finds a way to exploit Louis's superstitious nature long enough to give him another chance to serve France, while at the same time seeking the hand of Charlotte.",

      "description": "The Beloved Rogue showcases one of Barrymore's better performances. The great German actor Conrad Veidt (Casablanca) co-stars as the king. Also of note is the magnificent, whimsical set designed by William Cameron Menzies. A swashbuckling John Barrymore, as 15th century poet Francois Villon, takes on King Louis XI to save his paramour.",
