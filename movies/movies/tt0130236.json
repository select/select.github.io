    "Plot": "As the brutal Japanese gang known as the Katana gradually spreads its tentacles throughout sunny Los Angeles, controlling everything from drugs and gambling to prostitution, no one is safe to walk the streets. To deal with the problem, the Los Angeles Police Department enlists the help of an expert: Detective Joe Marshall, an avid Japanophile trained in the way of the sword and the ancient Bushido code of conduct. As a result, protected by the unbreakable code of silence of the feared Yakuza, Katana boss Fuji Fujiyama and his lethal right-hand man Yamashita wage war on anyone who stands in their way. Joe and his new partner, Officer Frank Washington have no other choice but to bring out the big guns. Can Samurai Cop put an end to Fujiyama's reign of terror?",
