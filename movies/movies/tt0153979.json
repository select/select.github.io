    "Plot": "One of the standard cartoon plots of the 1930s was that people left their shops or a particular location, and things came to life. It might happen in a drug store or a book shop and often resulted in a series of puns or gags based on product names. It seems to have ended with Bob Clampett's BOOK REVUE (1946) .... but was revived very clearly with Pixar's TOY STORY. So it's been lurking around all along.In this example of the genre we get a toy shop variation. The interest, such as it is, lies in the sole fact that the toys come alive. there is a soprano chorus going on about how much fun it is, and that spider who had been plaguing small things in Terrytoons for a decade also threatens the inhabitants of the store.It's a fairly typical, slightly gooey Terrytoon, aimed at small, dull kiddies. Like far too many of them, you can skip this one.",
