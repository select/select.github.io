    "Plot": "Why do we love comedies starring scrupulous liars out to gain a lover (or a fortune) by taking advantage of others? Presumably because deep down we all would like to be that inventively naughty and still come out on top. Or maybe it's just that everybody wants to be loved (or rich). Chambermaid Hanni works for Dr. Fuergartner and his wife Lissy, and is taking full advantage of residing in their big fancy house (twice a week she has her piano lesions there). She also knows the Fuergartners are friends with Herbert Gaspari, a famous flyboy she fancies, and has been corresponding with him under the assumed name of Isabella. Unbeknown to her, Lissy Fuergartner is planning to marry off the pilot to her sister.When 'Isabella' (wearing one of Lissy's dresses) finally meets her Herbert at a bar, Herr Doktor accidentally arrives on the scene and blows her cover. The pilot does not seem to mind, but Frau Fuergartner, mistakingly believing her husband and the maid are having an affair, has Hanni fired immediately. Still, her husband needs the girl to stay close to Mr. King, a man he has to impress at any cost (most comedies have a character like this, too). Dirty old King is about to divorce his forth wife and fancies Hanni as the next one. So everyone reunites at a big dinner party (one of the few signs that this was based on a play). Hanni, now engaged to King (which does not seem to matter to the pilot either), is now trying to hook the old man up with her not so refined best friend. Since both of them are dressed up in Mrs Fuergartner's fine clothes, the Mrs. winds up playing the maid.6 out of 10",
