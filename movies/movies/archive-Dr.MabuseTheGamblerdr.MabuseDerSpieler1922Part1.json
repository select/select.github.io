      "description": "A film about the dastardly doings of Norbert Jacques's title villian, directed by Fritz Lang. Rudolf Klein-Rogge stars in a role he later repeated in \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\" (aka \"The Crimes of Dr. Mabuse) in 1933. This is actually the first part of a film that was released in two parts, something Lang has done a few times (The Indian Tomb, Siegfried). Unfortunately, I do not have part 2. I hope at some point someone who has a copy of Part 2 to be kind enough to upload it. Until then, I thought it fitting to upload what I have. NOTE: This is a vhs rip of a print that seems a little faded.",
