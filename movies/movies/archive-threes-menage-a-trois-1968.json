      "description": "Yet another film set during the sexual revolution where people try to find happiness through multiple partners. Oddly the only threesome in the movie is when the female lead watches a movie with three women in it.  The movie is shot in close up but not graphic detail. Nick Millard was probably working with a 16mm camera in small rooms.",
