      "description": "Orumcek (Turkish Spiderman) is a Turkish superhero film from 1972, Orumcek means \"spider\" in Turkish, and despite the film's unofficial English title, there seems to be almost no connection to the western superhero. Instead, you can expect lots of fights, babes, Turkish music and dancing, motorcycle riding and a folically challenged, lushly mustachioed villain. It was directed by Selahattin Hicdurmaz and stars Cuneyt Arkin, Meral Orhonsay and Suleyman Turan. This film is recommended for lovers of old Turkish movies and fans of psychotronic cult cinema. It's in unsubtitled Turkish, but that doesn't matter, really. If you're even a little curious, give it a watch.",
