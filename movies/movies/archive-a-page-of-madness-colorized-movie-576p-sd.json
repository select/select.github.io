      "description": "A Page of Madness ( 狂った一頁 , Kurutta Ichipeiji ) is a 1926 Japanese silent experimental horror film directed by Teinosuke Kinugasa . Lost for 45 years until it was rediscovered by Kinugasa in his storehouse in 1971, the film is the product of an avant-garde group of artists in Japan known as the Shinkankakuha (or School of New Perceptions) who tried to overcome naturalistic representation . The film is set in a mental institution in contemporary Japan. Yasunari Kawabata , who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, was credited on the film with the original story. He is often cited as the screenwriter, and a version of the scenario is printed in his complete works, but the scenario is now considered a collaboration between him, Kinugasa, Banko Sawada, and Minoru Inuzuka . Eiji Tsuburaya is credited as an assistant cameraman.",
