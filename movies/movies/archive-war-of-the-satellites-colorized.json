      "description": "Aliens have been observing us and destroying every manned satellite we try to put in orbit. When the United Nations ignores their warning to cease trying to go into space, they send an agent to sabotage the project by impersonating someone working on it. Dick Miller as Dave Boyer Susan Cabot as Sybil Carrington Richard Devon as Dr. Pol Van Ponder Eric Sinclair as Dr. Howard Lazar Michael Fox as Jason ibn Akad Robert Shayne as Cole Hotchkiss Directed by: Roger Corman I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
