      "description": "This is a five minute short film from Georges Méliès. Like most of his films, Méliès himself appears in the movie--as the jester. He bounces about and tries to entertain the king. However, Francois appears bored by all this. But, when the jester brings out a pretty lady (in 1907 clothing, by the way), the king takes notice! Then, the jester goes about doing the usual Méliès stuff--magic (as he was a stage magician before turning to films).Sadly, the final portion of the film is degraded and this is the best copy I've been able to procure for my collection. Director: Georges Méliès Stars: Georges Méliès Release Date: USA 25 January 1908 Also Known As (AKA) François Ier et Triboulet France (original title) The King and the Jester USA",
