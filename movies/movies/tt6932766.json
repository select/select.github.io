      "description": "When a Native Hawaiian hula dancer escaping her abusive boyfriend crashes her van into a mysterious homeless man, she finds herself flung into a surrealistic journey of self-exploration and reconnection to nature within the shadows of commercial Waikiki. This intimate narrative breaks down the enduring, stereotypical image of paradise to reveal a vulnerable and authentic portrait of indigeneity.\n\n2024.
