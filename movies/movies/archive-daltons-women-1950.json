      "description": "Marshal Lash LaRue and his partner Fuzzy Jones (Al St. John) are after the infamous Dalton gang, which has moved west and taken new identities. They receive help from Pinkerton agent Joan Talbot (Pamela Blake) as they try to sort out who the bad guys really are. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
