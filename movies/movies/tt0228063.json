      "description": "Two hippie friends become managers of a bikini factory owned by one of their fathers.  Sadly, I cannot find subtitles for this one. Fully half of the movie is taken up showing a party with a couple bands doing covers of at-the-time current American hits. There are a couple different Les Pauls on display as well as an SG (could be a copy) and what might be an Eco bass EBO copy.  Really feels like the movie was mashed together from two different films or the main story was so short a massive amount of filler was added.",
