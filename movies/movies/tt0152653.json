    "Plot": "I discovered the Scrappy cartoons recently and LOVED the first one I saw (\"The Little Pest\") because it was completely inappropriate and cruel. Scrappy spends much of the cartoon beating the crap out of little Oopie--and even drowns the little pest!! Unfortunately, the other Scrappy cartoons I saw were much more family-friendly and appropriate! I say this because most cartoons of the 1930s were not edgy in the least and consisted of lots of happy singing animals (yeck!) and it was nice to see something different.Here in \"Sunday Clothes\", we find a nicer version of Scrappy. No child abuse here. But, unfortunately, the cartoon does feature some annoying singing--a major bane of 30s animation. Fortunately, aside from the cutesy singing, the rest of the cartoon is pretty clever. Scrappy has been told by his mother to keep his Sunday Church clothes clean--and everything seems to be conspiring to soil them--from a guy spitting tobacco out the window to a group of bullies trying to push him into the mud. All in all, a bit too cute but also worth your time.",
