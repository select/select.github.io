      "description": "Schoolgirl Lindsey hopes to be an Olympic diver and has a strict training regime, but this goes out the window when supportive father Stewart leaves home and her mother Jacqueline moves in her new boyfriend. Lindsey has sex with 16-year-old Robert and becomes pregnant. She is afraid that Robert will not be supportive, but he goes to the scan with her, admitting he is scared. Will, Robert's single-parent dad, is angry when told the news, but Robert's brother Alex, an embittered soldier home for good from Afghanistan, is supportive, offering to fund a termination and then a flat. After quarreling and parting, Lindsey and Robert reunite for the baby's birth and Lindsey, much to Robert's approval, resumes her diving, watched by her partner and baby.\n2010.
