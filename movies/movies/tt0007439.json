Thais invites Count San Remo to seduce him too. The house is decorated in a futuristic style, with hypnotizing geometric patterns, repetitive elements on the walls like the eyes of a peacock's tail. Bianca falls from the horse, because disappointed by the Count who loved inside her, she launches into a wild ride on horseback. Thais feels guilty for this. Thais wants to die in the poisonous gases in his room, but his survival instinct lights up even though Thais dies in despair and madness.",
