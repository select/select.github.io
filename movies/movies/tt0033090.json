      "description": "“Nothing new, but perfectly done” (IMDB review quote). Spies, counterspies and an illicit love affair in a fast-paced espionage thriller that foreshadowed the outbreak of World War 2. In fact by the time of its release Germany had already invaded Poland. Good cast and adequate production, but unfortunately this print has only marginal video quality. IMDB rating 6.8. Directed by David MacDonald. UK release 1939. US release 1940 (edited version). Complete print (original UK version). A. K.A. “Spies in the Air” & “The Fifth Column”",
