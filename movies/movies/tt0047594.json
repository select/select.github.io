      "description": "This film has Lamont Cranston, aka The Shadow, and was the only one that showed him with the power to cloud men's minds, to make himself unseen. It has the look of a TV show, and is reported to have been conceived as a series pilot. The makers decided to release it as a movie, to be shown in theaters, instead. None of the characters from the radio show, other than Lamont Cranston, appear in this story. It's most fun when he uses his mind clouding ability to vanish.",

He carries with him a suicide note dedicated to his only friend, who is also an invisible man. An eager young reporter tracks down Takemitsu Nanjo, a war veteran who makes his living visibly, painting his face like a clown's and carrying advertising signs. His favorite neighbor is a little blind girl whose mother is running afoul of local gangsters. The gangsters have been terrorizing the city as \"the invisible gang,\" wrapping themselves up in scarves and trenchcoats so as to be visible to their victims, even though they are supposed to be invisible underneath. Once they discover Nanjo, who is defending his only friends, they beat him and leave him for dead.",
