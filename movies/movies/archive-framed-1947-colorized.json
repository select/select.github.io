      "description": "A mining engineer looking for work runs afoul of a femme fatale who plans to use him to take the blame in her money-making scheme. Glenn Ford as Mike Lambert Janis Carter as Paula Craig Barry Sullivan as Steve Price Edgar Buchanan as Jeff Cunningham Karen Morley as Beth Jim Bannon as Jack Woodworth I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
