    "Plot": "Curious to know that during the WW2 Nazi-German cinema not only produced the standard productions (propaganda, entertainment etc.), but still also children's films, like this adaptation of the fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. Film-technically poor to say the least (at some moments extremely bad), the film has an innocence that gives it its greatest value and charm. How it could have passed censorship, is not clear to me as it richly indulges in ridiculing authorities, including the Kriegsrat (Counsellor of War); in general Nazi-censorship had little sense of humour. The sets are only so-so, but one can see that the makers did their best.I hardly can ascertain whether this b&amp;w and slow film still strikes a chord with children up to 6 years. The main interest of this film may be for those interested in all aspects of  German cinema.",
