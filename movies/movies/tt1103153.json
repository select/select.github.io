      "description": "The deal is simple. Buy the stolen drugs for almost nothing, sell them and make a bundle. For Ray and the others, it's the deal of their lives. For Heather, the rich girl, it's a ride on the wild side. Deep in the dark, abandoned warehouse, Speed, the dealer, counts the money. Outside, a black Mercedes pulls up...five killers step out. They want their drugs back and they don't want witnesses. Trapped in the warehouse, the horror begins.\n1997.  Stars: Kim Little, Paul Logan, Scott Carson\n*Licensed from The Asylum.

    "Plot": "Spencer Aimes is just your average, undercover, government-hired super-assassin accustomed to a life of exotic European locales, flashy sports cars and even flashier women. But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.",
