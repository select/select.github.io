After his youthful ambition leads to a tragic marriage, his acts of revenge thrust him into direct conflict with the Philistine Army. As his brother mounts a tribal rebellion, only Samson's (Taylor James') relationship with a Philistine seductress and his final surrender - to the Philistines and to God - turns imprisonment and blindness into final victory.",
