    "Plot": "A new schoolteacher arrives at Snakeville and immediately all the marriageable men of the county come a-courtin'. The affair finally resolves about Jack Heyworth and Broncho Billy, but it is evident that the teacher is partial to Billy. Jack plots to get even and opportunity soon offers. The boys warn the schoolmistress not to go out at night but she tells them she is not afraid and shows them a small revolver which she carries with her. Just for fun the boys plan a hold-up to try the schoolma'am's nerve and Broncho Billy agrees to play the bandit. This is Jack's opportunity and when the hold-up occurs, he, stationed behind a bush, a few feet away, fires at Billy. The wounded man is carried to his shack and the schoolteacher is about to be arrested when she shows the sheriff that her gun had contained nothing but blanks and points out Heyworth as the man who shot Billy. Heyworth is ordered to clear out of the country and when Billy gets well school is closed a week earlier because of teacher's marriage to the hero of Snakeville.",
