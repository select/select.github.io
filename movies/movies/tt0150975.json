    "Plot": "It's a lovely spring day. Krazy Kat dances over to Kitty's house with his squeaky puppy, where she is spring cleaning. Of course she recruits Krazy, and of course he cleans using slapstick gags. The work is just about done when the puppy gets loose.There's a lovely balletic sequence where Krazy and Kitty clean the floor using brushes strapped to their feet like skates. I've seen this gag used in Mary Pickford's THROUGH THE BACK DOOR.",
