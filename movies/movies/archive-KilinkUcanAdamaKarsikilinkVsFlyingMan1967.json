      "description": "Kilink Ucan Adama Karsi (Kilink vs Flying Man) is a Turkish superhero movie from 1967. It was directed by Yilmaz Atadeniz and stars Yildram Gencer, Irfan Atasoy, Pervin Par and Suzan Avci. Kilink is an over-the-top baddie in a skeleton suit. The ending of this move was lost, and was replaced by still photos and Turkish narration. Don't let that scare you off, though- this is a lot of fun.",
