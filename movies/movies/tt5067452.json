      "description": "1931 directed by Otto Brower and David Burton starring Gary Cooper, Lili Damita, Tully Marshall, Ernest Torrance, Eve Southern and Fred Kohler. Gary Cooper is a young scout who leads a wagon train across country, battling evil Indians and seedy traders, while his two unwashed companions (both confirmed bachelors) try and save him from falling in love (ew!) with a girl (yuck!). This copy has been sharpened a bit.",
