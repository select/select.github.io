At his trial, he presents irrefutable evidence that he could not have committed the crime - which, of course, he didn't - and is acquitted, thereby assuring that he can't be tried again for the murder. A police detective, however, is convinced that the man was responsible for the wife's murder, and sets out to prove it.",
