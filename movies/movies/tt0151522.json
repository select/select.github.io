    "Plot": "Krazy Kat is a snake oil salesman. He puts on a show, charming a snake, cutting a person in half, and so on. Of course, after demonstration getting an arthritic old guy to turn into a child, the whole town is ready for his stuff. They can't get enough of it. The rest of the cartoon involves a mouse who drinks a whole bottle and turns into a lion. He is soon terrorizing everyone. It is the usual chase stuff with the cleverness coming from an encounter with a fruit peddler and his fruit. Krazy and his horse seem to be the stars here, but there are risked and he takes them. There is some very good animation. During the depression, people wanted something that was easy, and guys like this promised it.",
