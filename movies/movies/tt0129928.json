      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This airplane mystery was inspired by the story of Bessie Coleman, the first Native American/African-American woman to receive a pilots license. It follows a pilot who returns a hero from World War I, but finds a criminal mystery in his home town. No contemporary reviews appear to have survived, though modern audiences find the film to be more than it appears on the surface. ",
