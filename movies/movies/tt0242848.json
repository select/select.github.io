    "Plot": "Widower Bill Morgan took in his loser brother-in-law, Uncle Johnny to his cynical, materially spoiled brats Kyle and Charlene, who never need long to chase each new au-pair screaming, while Bill spends all his time on business and a budding affair with a close, equally workaholic spinster colleague. The kids' misbehavior and disbeliever comments on a 'Santa Smells' website got them struck from the Northpole Christmas gifts list, like so many that Santa refuses to go on and leaves on his and Mrs. Klaus's first Hawaian holiday. Firstborn daughter Rudolfa was waiting to succeed and turn Christmas into a creepy prank festival, but her gentle younger sister Kristen begs a change to save Christmas be redeeming the Morgan family. So she reports as new au-pair, who wins the rascals over, finally helped by Johnny, who fears eviction. However Rudolfa has an evil plan, exploiting Bill refusal to pit up a Christmas tree and a crucial business presentation.",
