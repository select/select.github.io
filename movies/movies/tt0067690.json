      "description": "Kind of a Elizabeth Bathory movie set in an empty hotel. The desk clerk remembers our vampiress from when he was a little boy and is properly frightened of her.  Less neck biting and more mind control than some movies of this sort, our vampire is more of the soul sucking type. Similar story line that Hunger will follow in 1983.",

    "Plot": "A chic, good-looking and suitably 70's couple arrive at an extravagant and deserted seaside hotel after eloping. Stefan is wealthy and happily English, with a hidden streak of sadism, while Valarie is intelligent but of inferior (Swedish) blood. To keep her with him at the eerie hotel he lies consistantly about his relationship with his mother and his plans to tell her of their marriage. Meanwhile he has mysterious phone conversations with an older, dominant and pampered sissy. Two fresh guests arrive; the Hungarian countess, Elizabeth Bathory and her voluptuous protege, Ilona. Virgin corpses begin showing up about the city drained of their blood. A wary detective lurks around the hotel taunting his only suspect, the Countess.",
