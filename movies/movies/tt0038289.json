      "description": "“Highly entertaining” “Forgotten masterpiece” “Superior” “Casts a spell” “Strange and delightful” “Deborah Kerr = outstanding” (IMDB reviews quotes). A naive Irish lass (Kerr) who was raised on blood-curdling tales of the Republican Army hates all things English and Cromwell in particular. This leads to her getting caught up in a Nazi plot in this fast-paced and suspenseful spy thriller that doesn’t entirely neglect comedy. Trevor Howard costars at the head of a superb cast of Irish and English character actors. An outstanding production partially filmed in County Wexford and Dublin, Ireland and on the Isle of Man. Highly recommended. IMDB rating 7.1. Directed by Frank Launder. Released in 1946. Complete print. AKA “The Adventuress”",
