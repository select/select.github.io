    "Plot": "Mr. Cody arrives by carriage, walks to a barn, and slides open the doors to reveal a large biplane. He pulls it out of the hanger. One man checks the engine while another starts the propeller. Four men push the plane into position for taxi and take-off. Cody takes his seat and puts on heavy leather gloves. Then, the long take-off begins as Cody steers the plane through a relatively flat, grassy field. It lifts for a brief flight and then falls to earth. One man walks Cody back toward the barn while the plane's builders inspect the extensive damage.",
