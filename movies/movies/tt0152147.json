      "description": "While George Herriman is credited as Kat's creator here, Krazy in this short bears little resemblance to the original comic strip character. In fact, instead of pining for Ignaz Mouse, this Kat is hunting American Indians, what we call Native Americans today, as he gets almost burned at the stake by them (it should be noted that the fire, like in many animated shorts made during this time, has a personality of his own here!).

    "Plot": "Krazy and a motley band of horses and turkeys set out across the plains on a covered wagon trek west. They are attacked by indians along the way and he is tied to a stake and a fire set at his feet. He blows cold air on the flames, making them vanish, then manages to run away, but the indians chase him. He manages to make a rifle play music with a record-like disc, at which, his pursuers stop and start dancing. Though the music is less than hot, combing tunes like LONDON BRIDGE and GLOW WORM, but they are so enthralled they merge together to form a huge phonograph, with an amplifier horn formed from the end of the rifle.",
