    "Plot": "The film centers around a love triangle between 2 brothers, Christian and Cain, who have been in love with the same girl since they were children, a girl they call ~ Georgia.... Through the film we explore the love triangle between Christian, Cain, and the girl they call Georgia... Over the course of the movie, we see how their love affairs have influenced and dominated the outcomes of their lives and how their lifelong romance has affected the small and very close knit rural town in which they live, as well as those closest to them. Theirs is a love-hate relationship and it mirrors their relationship to the town in which they can't escape... From the boys' alcoholic-widower-father \"Big Harold\" who just so happens to be the town Preacher, to Georgia's aunt Maggie, the bar owner who runs the world's oldest profession out of her small dive-bar; to the new girl in town that everyone calls \"Hollywood;\" we uncover all of the dirty little secrets this small town has to offer...",
