      "description": "A hilariously inept poverty row western starring Jack Perrin. The plot and dialog are worse than comic-book juvenile. The acting wouldn't pass muster for the cast of a middle school play. The fistfights are more like friendly wrestling matches. This one is a real laugher, but to be fair some of the continunity gaffs might be the result of the botched TV edit. Written and directed by Robert J Horner. Released in 1930. Complete print (1949 TV edit)",
