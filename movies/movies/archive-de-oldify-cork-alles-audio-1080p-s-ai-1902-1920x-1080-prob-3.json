      "description": "This film shows many interesting, wonderful scenes of the city of Cork 120 years ago. Cork lies near the South coast of Ireland on the river Lee and is the second largest city in the Republic of Ireland.  Among other, this film shows horse-drawn carriages and early trams in Patrick street, a Tram Ride from King Street to Patrick's Bridge, the Grand Parade, congregations leaving St. Mary's Dominican Church and St.Patricks church, a ride from Blarney to Cork on Cork & Muskerry Light Railway, the construction and panoramic view of Cork's 1902 Exhibition Grounds, followed by its opening by Cork's Lord Mayor, the Albert Quay followed by scenes on the river Lee including a boat race as part of the Cork Regatta, and finally a parade of Regiments returning from the Boer War (in South Africa) to their Victoria Barracks. For precise details, please read the timeline below. The original B&W film fragments have been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, enhanced, restored and colorized with modern A.I. software tools. Please remember that this footage is very old and the quality will vary. Source: Various Music: Howard Harper Barnes, Rune Dale, Christian Andersen a.o.
