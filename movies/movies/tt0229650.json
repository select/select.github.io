    "Plot": "This movie is the equivalent of the American Goodfellas.  It details the true to life situations in urban Mexico and what an average driver encounters throughout their lifetime.  Filled with everything from Wacky sidekicks, an evil knife-wielding villian, a girl-on-girl fight, muggins, a bar fight and a butt naked double-speed benny hill-esque running scene.Using ridiculously strong language and local dialect, this may not be easy to view for most \"High School Spanish\" students, but the action translates well in any language.Definitely a shinning mexican film",
