      "description": "When the Miller family discovers a mysterious gift outside their home on Christmas Eve, they could never imagine it would contain the power to doom their idyllic mountain community. The gift contains a snow globe with a perfect reflection of their own town inside. When they shake it, whatever happens inside the snow globe, happens to their town for real. But when buttons on the snow globe unleash a series of terrible disasters on the town, the family must band together and find a way to destroy it – before it’s too late.\n2011.
