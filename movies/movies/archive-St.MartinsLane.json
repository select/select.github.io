      "description": "This print is sharper and with less shrill audio than the existing IA copies. A seriocomic tale of London buskers (street performers) costarring Charles Laughton and Vivien Leigh with a solid supporting cast. A neglected classic that's a must for Laughton and Leigh fans. Directed by Tim Whelan. UK release 1938. US release 1940. Complete print. a.k.a. \"Sidewalks of London\" TRIVIA: First telecast September 11, 1949 on KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles. The theaters shown during the opening credits were later completely destroyed in the London blitz.",
