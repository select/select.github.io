Set in Egypt in 1900, the story follows three Egyptologists—John Bray, Sir Giles Dalrymple, and Professor Eugene Dubois—who discover the tomb of  Ra-Antef, the son of Ramesses VIII. They are joined by Dubois' daughter, Annette, who is also Bray's fiancée. The expedition is funded by American showman Alexander King, who plans to exhibit the artifacts in London. However, upon their return, the mummy is revived, leading to a series of deadly events as it seeks revenge on those who disturbed its tomb.",
