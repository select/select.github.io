      "description": "Call Northside 777 is a 1948 American drama film directed by Henry Hathaway . The film parallels the true story of a Chicago newspaper reporter who proved that a man jailed for murder 11 years previously was wrongly convicted. James Stewart stars as the persistent journalist and Richard Conte plays the imprisoned Frank Wiecek. Wiecek is based on Joseph Majczek , who was wrongly convicted of the murder of a Chicago policeman in 1932, one of the worst years of organized crime during prohibition.",
