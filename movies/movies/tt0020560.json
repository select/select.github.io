      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of his few talkie starring roles before his untimely death, Robert Ames stars as an innocent young man who escapes prison and flees the police. Willard Mack directs and stars as a detective who tries to hunt him down, before realizing he may be innocent.  I've uploaded two versions of this film, one with slightly higher quality but a small watermark that periodically appears, and one without that watermark. Watermarked version sourced from \"PizzaFlix\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-3ONWjKgg",
