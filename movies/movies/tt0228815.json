    "Plot": "Home for their Christmas vacation, Jack and Edward, roommates and rivals, learn that Helen is planning a party for her \"kiddies\" on Christmas Eve. Anxious to hold her regard, Jack orders a dozen orchids. Helen is undecided which of the boys shall act as Santa Claus. She settles on Jack and has half finished a note to him, when Edward is announced. He has intercepted the florist boy and relieved him of Jack's flowers, which he presents to Helen as his own. In return for this attention, Helen asks Edward to be her Santa Claus. Helen and Edward have just set out to get a pack of toys when Jack calls. He decides to wait for Helen and sees the unfinished letter. Overjoyed, he buys a ring for Helen and a Santa costume for himself. Helen, absorbed in her plans, is unresponsive to his protestations of love. On Christmas Eve, the children are waiting for Santa and Edward is arranging his toys. In the kitchen, the drivers are enjoying the Yuletide bounty. The one discordant note is Binks Mulligan, a poor cabby. He is thinking sadly of the joyless Christmas awaiting his desolate family. In the meantime. Jack, dressed as Santa, decides to deliver the ring, his Christmas present to Helen. As Edward finishes his Santa make-up, Binks locks him in the closet and slides out of the window with the toy bag. Jack, turning in at the entrance, encounters the would-be burglar, overpowers him, hears his tale of woe, and relents when he learns of Edward's imprisonment. He presents him with several bills and a wish for a Merry Christmas. Jack shoulders the bag, and is mistaken for Edward by Helen. He plays the part of Santa and discloses his identity to the maid with instructions to release Edward. When Helen enters, he slips the ring on her finger, removing his whiskers. Jack whispers something in Helen's ear. The butler enters, supporting Edward, who is somewhat withered. \"Allow me to present the future Mrs. Santa Claus,\" says Jack, \"the wedding date is not set, but -send orchids.\"",
