    "Plot": "An old German music teacher has Scrappy running scales on the violin, while Pete the Parrot laughs at every mistake. this makes the teacher angry, but Pete will have his way.It's a pretty good Scrappy cartoon in which he doesn't get to do anything funny. Instead the gags concentrate on Pete and the professor, who speaks double-dutch and has an explosive temper, like Billy Gilbert in a Laurel &amp; Hardy short. There's a long and fairly involved version of Sousa's \"Stripes and Stripes Forever\" performed on a variety of instruments which are around the studio.",
