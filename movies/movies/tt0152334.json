    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie are playing Cowboys and Indians, when a pony arrives from Hollywood -- the returns form the cartoons must have been very good. Scrappy tries to ride him, but the pony throws him. When Oopie gives him sugar cubes, however, the pony take a liking to him.It's a pretty good Scrappy cartoon from this period, with some good gags -- Oopie uses a feather duster as a war bonnet -- and some interesting point-of-view shots. Although parts of it, like the sugar cubes, are a bit too sweet for my taste, it changed gears often enough to keep me interested throughout.",
