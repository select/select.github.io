      "description": "CAUTION: I recommend downloading, not streaming. When I tried to stream, the dialogue went out-of-sync. It might work well with faster broadband. Lost in the Wash tells the story of a filmmaker (Blake Mitchell) who becomes a participant in his own screenplay after his girlfriend breaks up with him. After Blake kills off one of his characters (Lucy), another character (Thomas) blatantly ignoring the boundaries of reality, telephones Blake and demands that Lucy be brought back from the dead. Blake continues to work his way out of this cinematic rabbit hole as a means of discovering where his life went wrong. The harder he tries, however, the more lost he becomes. And the only people who can help him are the ones that he himself invented.",
