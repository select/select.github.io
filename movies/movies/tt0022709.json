    "Plot": "Bosko rides to the zoo on his bicycle as Honey sits on the handlebars. As the two sweethearts are about to walk in, Honey hears the lion roaring. Bosko assures her the lion won't hurt her. Sure enough, Honey remains safe on this outing; but Bosko soon finds himself in great peril. His troubles begin with an ostrich that steals his derby. Later, a porcupine will be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the real trouble starts when Bosko spanks a misbehaving monkey, which incurs the wrath of the monkey's enormous father. It won't be long before Bosko wins the narrowest of escapes from the ape, a snake and that roaring lion.",
