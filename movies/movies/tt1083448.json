    "Plot": "Jules Daly is struggling to raise her orphaned niece and nephew (Maggie and Milo) alone, but it isn't easy after getting downsized out of her antique sales job while Milo rebels against the death of his parents through petty theft. With things looking bleak for Christmas, an English butler named Paisley arrives with an invitation for all to come see the kids' emotionally distant grandfather who lives in Castlebury Hall, somewhere near Liechtenstein. With nothing to hold them back, they go, but the grandfather - Edward, Duke of Castlebury - is rather cold over their visit to his castle. So is his other surviving son, Ashton, Prince of Castlebury. Before long, they're all having a good time and looking forward to hosting a Christmas Eve ball, but Jules overhears a conversation from which she draws a wrong conclusion.",
