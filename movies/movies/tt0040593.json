      "description": "There's Danger! Terror! Mystery! With a Killer on the Loose! Julie Weston and her aunt, Hattie, own and operate a candy-store in Harlem. A wealthy business man, Albert Marshall, and his wayward son, Jim Marshall, swindle the women out of the store. Later, Albert Marshall is found murdered, and there are several suspects, including Marshall's secretary and a blackmailer. (from IMDb ) Stepin Fetchit is in this film, and (fair warning) his persona is just as irritating and offensive as in his earlier Hollywood work, but serves as a contrast to the other characters onscreen. Fetchit had trouble finding much Hollywood work in the '40s, despite being friends with John Ford and other successful filmmakers.",
