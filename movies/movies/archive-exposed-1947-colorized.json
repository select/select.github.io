      "description": "A beautiful female private detective (Adele Mara) is hired by a wealthy businessman to check up on his stepson (Mark Roberts), the heir to the family fortune, who has reportedly been withdrawing large amounts of money from his bank account. But as she starts investigating, people start getting killed. Adele Mara as Belinda Prentice Mark Roberts as William Foresman III Lorna Gray as Judith Bentry Robert Armstrong as Inspector Prentice William Haade as Iggy Broty Bob Steele as \"Chicago\" Harry Shannon as Severance Charles Evans as Jonathan Lowell I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
