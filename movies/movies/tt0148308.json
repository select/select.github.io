    "Plot": "Sourpuss the cat isn't having any luck catching fish; but dumb old Gandy Goose rows nearby and pulls a fish out of the water the moment he drops his hook into the sea. And he continues pulling out fish faster than he could pluck gumballs from a bowl. Meanwhile, Sourpuss threatens his bait at gunpoint, demanding that the cowering worm do his job. A minute later, the worm bursts back out of the sea and dives terrified back into his can. Sourpuss knows there must be a big fish down there, and so he dives into the sea himself and puts the hook in the sleeping fish's mouth. Unfortunately, once he pulls him up, the big fish falls off the hook, leaving a smaller fish. That one falls off, leaving a still smaller fish. It happens again and a pelican flies by to steal the tiny fish that remains. Sourpuss decides that his only chance to get a fish is to go into partnership with the easy-going goose. Little does he guess that this fishy little alliance will lead to both of them getting chased by a whale.",
