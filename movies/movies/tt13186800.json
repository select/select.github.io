      "description": "***This film is under license from ITN Distribution. All rights reserved.***\n\nKill Cavalry - U.S. General Judson Kilpatrick is known to many as \"Kill Cavalry,\" not for the number of enemy troops he has killed, but his own, due to brash decisions that lead to heavy Federal casualties. On a mission to eliminate  C.S. General Joseph Wheeler, Kilpatrick devises a plan to take over the small town of Barnwell, S.C., hoping to draw out Wheeler. But unbeknownst to Kilpatrick, Wheeler is already one step ahead, and 'Kill Cavalry's' troops are placed in jeopardy once again.   \n\n2020\nStars: Jezibell Anat, Jerry Chesser, Alan Cope II\n\nWelcome to Movie Central.
