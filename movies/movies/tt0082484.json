      "description": "\"Quest for Fire\" is a 1981 prehistoric adventure film directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, focusing on a tribe's struggle to find fire after their source is extinguished. The film features minimal dialogue and explores themes of survival and human evolution. The language used in the film is an invented language called Ulam, created by novelist Anthony Burgess. This language, along with accompanying gestures, was designed to reflect the communication style of early humans and is integral to the film's portrayal of prehistoric life.",
