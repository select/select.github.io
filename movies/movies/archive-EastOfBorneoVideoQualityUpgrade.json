      "description": "This print's video quality isn't great. However it is a significant improvement over the other IA copy. An early talkie adventure/melodrama in which a \"white\" woman it threatened by a lustful \"oriental\" potentate. Good production values including FX is the most that can be said for this dated film thematically related to lurid pulp novels of the '20s and '30s. Directed by George Melford. Released in 1931. Complete print (minus a few missing frames)",
