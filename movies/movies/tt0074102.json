      "description": "In the Realm of the Senses  ( Ai no corrida ), by the always provocative Japanese director Nagisa Oshima, remains one of the most controversial films of all time. Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control. Less a work of pornography than of politics,  In the Realm of the Senses  is a brave, taboo-breaking milestone, still censored in its own country.",
