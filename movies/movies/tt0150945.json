    "Plot": "This is a pretty good Terrytoon about the travails of a company of fire-fighting mice. Apparently several staffers were members of the Larchmont volunteer fire company and I suspect that one of the two non-mouse characters, the enormously fat fireman wielding an ax, is a caricature. The other non-mouse is the man who calls in the fire. He wears a black coat, a derby, and carries like a banner some long underwear on which is printed \"Kosher\" in Hebrew. No \"Jewish Lightning\" jokes, though.What makes this good is the rat-a-tat pacing of the gags for the first two-thirds of the cartoon, far more typical of a Fleischer cartoon After that, it goes into two minutes of operetta, as a lady mouse is pursued by anthropomorphous flames until she is rescued by the baritone.",
