      "description": "This print is sharper and with better contrast than the previously available IA versions. “Entertaining dippy quickie” “Fun movie” “So bad it’s good fun’ “Confusing” “Best left to hardcore Lugosi fans” (IMDB reviews quotes). Bela Lugosi’s only color (cinecolor) feature film as a star, but in spite of good individual scene direction and a better than expected cast, it’s much less than we might have hoped it would be. The culprit was its badly muddled screenplay. IMDB rating 3.9. Directed by Christy Cabanne. Released in 1947. Complete print.",
