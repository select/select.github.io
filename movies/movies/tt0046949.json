The film is an adaptation of Mika Waltari's novel and features a star-studded cast including Edmund Purdom , Jean Simmons , Victor Mature , Gene Tierney , and Peter Ustinov . Set in 18th dynasty Egypt , the story revolves around Sinuhe , portrayed by Edmund Purdom , a struggling physician who inadvertently becomes a royal healer for Pharaoh Akhnaton ( Michael Wilding ). The narrative follows Sinuhe as he navigates love, ambition, and the stark realities of royal court life, particularly his obsession with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer ( Bella Darvi ). Tragedy befalls Sinuhe when he loses his adoptive parents due to his neglect, prompting him to leave the court, only to return years later with a wealth of experiences and knowledge. His journey touches on various themes such as love, betrayal, ambition, and the clash between emerging religions in ancient Egypt.",
