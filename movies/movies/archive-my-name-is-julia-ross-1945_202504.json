      "description": "She went to sleep as a secretary. Woke up a madman's bride. My Name Is Julia Ross is a 1945 American film noir thriller, directed by Joseph H. Lewis, and starring Nina Foch, Dame May Whitty, and George Macready. Plot: Unemployed Julia Ross (Nina Foch) spots a job ad for a resident personal secretary, and is hired to work a certain Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Whitty), a widow who requests that she move in with her that very night. Julia leaves her old lodgings immediately to stay with her new employer, only to inexplicably wake up two days later in a mansion overlooking the sea. Even more strangely, Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph (George Macready), now insist that she's not Julia Ross but Ralph's wife, Marion.",
