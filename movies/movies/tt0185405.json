      "description": "A skillful, essentially truthful WW2 propaganda piece on Imperial Japan that exaggerated some issues by misquotes and by quoting the so-called \"Tanaka Memorial\" which was a prewar hoax. It was produced too late in the war to receive wide distribution. Directed by Frank Capra & Joris Ivens (both uncredited). Military release 1945. Complete print. NOTE: One of a series of five Know Your Enemy and Know Your Ally films that were planned. However this one and \"Know Your Ally: Britain\" were the only two produced. \"Know Your Ally: Britain\" is in the Short Format Films Collection (shorts).",
