      "description": "1942 directed by Wallace Fox starring Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Tristram Coffin, Elizabeth Russell, Minerva Urecal, Angelo Rossitto, Joan Barclay, Kenneth Harlan and Vince Barnett. Mad scientist Lugosi murders young brides by sending them a poison orchid. He then trucks away the bodies in his hearse and, when he's back in his laboratory, extracts fluid from them to inject into his aging wife, a super-biotch who can't stand a wrinkle.  This copy has been sharpened up a bit.",
