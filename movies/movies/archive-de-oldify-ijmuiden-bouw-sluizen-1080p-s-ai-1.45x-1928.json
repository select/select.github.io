      "description": "The building of the locks at IJmuiden in The Netherlands nearly a century ago in 1928 Not an elaborate project such as the building of the Panama Canal, but still a mayor technological achievement. These locks separate the North Sea from the Northsea channel, a hand-dug, about 21 km long and more that 110 meters wide canal that runs to the harbour of Amsterdam. This canal was dug between 1865 and 1878, mainly by means of manual labour. For more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_Canal and https://www.kfw.de/stories/economy/infrastructure/sluice-ijmuiden/ The original film has been dramatically restored, motion-stabilized, speed corrected and colorized with the latest A.I. software",
