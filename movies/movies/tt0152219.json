      "description": "This was a Krazy Kat cartoon made for Charles Mintz and distributed by Columbia. While the studio originally based the character on the comic strip created by George Herriman, by 1931 he was changed in design and personality to be more like Walt Disney's popular Mickey Mouse (whose cartoons, ironically, were also distributed by Columbia at the time).
