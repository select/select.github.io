      "description": "Newlyweds visit Las Vegas and then a small, apparently deserted island. He takes the boat and goes off to work, she takes off her clothes and goes for a swim. Unfortunately there is a homicidal fisherman lurking on the island.  Not quite a roughie and not quite a nudist movie. ",
