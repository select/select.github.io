When a mother roadrunner bird is killed by a coyote, Chico spends the next several weeks finding food and caring for her baby chicks. The boy is deeply saddened one day when the gro wn birds fly away, until one bird returns to the hut. Chico bonds with the bird but doesn't realize the depth of their relationship -- until one fateful day when the bird saves his life.",
