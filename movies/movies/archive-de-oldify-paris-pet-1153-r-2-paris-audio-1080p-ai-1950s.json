      "description": "This film consists of a montage of raw film footage that probably was intended for a movie or a documentary about Paris, about 70 years ago. It was shot on 35mm film and therefore of high quality. The additional restoration and colorization by means of A.I. software has further increased the quality and viewing pleasure of this film. It only lasts just over 5 minutes, but does show many of the famous points-of-interest in Paris like the Jardin du Luxembourg, a steam tug on the river Seine, The Notre Dame (largely destroyed by a fire on 15 April 2019), the Hotel de Ville (Townhall), The Champs Elisées, The Eiffel Tower, Place de L'Étoile with the Arc de Triomphe both during day and by night, and finally a beautiful pan shot across Paris with the Sacre Coeur on the hill of Montmartre in the distance. The titles of the used music more of less coincide with the subjects in the various film shots. This music is by contemporary composers: Joe E. Lee - Les Cafes De Paris Trabant 33 - Early Morning in Paris Trailer Worx - Night Above Paris.",
