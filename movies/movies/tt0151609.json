While preparing them for his meal Molly discovers what's going on and comes to the rescue, pleading with the man to release the ducks. A fight ensues, and the hunter is on the verge of winning when the Native woman joins in the fight and scares him away. Molly and the ducks return to the wagon and all is well.",
