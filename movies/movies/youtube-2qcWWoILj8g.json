      "description": "A bored Man in the Moon hitches a ride to Earth on the tails of a passing comet and starts to explore the fantastical creatures and sights of a new planet. But all is not well - the Moon Man's absence from his post means that all the world's children are unable to sleep. Before the President can capture him, they must join forces to return him to his rightful place in the sky.\n\nDirectors: Stephan Schesch, Sarah Clara Weber\n2012\nStars: Katharina Thalbach, Ulrich Tukur, Corinna Harfouch \n\nEdited for YouTube ad standards\r\n\r\nMORE Popcornflix MOVIES, FREE on YouTube!\r\n\r\n Action: https://bit.ly/2XC8pvv\r\n Romance: https://bit.ly/2NVnIQ2\r\n Horror: https://bit.ly/2LeNNaK\r\n Crime: https://bit.ly/2NK201z\r\n Drama: https://bit.ly/2G6Uasy\r\n Comedy:  https://bit.ly/2LPCNQD\r\n Western: https://bit.ly/2S7FRc4\r\n Popcornflix Channel page: https://bit.ly/2Saak9p\r\n\r\nWatch more free movies and TV series at Popcornflix.com, or on the Popcornflix app available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Chromecast, and AppleTV.\r\n\r\n#Popcornflix, Full length free movies and TV series.\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Popcornflix\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Popcornflixnews\r\nPopcornflix is owned/operated by Screen Media Ventures",
