      "description": "This is a surreal little movie by Billy Wilder's much-less talented older brother, W. Lee Wilder. It was originally released in a 1:85 aspect ratio. This is an attempt to recreate the original aspect ratio using the best public domain print I could find. The 16mm print seemed to be already slightly cropped and a true 1:85 ratio looked too cramped. This version has been blown-up and cropped at about 1:75, not the correct ratio, but much closer to the intended composition. Killers from Space Killers from Space  is a  1954  American  black and white   science fiction   feature   film , produced and directed by  W. Lee Wilder (brother of  Billy Wilder ) from an original, commissioned screenplay by his son  Myles Wilder  and their regular collaborator William Raynor, and starring  Peter Graves  and  Barbara Bestar .
