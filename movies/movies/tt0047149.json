      "description": "This is a surreal little movie by Billy Wilder's much-less talented older brother, W. Lee Wilder. It was originally released in a 1:85 aspect ratio. This is an attempt to recreate the original aspect ratio using the best public domain print I could find. The 16mm print seemed to be already slightly cropped and a true 1:85 ratio looked too cramped. This version has been blown-up and cropped at about 1:75, not the correct ratio, but much closer to the intended composition.
