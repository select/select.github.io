    "Plot": "Dr. Hale, fresh out of medical school and having opened his own practice with no patients, is trying to impress a father and his daughter, the latter potentially to be his first patient. But Dr. Hale becomes more enamored with her as a potential girlfriend, especially when her father chooses not to have her treated by him. To help out a colleague in the office building, Dr. Hale ends up getting drunk with his new friend, leading to the pair getting into some misadventures with a policeman out on the street, and in a hotel. Dr. Hale's inebriation brings him into the realm of the beautiful girl again, their further misadventures high above the streets of the city which may provide some keys as to how they should live their future.",
