    "Plot": "Two families, both French and naturally excitable. The two wives were bicycle fiends. Daily spins along the boulevard were indulged in, each woman envious of the other. Each derided the other's graceful (?) riding. Things are ripe when they bumped into each other. A spill, a broken wheel, two irate women, two hubbies aroused to a fury, demanding satisfaction. Of course, you realize that the answer is a duel. There is a duel and the most exciting one ever precipitated.",
