    "Plot": "The Swiss Cheese Family Robinson, a trio of shipwrecked mice (mother, father and daughter), float on a raft made of Swiss cheese, which grows smaller as its passengers grow hungrier. The raft is nearly gone when the mice are attacked by swordfish. A turtle, making like a motorboat, rescues the mice and deposits them on an island. But they aren't safe yet. The island is overrun by cannibal cats, who quickly capture the poor mice and begin their ritual dance in preparation for the feast. Luckily, while on the raft, the father had sent off a message in a bottle. With verbal assistance from the off-screen narrator, the anthropomorphic bottle finds its way to Miami Beach, where Mighty Mouse is relaxing. Mighty Mouse, with more nudging from the narrator, finds the bottle, reads the message and flies off to the rescue.",
