      "description": "In our series about old Rotterdam, here is another video about this city in war time. On 31 March 1943 the American Air Force deliberately attempted to bombard the harbour and shipbuilding facilities in Rotterdam-West (The Netherlands). Unfortunately the bombers did not hit their target but in stead bombarded residential areas in the Western part of the Schiedamseweg and the Bospolder & Tussendijken quarters. Because the bombers were stationed in Britain, the RAF got the blame from the pro-German Dutch commentator who can be heard in this film. In total 326 residents died. This bombardment is not very well know and is thus regularly referred to as \"The Forgotten Bombardment\". The original film has been motion-stabilized, restored, enhanced and colorized by means of modern A.I. software. Source: Beeld En Geluid.",
