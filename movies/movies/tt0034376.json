    "Plot": "Porky hosts a radio program, where animals tell their stories. The guest star is Kansas City Kitty, the best mouser in the country. She tells the story of her life, including her marriage to Tom Collins, the birth of Little Patrick (not necessarily in that order), and the turning point of her life. The mice have plotted out a major operation like gangsters. They sneak out and kidnap Patrick and hold him hostage. The mice soon have the run of the place, raiding the fridge, and generally harassing Kitty, who is distraught. But Patrick escapes, and Kitty gets her revenge. For her story, Porky gives her a present: a wimpy little mouse that scares her.",
