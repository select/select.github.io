      "description": "Hello, friends. The Count is back for the attack one more time with the last volume of Shock Show. But do not weep, for we have a special presentation of the classic anthology film VAULT OF HORROR directed by Roy Ward Baker and featuring a very talented cast. A so-so print of the PG rated version, sadly but still a bloody good show. Thank you for tuning in to Shock Show. The Count bids you farewell.",
