      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The Unholy Night is mostly remembered now for a small role played by Boris Karloff and for being directed by actor Lionel Barrymore. Still, it was moody and atmospheric enough that contemporary reviews were mostly positive. Version sourced from \"PizzaFlix\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCF_auveQzQ",
