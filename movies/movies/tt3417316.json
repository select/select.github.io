      "description": "LEAVES OF THE TREE is a beautifully crafted,  thought-provoking film that pushes the line between humanity and divinity.  Filmed on location in Sicily, at the Ancient Doric Temple of Segesta, the Castle of Erice, the Harbor, Castle and Churches of Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, and the Tonnara of Scopello.  In LEAVES OF THE TREE, the past, present and future intersect through the ongoing struggles of doubt, belief and faith; especially for all that come in contact with the leaves of an Olive Tree with mysterious healing powers, that may or not be linked directly to Jesus Christ.\n2015.
