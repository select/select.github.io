    "Plot": "The Cheeseville Cat Defense is too effective. There is no way the marauding cats can get in and capture the mice. After several failed attempts, the leader of the cats hits on a plan. Instead of trying to break in, why not lure the mice out? And who better to do it than Mighty Mouse? Mighty Mouse is taking a well-earned vacation. But a mouse newscaster appears on TV, announcing that the dam has burst and is about to flood Cheeseville. He doesn't know that a cat had gutted his TV and used a mouse hand puppet to make the false announcement from inside the television set. Mighty Mouse commands the citizens of Cheeseville to evacuate and take shelter. It's almost too late before he learns that the dam is as sturdy as ever.",
