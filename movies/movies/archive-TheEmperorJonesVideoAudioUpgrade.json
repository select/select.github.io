      "description": "This glitch-free print is sharper than the existing IA copy. The audio quality also has been improved. Paul Robeson's tour de force performance in the taboo-busting partial adaptation of Eugene O'Neal's play. Universally recognized today as a landmark film, in 1933 it was rejected by a large segment of the African-American community. In one respect they were justified. \"The Emperor Jones\" does reenforce negative black stereotypes. Directed by Dudley Murphy (& William C de Mille uncredited). Released in 1933. Complete print (see note). NOTE: the runtime of this print is 75 minutes. The original 80 minute release no longer exists. CAST NOTE: Billie Holiday's uncredited screen debut.",
