      "description": "Caught lurking at a crime scene, the Shadow is forced to pretend to be an attorney and help an aging millionaire re-write his will. When the old man is murdered, he tries to determine who did it and why. Rod La Rocque as Lamont Cranston Norman Ainsley as Hendricks Lynn Anders as Marcia Delthern James Blakeley as Jasper Delthern Walter McGrail as Winstead Comstock Bruce Kellogg as Humphrey Comstock Cy Kendall as Brossett Kenneth Harlan as Captain Breen Wilson Benge as Wellington John Carnivale as Warran Berranger I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but it's as good as I can get it at present. Hopefully a more professional job can be done someday.",
