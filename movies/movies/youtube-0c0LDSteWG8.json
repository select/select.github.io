      "description": "Based on Masha Traub's story \"The House in the South\". An enterprising broker rented a house by the sea to several families at once. So, by chance, in one \"ark\" several completely different women with children are forced to \"sail on the waves of life\". After a tangle of eccentric, funny events, showdowns, it seemed that they would understand each other, but the appearance of the owner of the house returning from the voyage, and unaware that his friend, to whom he gave the keys to the house, handed it over, violates the already almost emerged Chekhovian atmosphere.\n\nYear of production: 2016\n\nDirected by: Storozheva Vera\nWritted by: Olga Popova, Olga Zhukova\nMysic: Poteenko Yury\nOperator: Khamraev Ulugbek\nProduction Designer: Filenko Sergey\n\nStarting: Khodchenkova Svetlana, Pegova Irina, Popova Olga, Dvorzhetskaya Nina, Anaskina Nika, Ursulyak Daria, Vdovichenkov Vladimir, Bityukov Maxim, Simacheva Polina, Isakova Victoria, Vasilkov Oleg",
