      "description": "“Bright musical comedy” “Nice lighthearted trifle” “An absolute delight” (IMDB reviews quotes). A London bobby (Sterling Holloway) romances a cockney flower seller (Betty Balfour) in this semi-musical remake of “Squibs” (1921). It’s no Busby Berkeley/Warner Brothers spectacular, but it is an engaging light comedy with a solid British cast. IMDB rating 5.9. Directed by Henry Edwards. Released in 1935 (UK and IRE only).
