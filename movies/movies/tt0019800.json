      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This circus-set dramedy was one of Clara Bow's early talkies and follows her character who works to save the career of her crush, a balancing act performer. While box office and contemporary reviews don't seem to have been anything of note, modern reviews make sure to highlight Ms. Bow's performance and unique setting. ",
