      "description": "The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) Universal International Pictures Scott Carey begins to shrink because of exposure to a combination of radiation and insecticide. His wife does her best to try to accomodate his condition, but medical science is powerless to help him. Grant Williams as Scott Carey Randy Stuart as Louise Carey April Kent as Clarice Bruce Paul Langton as Charlie Carey Raymond Bailey as Doctor Thomas Silver William Schallert as Doctor Arthur Bramson Frank J. Scannell as Barker I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
