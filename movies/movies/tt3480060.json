      "description": "COLD IRON IS A TITANIC COMEDY (The Neoist Beach Edit...) \"A tin-foil road-trip to Florida & the British Museum, in faster isolating language that dialogues over the electric kettle of Toronto's City Hall and rotates in perpetual stillness towards a tsunami of row-boat performances.
