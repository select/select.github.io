      "description": "Produced in 1912, this film has three directors credited which might explain its quirky jumps in scenes. Algie is played by Billy Quirk in a performance which got the film mentioned in the movie \"The Celluloid Closet\" which discussed gays in early movies that were otherwise straight.",

    "Plot": "Algie is in love with Clarice Jackson, but Clarice's father will have none of him. To a real man Algie is unendurable. His \"sissy\" manner makes him look like a jellyfish. Algie cajoles and is persistent, so in order to be rid of him, Mr. Jackson advises Algie that he may have his daughter, provided he goes out west for a year and \"makes good.\" Algie thinks well of the proposition. After many unnecessary preparations he departs. His arrival out west among the rough and ready cowboys gives these hearty men of the plains many hours of amusement. Algie is soon tied down to a job and is bunked with one of the toughest specimens of the ranch. His constant association with this man brings him in touch with many hard places and rough experiences. These hard knocks change Algie completely. After a year expires, Algie comes east, a wealthy miner and to the staggering astonishment of all, asks for the hand of Clarice. He emphasizes his claims with a big six-shooter.",
