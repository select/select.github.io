The family bribes a government official to take the heat off its young heir. The Yoons are so rich, they have no qualms letting the young bag-man cull the cash he's to deliver, from a storeroom jammed with 6 foot high stacks of money. Mr. Joo seems too obsequious and obedient to worry about, but when the wife of the company CEO sees on her spy cameras, that her husband is having an affair with their maid, the infuriated matriarch orders Mr. Joo to have sex with her, then entrusts the befuddled Mr. Joo with monitoring the video screens.",
