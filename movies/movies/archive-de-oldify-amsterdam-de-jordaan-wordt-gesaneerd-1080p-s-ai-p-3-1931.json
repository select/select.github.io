      "description": "This is a colorized and restored film about Amsterdam's Jordaan quarters almost a century ago. The Amsterdam municipal council took the decision around 1930 to overhaul this dilapidated and impoverished neighborhood. The film shows fascinating images of how the poor live in and on the streets of the Jordaan. The warehouses on the Rapenburgergracht, the Montelbaanstoren, primitive shops, a \"sharpensliep\" and the Jodenhout gardens behind the houses are also shown. It is a misunderstanding to think that the Jordaan is/was a Jewish neighborhood.",
