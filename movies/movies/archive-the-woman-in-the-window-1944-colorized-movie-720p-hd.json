It tells the story of a middle-aged psychology professor who kills in self-defense the lover of a young femme fatale he just met while his family is on vacation. The film is based on J. H. Wallis ' 1942 novel Once Off Guard . Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson , having written the script for The Grapes of Wrath (1940), was invited by International Pictures to a picture deal, and The Woman in the Window was chosen as its premiere project. The term \"film noir\" originated as a genre description in part because of The Woman in the Window .",
