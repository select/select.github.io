    "Plot": "Alice and her friends put on a show. After a brief overture, act one: A saloon; Alice enters, and shoots down two bad guys. Tubby O'Brien and his gang then enter the audience; Alice's cast leaves out of fear. Alice decides to tell stories of her wild west adventures, and we finally get two brief animated sequences: Alice riding atop a stagecoach, shooting at Indians, and Alice as Sheriff, taking care of a bad guy who steals a safe. The overall feel is much more like an Our Gang short than the rest of the Alice series.",
