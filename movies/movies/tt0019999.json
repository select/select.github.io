    "Plot": "Stanley and Oliver protest that they were only bystanders to the raid, but are hauled off to a prison labor camp anyway. They proceed with their usual mayhem, Stanley getting his pick stuck in Oliver's coat, Oliver chopping down a tree which just happens to contain the guard lookout post. When the Governor's party happens by, Oliver accidentally pokes a hole in his car's radiator, then attempts to stop the leak by filling the radiator with rice. The result is melee with all involved throwing clumps of soggy rice at each other.",
