      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with poster art and drive-in style audio. Burning this to disc is real easy: Download the zipped folder, open it, and extract the VIDEO TS folder. Grab a blank DVD and burn the VIDEO TS folder onto it, that's the easiest way.  I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD feature a double-bill of WEREWOLF OF WASHINGTON & GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE, along with the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show!",
