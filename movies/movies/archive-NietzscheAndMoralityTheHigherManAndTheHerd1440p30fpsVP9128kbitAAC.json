We investigate how a herd morality develops, and the threat it poses to the existence of great individuals (higher human beings). We conclude by examining the existence of herd morality in the modern world. ============================================ Sign up for our mailing list: http://academyofideas.com/newsletter/ Get the transcript: https://academyofideas.com/2017/01/nietzsche-and-morality/ ============================================ Recommended Reading: On the Genealogy of Morality - Friedrich Nietzsche - http://amzn.to/2k9QB8F (affiliate link) Beyond Good and Evil - Friedrich Nietzsche - http://amzn.to/2kLg4Zd (affiliate link) Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is - Friedrich Nietzsche - http://amzn.to/2kNkQBs (affiliate link) Nietzsche and Morality - Brian Leiter - http://amzn.to/2kLN2cd (affiliate link)",
