Yaqui Jack is shot but escapes and reaches the camp of Webb Dunham, who treats his wounds. They separate with Webb going to the ranch of his brother who has been murdered. Suspicion turns on Matt, who claims title to the brother's ranch, and has Webb brutally beaten after ordering him from the property.
