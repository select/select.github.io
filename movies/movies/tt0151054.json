    "Plot": "Paul Terry's staff turns out a decent cartoon enlivened by its synchronized sound track; there are a few voice overs, but mostly cries for help by the cartoon mice. Nonetheless, we are still firmly in the silent era in terms of of how the movie is put together and Paul Terry in particular: short sight gags connected by a loose plot -- the Indians/cats are attacking the settlers/mice. The sound track serves to replace a small orchestra or theater organ and it does so in a decent if not exceptional fashion. We are treated to the absurdist gags typical of silent cartoons as the cats slither like snakes and a moose suddenly flaps its antlers to fly away. The end result is typical Terry product: worth a look but not exceptionally good.",
