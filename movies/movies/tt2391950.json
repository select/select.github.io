    "Plot": "Cory Weissman was a high school basketball star who scored 1,000 points and was expected to be a standout athlete at Gettysburg College. Cory is an upbeat, hard-working freshman getting ready to take over as point guard but, at the beginning of his sophomore year, he suffers a catastrophic stroke. Only quick action by his best friend \"Pops\" and a race to save his life in the athletic training room prevent him from dying. The film chronicles Cory's against-all-odds comeback from this life-threatening stroke with the help of his mother Tina, a physical therapist, as well as the encouragement of both his dedicated basketball coach and his girlfriend, who loves Cory just the way he is. Despite the many challenges he faces--the difficult physical therapy, an emotional break-up with the girl he loves, and dark moments that threaten to consume him--Cory prevails, with the love and support of his best friend, his family, his school and, most importantly, his own indomitable spirit.",
