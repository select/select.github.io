      "description": "A Fantastical Meal 1900 ‘ 'Le Repas Fantastique’ Director: Georges Méliès Plot: Two women and a man, attempting to have dinner, find themselves confronted with magical happenings: the chairs move, the soup tureen grows, boots appear from it, the table legs change length, the table appears and reappears. A ghost, dancing on the table, turns into a box of dynamite and explodes, and the man begins tumbling manically around the room. Release: The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 311 in its catalogues. It was imitated by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company film An Animated Luncheon.",
