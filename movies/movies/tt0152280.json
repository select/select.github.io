    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie are put to sleep by the Sand Man and dream of a visit to fairy land. However, when an ogre kidnaps Oopie, Scrappy must muster his news friends to rescue his companion.It looks like Dick Huemer had been leafing through some books illustrated by Arthur Rackham, or some other Pre-Raphaelite artist (not Beardsley, I suspect) while planning this one. It's a relatively saccharine work by Huemer, whose ideas of Scrappy tended towards the ridiculous and childlike. Perhaps he was having an off month. Perhaps Charles Mintz had been listening to parents complain that he wasn't making nice films like Disney. In any case, he directed this one and two more, then went to work for Disney.",
