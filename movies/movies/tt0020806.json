      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This railroad drama was filmed in Montana, and also takes place in the state. It follows two railway men as they fight for the love of a woman. The film has rare \"tug-of-war\" footage between two steam locomotives, as well as the only known surviving film footage to show a dynamometer maintenance car from this era. More intriguingly, Danger Lights was the only film to be recorded in a costly widescreen format that wasn't used again until the 1950's. ",

      "description": "Danger Lights (1930) is an American pre-Code drama film directed by George B. Seitz and produced by RKO Radio Pictures. This restored and colorized public domain edition revives a thrilling story centered on railroad life, loyalty, love, and rivalry in the early 20th century. Notable for its authentic on-location railroad sequences and an early performance by Jean Arthur, the film remains one of the great examples of railroading drama from the transition period between silent and sound cinema.\n\nPlot Summary:\nSet in a bustling Montana railroad town, the story follows Dan Thorn (Louis Wolheim), a tough and respected railroad yardmaster known for his discipline and leadership. He oversees his men with strict authority, commanding both loyalty and fear. Into this world enters Larry Doyle (Robert Armstrong), a confident young railroad worker whose ambition and courage quickly make him stand out. Doyle earns the respect of the men and captures the attention of Mary Ryan (Jean Arthur), Thorn’s companion, sparking a rivalry between the two men.\n\nThe tension grows as Thorn realizes that Mary’s affection is shifting toward Doyle. Their personal conflict soon becomes entangled with their work on the railroad, where precision, bravery, and discipline mean the difference between safety and disaster. The film reaches its dramatic high point with a spectacular railroad accident and a race against time to save Thorn’s life, showcasing not just the physical risks of the industry but also the moral complexities of loyalty, sacrifice, and love.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: George B. Seitz\n• Producer: RKO Radio Pictures\n• Cinematography: J. Roy Hunt\n• Editing: Otto Ludwig\n\nStarring:\n• Louis Wolheim as Dan Thorn\n• Jean Arthur as Mary Ryan\n• Robert Armstrong as Larry Doyle\n• Hugh Herbert as Fred\n• Frank Sheridan as Ryan\n• Robert Edeson as President\n\nFilm Significance:\nDanger Lights is remembered for its authentic railroad sequences filmed on location in Montana, which provided audiences of the 1930s with a realistic glimpse into the lives of railroad workers. The film captures the transition from the silent era to early sound productions, balancing melodrama with gritty industrial realism. Jean Arthur, who would later become one of Hollywood’s most celebrated leading ladies, gives an early performance that hints at her future stardom.\n\nThe movie is also significant as one of the first features released by RKO Radio Pictures, a studio that would go on to become a major force in Hollywood’s Golden Age. Its combination of romance, danger, and industrial spectacle made it both a crowd-pleaser and a unique time capsule of railroad America.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
