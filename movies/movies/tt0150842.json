    "Plot": "A canine police officer brings in the Hare to police headquarters on the charge of resisting arrest and assaulting an officer. The Hare claims it was all the officer's fault and tells his tale of woe to the chief. In flashback, we learn that the Hare, after his infamous defeat to the Tortoise in a foot race, finally got the chance to redeem himself with another competition. This time, he doesn't indulge in overconfidence. Rather, he is so desperate to win that he resorts to a series of dirty tricks, such as burying the Tortoise alive, mailing him to Hawaii and cutting a suspension bridge underneath him. They almost work, but then the police officer steps in and turns the game around.",
