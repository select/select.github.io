      "description": "I Was a Communist for the FBI is a 1951 American FILM NOlR  crime film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Frank Lovejoy and Dorothy Hart.    The film was based on a series of stories written by Matt Cvetic, who infiltrated a local Communist Party cell for nine years and reported back to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on their activities.   The purpose of the movie is partly to warn people about the threat of Communist subversion of American society. The tone  is ultra-patriotic, with Communists portrayed as racist, vindictive, and tools of a totalitarian foreign power, the Soviet Union.   You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and read an article from FILM NOlR of the Week .  ",
