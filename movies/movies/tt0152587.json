      "description": "Half-Pint, a stage-struck baby circus elephant, is forever getting into and messing up somebody's act. Although the ringmaster thinks he is too young to perform, Half-Pint cannot resist the applause of the crowd, and is continually turning up in the center-ring in impromptu acts which are not part of the circus-manager's plan. He joins the band making music with his trunk; performs as a unicycle artist, and generally disrupts the execution of the show. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/stage-struck-1950/",
