    "Plot": "Scrappy and Oopie dawdle on their way to school the day a member of the school board is to show up and hand out diplomas. They're so late, the old-maid teacher locks the door against them. So they pull the gag of taking a false beard and having Oopie stand on Scrappy's shoulders, both in a long coat, pretending to be the school board member.That makes up about half the cartoon, so it doesn't have a chance to wear out its welcome, especially when Oopie takes the opportunity to play tricks on the teacher and the hated class grind. It's not a great cartoon, by any means, but it's fairly painless.",
