After a strange apparition, one of the oldest nurses tells her that a patient, Mr. Moore, entered the hospital a few years ago, with his body completely burned after a fire. Mr. Moore was operated on urgently by the doctors, but no one wanted to assist him. The pain and drugs had driven him mad - One night one of the nurses went to his room but his bed was empty. Nothing was heard from him anymore. A bell interrupts the story. The call comes from Mr. Moore's room.",
