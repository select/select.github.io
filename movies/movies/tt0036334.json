    "Plot": "During World War Two, Daffy Duck owns a junkyard which collects scrap metal to use in building weapons to continue the Allied fight against the Axis powers. Hitler reads about Daffy's scrap pile and about Daffy's stated intent to win the war with junk and, after throwing a fit and chewing a carpet like a mad dog, orders Daffy's scrap pile destroyed. The Nazi weapon for achieving this task is a goat that begins eating the metal in Daffy's junkyard. Inspired by spirits from America's patriotic past, Daffy soars into the air and becomes a \"Super American\" to defeat the goat and fight back against the German submarine that dispatched it. He awakens, thinking this was all a dream, and finds the German submarine at the top of his scrap pile, with a chorus of German soldiers who say, \"Next time you dream, count us out!\"",
