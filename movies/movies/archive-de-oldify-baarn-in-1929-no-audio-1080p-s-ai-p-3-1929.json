      "description": "An interesting (silent) film about the town of Baarn in The Netherlands in 1929. This film has been motion-stabilized, drastically speed-corrected, A.I. enhanced and colorized. We had to reduce the speed by nearly half because the original film was moving so fast! Baarn is a town in the province of Utrecht, more or less in the middle of The Netherlands situated on the river Eem. A famous landmark of Baarn is Paleis Soestdijk where the Grand mother (Queen Juliana) of our current King (Willem-Alexander), lived from 1948 until her death in 2004. The area was already inhabited from 8000 to 4500 BC. We would like to add more details about this film but can no longer find it in the archives of Beeld En Geluid who regrettably have changed their search engine a week ago. Please help us compose the timeline, thank you! Note: This film is without sound; we deliberately did not add any music, among other because it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find unique copyright-free music.
