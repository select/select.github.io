      "description": "Natalia Osipova as Odile Reposted from the Royal Opera House website: Swan Lake (Лебединое озеро) was Pyotr Il’yich Tchaikovsky's first score for ballet. Its 1877 premiere was poorly received, but it has since become one of the most loved of all ballets. The twinned role of the pure White Swan and the scheming, duplicitous Black Swan tests the full range of a ballerina's powers, particularly in the two great pas de deux of Acts II and III. Other highlights include the charming Dance of the Little Swans performed by a moonlit lake and sweeping ballroom waltzes in the splendour of the royal palace. Anthony Dowell's romantic interpretation returns the ballet to its 1895 origins by using the choreography of Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa. Dramatic costumes emphasize the contrast between human and spirit worlds, while glowing lanterns, shimmering fabrics and designs inspired by the work of Carl Fabergé create a magical setting.",
