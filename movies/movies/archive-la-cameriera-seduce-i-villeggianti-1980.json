      "description": "This movie's title translates to \"The maid seduces the holidaymakers\" which apparently happens in the film but it is really more of a slow movie comedy with occasional bits of nudity.  Aldo Grimaldi's movies were all over the place and he only directed 12 solo movies so perhaps he just never really developed his own style.  At any rate, there are two files for this, one with optional English subs and the other English subs on their own. Movie length is 1:32:38.",
