      "description": "Playhouse 90 is an American television  anthology drama series  that aired on  CBS  from 1956 to 1960 for a total of 133 episodes. The show was produced at  CBS Television City  in  Los Angeles, California . Since live anthology drama series of the mid-1950s usually were hour-long shows, the title highlighted the network's intention to present something unusual: a weekly series of hour-and-a-half-long dramas rather than 60-minute plays. \" Requiem for a Heavyweight \" is a teleplay written by  Rod Serling  and produced for the  live television  show  Playhouse 90  on 11 October 1956. Six years later, it was adapted into the  1962 feature film of the same name  starring  Anthony Quinn ,  Jackie Gleason ,  Mickey Rooney , and  Julie Harris . The teleplay won a  Peabody Award , the first given to an individual script in television, and helped establish Serling's reputation. The broadcast was directed by  Ralph Nelson  and is generally considered one of the finest examples of live television drama in the United States, as well as being Serling's personal favorite of his own work. Nelson and Serling won  Emmy Awards  for their work.  ",
