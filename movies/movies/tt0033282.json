Schlesinger lets Porky go, but he is confident Porky will be back. Porky's adventures begin when he tries to get past the guard at the studio gate. He manages it by disguising himself as Oliver Hardy, but he has more trouble ahead. Meanwhile, Daffy tries to convince Schlesinger that he should take over Porky's starring roles. Daffy's scheme backfires when Porky returns to get his old job back.",
