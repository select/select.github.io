      "description": "Raffles is a gentleman thief known as the Amateur Cracksman, with a penchant for art and jewelry. However, after re-uniting with his old school chum's sister Gwen, he becomes a reformed man. Then, on a weekend at her parents' country house, a necklace presents an irresistible temptation. David Niven as A.J. Raffles Olivia de Havilland as Gwen Dame May Whitty as Lady Melrose Dudley Digges as MacKenzie Douglas Walton as Bunny E.E. Clive as Barraclough Lionel Pape as Lord Melrose I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
