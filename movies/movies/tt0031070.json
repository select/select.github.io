When the firm's boss, McNeil (Holmes Herbert), learns that Johnny has embezzled some money, he fires him and has him jailed. Johnny's mother comes to the aid of her son, but he can not find work when he is released. Through Steve Carson, Johnny becomes the head of a shady firm, Business Engineers, and is making a lot of money. Madelon enters the scene again and she and Johnny are married, and he is unaware that Steve is not only double-crossing him in the business but with Madelon also.",
