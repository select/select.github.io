      "description": "For any surviving Rex Bell fans out there, he stars as the long-lost son of a ruthless cattle baron in this low-impact B-western with more plot than action. Good supporting cast and adequate production values. An entertaining oater that won’t raise your blood pressure. IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Robert Hill Released in 1936. Complete print. CAST NOTE: Rex Bell may not have been the greatest on-screen hero, but off-screen he was the cowboy who finally tamed Clara Bow by marrying her.",
