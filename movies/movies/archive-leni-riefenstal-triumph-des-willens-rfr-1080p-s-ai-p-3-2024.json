      "description": "This is the well known \"Triumph of the Will\" film made by Leni Riefenstal for the 1934 Nazi party congress (\" Reichsparteitag\")  in September1934 in Neuremberg, Germany. The film has been meticulously restored, motion-stabilized, noise-reduced and enhanced with the latest video software. It is uploaded for historic purposes to show, among other, how easily populations can and will follow and support criminal regimes in expectation of a better future. It should not be forgotten that the Nazi's came to power after a period of worldwide deep economic depression and Germany having been put in a squeeze after WW-I as the result of the Treaty of Versailles. There is also a restored and colorized version of this film on my archive.org channel.",
