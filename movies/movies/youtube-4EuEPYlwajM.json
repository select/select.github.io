      "description": "William is overcome with guilt when he finds out that his sister Sarah has gone missing. Haunted by a recurring nightmare, he decides to leave the fishing boat he calls home and heads to town to find her. But, his family’s murky history with the First-Nations locals puts his life in jeopardy. Newly reinstated detective Ivy Seymour is sent from the city to work a homicide. When the body turns out to be Sarah’s roommate, Ivy and Will’s paths cross and together they follow clues to catch a killer. Desperate to find Sarah before it’s too late, Will must confront his family’s troubled past and face his demons… no matter how real they may seem. \n2021.
