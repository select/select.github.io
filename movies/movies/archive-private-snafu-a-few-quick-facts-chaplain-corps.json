      "description": "A cartoon comedy was produced in1944 by the Department of Defense. Pvt. Snafu (animation) carelessly dives into dangerous waters, falls down steps, and sleeps while driving. Shows, by animation, the consumption of gas by airplanes. The goal was to help enlisted men with weak literacy skills learn through animated cartoons. They featured simple language, racy illustrations, mild profanity, and subtle moralizing. Private Snafu did almost everything wrong, so that his negative example taught basic lessons about secrecy, disease prevention, and proper military protocols.",
