      "description": "A sinister character (Conrad Veidt) boards the express train from Paris to Rome on the trail of a valuable Van Dyck painting, recently stolen from a Paris gallery. Much to his annoyance he finds the train a hotbed of intrigue, populated with a motley assortment of passengers, including adulterous lovers, a annoyingly sociable golf fanatic (Gordon Harker), a French police inspector (Frank Vosper) and an American silent film star (Esther Ralston), any one of whom could have the painting he desperately seeks. (Remade in 1948 as \"Sleeping Car to Trieste\" with the scenario changed to a stolen diplomatic diary aboard the Orient Express.) Conrad Veidt as Zurta Esther Ralston as Asta Marvelle Harold Huth as George Grant Cedric Hardwicke as Alistair McBain Joan Barry as Mrs. Maxted Gordon Harker as Tom Bishop Donald Calthrop as Poole Hugh Williams as Tony Frank Vosper as M. Jolif Finlay Currie as Sam the Publicist Eliot Makeham as Mills Muriel Aked as Spinster I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
