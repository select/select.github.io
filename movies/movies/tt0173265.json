    "Plot": "For those who thought \"Reefer Madness\" was the first exploitation movie you'll be interested to know that the genre was alive and well during the silent era.  \"Street of Forgotten Women\" is the usual potboiler about a rich girl who is disowned by her father when she decides she wants a career in show business.  After sinking her money in a stage production which immediately flops, she's forced to try and earn a living dancing in a saloon in her underwear (which sounds far more erotic in the telling of it than actually watching it on the screen).  Even worse, she is forced into prostitution in a slum apartment that just happens to be owned by (have you already guessed it??) HER FATHER!!!!!  And after the requisite happy ending you'll find that the biggest surprise is that the entire movie runs only about 40 minutes (!!!)  Still, for fans of the exploitation genre, this is a rare chance to get a glimpse of early \"grindhouse\" fare.",
