      "description": "AKA \"The worst western ever made\" Chief Yellow Shirt (Ray Danton) is hunting down white men because they broke a treaty. He and all three of his braves find a small squad of U.S. soldiers and take after them. Among the soldiers is a mountain man (Dewitt Lee) who is attacked by a bear (in the funniest scene in the movie) and left for dead. He eventually gains consciousness and starts fighting off the Indians while trying to catch up with the soldiers. Eventually, both sides are killed down to Yellow Shirt and the mountain man, who now race across the desert and try to outsmart each other and survive wind storms, snakes, and hallucinations of their respective women.",
