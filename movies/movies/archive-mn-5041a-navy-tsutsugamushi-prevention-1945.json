      "description": "MN5041a Navy // In this military training film, the nature, effects, and prevention of tsutsugamushi, or scrub typhus, are presented in the milieu of U.S. Marines landing on a Pacific island. The terrain and vegetation in which scrub typhus is commonly found are shown. The life cycle of the typhus-carrying mite is presented in animation. Marines sick with scrub typhus are shown being cared for in a tent hospital. The usual course of the disease is discussed over footage of patients exhibiting the symptoms of the disease. Prevention of the disease by impregnating clothing and bedding with insecticide is discussed and illustrated in detail. Clearing areas of potentially dangerous brush and mites is shown, and the necessity of keeping a clean, well-policed camp is emphasized. Shots include: a pre-attack briefing for bomber crews; aerial footage of a bombing run on a Pacific island; a naval barrage; marines landing on an island and moving inland through tall grass; a makeshift graveyard for American troops; typical eschar of scrub typhus; a field laboratory in a tent.",
