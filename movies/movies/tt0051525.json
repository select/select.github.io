      "description": "A white man and a black man escape from prison. They hate each other, but are chained together and must learn to overcome racial prejudice and mutual contempt. By the end of their adventure, they have almost become friends and have also realized that every sin demands atonement. A gripping, visually powerful, and excellently acted film - perhaps a little overly explicit in its moral intentions.",
