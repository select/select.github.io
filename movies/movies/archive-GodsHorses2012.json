      "description": "Synopsis Yachine is 10 years old, he lives with his family in the slum of Sidi Moumen in Casablanca. His mother, Yemma, leads the family as best as she can. His father suffers from depression, one of his brothers is in the army, another is almost autistic and the third, Hamid, 13, is the boss of the local neighbourhood and Yachineâs protector. When Hamid is sent to jail, Yachine takes up jobs after jobs, though empty, to get free from the doldrums of violence, misery and drugs. Released from prison, Hamid, now an Islamic fundamentalist, persuades Yachine and his pals to join their \"brothers\". The Imam, Abou Zoubeir, their spiritual leader, starts to direct their long-standing physical and mental preparation. One day, he tells them they have been chosen to become martyrs. The film is inspired by the terrorist attacks of May 16th 2003 in Casablanca. international title: God's Horses original title: Les Chevaux de Dieu country: Morocco, France, Belgium sales agent: Stone Angels year: 2012 genre: fiction directed by: Nabil Ayouch film run: 115' release date: BE 13/02/2013, FR 20/02/2013 screenplay: Jamal Belmahi cast: Abdelhakim Rachid, Abdelilah Rachid, Hamza Souidek, Ahmed El Idrissi El Amrani cinematography by: Hichame Alaouie film editing: Damien Keyeux art director: Hafid Amly music: Malvina Meinier production: Les Films du Nouveau Monde, Stone Angels, Y.C.
