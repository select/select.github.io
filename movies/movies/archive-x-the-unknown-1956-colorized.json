      "description": "Army radiation experiments awaken a subterranean monster that feeds on energy and proceeds to terrorize a remote Scottish village. Hammer Films orignally planned it as a sequel to The Quatermass Xperiment, but were unable to get permission from Quatermass creator Nigel Kneale for another writer to use his character. Written by Jimmy Sangster. Starring Dean Jagger, Edward Chapman, Leo McKern, Anthony Newley I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
