      "description": "The Three Stooges - I'll Never Heil Again (1941) IN COLOR! The boys become accidental diplomats in a totally fictional European country ruled by a completely unrecognized dictator. Their wild slapstick, mistaken identities, and outrageous schemes cause chaos at every turn, parodying the rise of totalitarianism during the era with the Stooges’ signature humor. A sequel of sorts to \"You Nazty Spy!\" from a year earlier. Colorized and digitally enhanced as God intended.",
