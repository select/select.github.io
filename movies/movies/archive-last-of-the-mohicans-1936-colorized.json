      "description": "During the brutal French and Indian War, the famed scout Hawkeye (Randolph Scott) agrees to provide safe escort for an army commander's two daughters (Binnie Barnes & Heather Angel) and an army major (Henry Wilcoxon). Based on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper. Directed by George B. Seitz Randolph Scott as Hawkeye Binnie Barnes as Alice Munro Henry Wilcoxon as Major Duncan Heyward Bruce Cabot as Magua Heather Angel as Cora Munro Phillip Reed as Uncas Robert Barrat as Chingachgook I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
