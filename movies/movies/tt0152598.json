    "Plot": "On a cloud, the storks that deliver babies also manufacture them with a machine. We see it stamp out several. The noon whistle sounds in the dispatch room, and only clerk Krazy is still on duty when a rush job is ordered. So, logically or not, Krazy just takes the bundle and flies out. Apparently he can fly, though he did need a plane to get to work. The baby is an Oopie-like brat, and Krazy is pushed down the expectant home's chimney. The people all take him to be their new child, and put him in the cradle. Krazy's disgusted by all of it except that Kitty's one of the family, but that's wrecked when the real kid bursts in.",
