    "Plot": "An electric train (streetcar?) heads down a street in Bedford in England in 1902. It gives us a glorious three minutes of life on the street as people move toward the train, walk along side it, ride their bicycles, move their carts out of the way, stare, and so on. There are school children, old men, young business people, fancy women (one has a waist that must be about twenty inches), and other sights. How wonderful that this was shared with the world.",
