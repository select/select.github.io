      "description": "On exiting a strange cone a young girl deploys her butterfly wings. Mr Méliès is preparing for the show. In a puff of smoke, a star in the centre of which a second young girl appears, occupies the centre of the stage. As quick as lightning and the young girl from the star is transformed into a threatening spider-woman. But Méliès is there! With a magical gunshot the sprawling creature disappears in an enormous cloud of smoke. His mastery of special effects through spectacular staging allowed Méliès to transfer this magic filmed in 1909 onto the big screen. Director: Georges Méliès Nationality: French Actor: Georges Méliès Length: 1' 58\" Also Known As (AKA) A csodálatos pillangó Hungary The Spider and the Butterfly (UK)",
