      "description": "Director's view I learned anything from this project, was that you should not make a film for any reason other than the fact that you love the subject matter. My involvement with this project came when a friend of mine, the late Manoochehr Mahjoobi, called me and said that they have run into trouble with the producer of the film which was based on the characters of a TV series that Mahjoobi and some of his friends had created. Since just few days before this phone call, thecensor board had banned the first draft of the script of PRINCE EHTEJAB, I decided to look into it and eventually ended up finishing the project, which got a dear friend out of jam. The story takes a rooming house as a model for the whole country where in each room there was a tenant from lower class of people and how their lives was made into a constant misery, by the landlady,Ghamar Khanoom who also lived in the house. The film was politically correct, but everything else in it was incorrect as far as I am concerned. (B. Farmanara) Actors: Parvin Malakouti, Mohsen Harandi, Zari Pourzand, Diana, M.Q. Safapour, Golchin, Mehdi Rahmani, Parvin Soleymani, F.L Houshmand, Bani Ahmad, Shideh",
