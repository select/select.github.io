      "description": "A new chief of a \"Culture House\" is planning to hold a terribly boring New Year concert. A group of young amateur actors are doing their best to liven up the concert.\n\nObviously, no one wants to change the program with only a few hours before the show, much less to replace it with something so boring. So everyone teams up in order to prevent Ogurtsov from getting to the stage. They manage to trap Ogurtsov by any means necessary so that the acts can perform their scheduled pieces, and celebrate New Year's Eve as originally planned.\n\nYear of production: 1956\n\nDirected by: Eldar Ryazanov\nWritten by: Boris Laskin, Vladimir Polyakov\nDirector of photography: Arkady Koltsaty\nMusic: Anatols Liepiņš (Anatoly Lepin)\nMusic orchestration: Eddie Rosner, also jazz band leader \nProduction designer: Oleg Grosse\nStarring: Lyudmila Gurchenko, Igor Ilyinsky, Yuri Belov\n\n#new_year_comedy #soviet_film #musical #FullMoviesWithEngSubs",
