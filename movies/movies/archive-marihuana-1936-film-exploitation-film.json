      "description": "Teenager Burma (Harley Wood) and her boyfriend, Dick (Hugh McArthur), meet some friends on a beach. But one of their pals brings something that will ruin the lives of all the attendees: marijuana. Clothes are shed, minds are melted and a stoned girl drowns. After helping drug dealer Tony (Paul Ellis ) cover up the death, Burma and Dick occasionally take a break from getting high and laughing maniacally to peddle grass themselves. Prostitution and untimely deaths follow.",
