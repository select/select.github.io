      "description": "Another military themed movie, made during the 2nd World War, so it's a little on the \"gung ho\" side. This is a little different from the other copy that is available, here. The opening title music has been restored and the hiss, pop, crackle has been cleaned from the audio. There are a lot of familiar faces, including Robert Lowery, who would later play Bruce Wayne/Batman in the \"Batman and Robin\" serial (1949).",
