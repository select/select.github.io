      "description": "An aging bachelor escapes his everyday life and visits a number of former friends, testing out their swimming pools. However, this playful experiment with his own past leads to humiliation, disillusionment, and renewed loneliness.... An allegorical film fable that uses the figure of a homeless wanderer to demonstrate the narrow-mindedness of the well-off American middle class. However, the ambitious content and form sometimes result in kitschy pathos and pretentious symbolism.",
