      "description": "“Silent history done right” “The fight for freedom” “Classic battle scenes” “Exceptional but bogged down by a silly romance” (IMDB reviews quotes). NOTE: This complete version joins together what only had been available at IA as two separate video files. D W Griffith’s last silent epic is the story of the founding of America told from the perspective of a fictional family’s experiences during the Revolutionary War. Occasionally slow and ponderous nevertheless this is an eminently  watchable silent spectacular. Viewable video quality. IMDB rating 6.5. Produced and directed by D W Griffith. Released in 1924. Complete print. AKA “Love and Sacrifice” (UK)",
