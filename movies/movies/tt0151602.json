    "Plot": "When Farmer Alfalfa has a toothache, his dentist uses an anesthetic on him. The dream Al has is something out of Georges Melies in this fun black-and-white Terrytoon.1935 showed a clear bifurcation in cartoons from Paul Terry's studio. Half of it seemed to be minor variations on work he had been doing for ten or fifteen years, first at the Van Beuren studio, and then for his own. Each example of this first type was much the same as earlier versions, perhaps with a fuller orchestra or a different lead character. The supporting cast and the gags were largely unchanged.This one is of the second variety. It indicates that, despite the unvarying credits -- co-directors Terry and Frank Moser, writing by Terry, music by Philp Scheib -- there were different people doing the work behind the scenes, with new and wilder stories and more fluid animation. Even Scheib's music is different here, with a lot of wild scat singing.",
