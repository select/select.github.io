However, the film is now perceived as a landmark of artistic cinema with its spectacle of striking visual images. With English intertitles and German subtitles.",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Famously rumored to have been recorded with only gay and lesbian cast members, this film version of the Oscar Wilde play has also often been called one of the first art films from the US. While it was a massive financial failure, ending the producing and directing career of Alla Nazimova, modern and contemporary critical reception has been much more positive.  I've added three distinct soundtracks for the film, with one improvised by \"Aphir\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWzTppQfXIc",
