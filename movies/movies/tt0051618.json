      "description": "“Plot loaded with loose ends” “Hollywood’s worst 'Blob' entry” (IMDB reviews quotes). You are expecting ‘50s drive-in sci-fi, but what you get is a low-budget, mostly set-bound jungle adventure in Mexico with a cast which includes African hyenas, Indonesian fruit bats, Australian birds, a harmless snake on a string (to make it look like a cobra) and a supposedly deadly iguana. It’s no surprise that its okay human cast couldn't save this one. I watched it so you don’t have to. IMDB rating 5.0. Directed by Paul Landres. Released in 1958. Compete print. (tape transfer). AKA “Beyond the Flame Barrier”",
