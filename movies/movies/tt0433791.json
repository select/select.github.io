    "Plot": "The young hero, Frederick, is leaving his country home and going to the city to attend the bull fight, and while there he meets and woos a beautiful maiden, forgetting his own little sweetheart at home. The charming miss strolls with him and he tells her of his undying love and vows to live for her alone. As he leaves her at her home and strolls away her former lover comes along and, seeing them together, remonstrates with the girl, but she coldly tells him that it is all over between them and that she loves another. The next day Frederick meets the girl again and proposes to her and she accepts him, and immediately he takes her to his home to introduce her to his parents, who are a trifle demure in receiving her, knowing his treatment to his former faithful little sweetheart. Everything bids fair for their happiness when the maiden's cast-off lover appears and sends in for Frederick, and upon meeting him presents him with a letter which he had received from her telling him that he was the only man she ever loved. Frederick takes the letter and when he confronts the girl with it she coolly admits her authorship of the missive, and immediately he becomes distracted and denounces her and orders her from the house. She leaves the place and returns to her former sweetheart, while poor Frederick's life is wrecked, for in his heart he loves her with a supernatural love and everywhere he goes he sees her beaming face before him.",
