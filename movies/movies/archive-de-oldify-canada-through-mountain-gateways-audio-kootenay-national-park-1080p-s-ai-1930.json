      "description": "Breathtaking views of mountain gateways through the Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, Canada almost a century ago in 1930. A couple takes a trip by luxury car through this beautiful part of Canada known as the Canadian Rockies, goes horse riding and has a spectacular encounter with a black bear and her two cubs. Today many of the bendy, narrow roads have been replaced by modern highways. Apparently feeding the bears as can be seen in this film nowadays is prohibited by law and could result in a hefty fine. The route starts in Spokane which lies in the USA, just south of the border with Canada. Route: Spokane - Washington - Rockies - Kootenay National Park - Sinclair Valley - Floc Lake - Marble Canyon - Bears - Castle Mountain (home of the little Chinook Wing) - Banff and Cascade Mountain. The film is accompanied by beautiful music by the highly talented Ukrainean cinematic music composer Vadim Krakhmal; Titles: - Dawn Mist. - Frozen stones. - Adventure. - Through the Mist.
