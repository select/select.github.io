    "Plot": "Typical of the Trem Carr-produced Monogram westerns starring Rex Bell, this one opens in the East with Craig Larrigan as a polo-playing playboy who has no use for the West nor the western way of life. Rancher Jess Bailey, accompanied by his daughter Virginia, comes east to get his eastern-business partner John Larrigan to advance him more money to keep their rustler-plagued ranch afloat, and Craig and Virginia strike up a romance, which is going nowhere fast because of his elitist attitude. The contrived motivation to get the Bell character out west makes less sense than usual, and the incidents that follow carry no logic either.",
