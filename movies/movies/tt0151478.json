    "Plot": "This was a Columbia cartoon starring the human boy Scrappy in which the leading character is an assistant to a mad scientist character who creates a robot but despite electrifying him, the robot won't work. As the scientist cries, Scrappy goes inside the robot's body and ends up controlling him. The scientist, not knowing the boy was inside, then enters the robot in a boxing match...As you can discern from my synopsis, there's not too much logic here though the animation is mostly fine and there was some amusements like when the human boxer that's fighting the robot does an uncanny impersonation of Curly of The Three Stooges whose live-action shorts were also made by Columbia. I also liked when Scrappy made the robot say, \"I forfeit.\" So on that note, Man of Tin is worth a look.",
