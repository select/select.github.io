      "description": "“Better than average Hopalong Cassidy film” (IMDB review quote). Hoppy heads to Argentina in this B-western with more plot than shoot-em-up action. However the supporting cast is good and so are the production values. A good lazy afternoon pick for B-oater fans. Filmed at Lone Pine, CA. IMDB rating 7.1. Directed by Nate Watt. Released in 1939.
