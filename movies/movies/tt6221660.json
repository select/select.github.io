    "Plot": "Roger seems to have had enough of the mercenary lifestyle and is now living a life of wine, women, and leisure. However, he and his die-hard team of soldiers-for-hire once again find themselves stalking through the forests of Eastern Europe to hunt what they have been told is a team taking out \"important national interests\". They soon find they have met their match as one by one they are wounded or killed; becoming the hunted instead of the hunters. Roger finally corners the \"team\" hunting them only to find it is just one woman, a very beautiful sniper named Sdanka who is out for vengeance. He soon finds she is more than his equal in the arts of war. Banded together, they now fight against an army of rogue soldiers and renegade agents with no back up. They both soon find that sometimes your enemies are not, and your friends are your enemies.",
