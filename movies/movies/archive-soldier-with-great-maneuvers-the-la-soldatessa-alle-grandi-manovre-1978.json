      "description": "Army Doctor Eva Marini wants to join a regiment to secure equal rights for women. So her commanding officer sends her off to a boot camp led by Renzo Montagnani, where only the most unruly soldiers end up. This is probably the right cast and movie. There were a couple made with basically the same cast and plot. Edwige Fenech joins the army in one and she is a nurse in the other.  Italian with optional English subtitles",
