    "Plot": "Busted from his job waiting drinks at a saloon in the Yukon, Krazy Kat goes across the Street and gets measured for a Mountie Uniform in this cartoon.Manny Gould and Ben Harrison had been producing and directing the Krazy Kat cartoons since the middle of the 1920s and by this time they bore no relation to George Herriman's now-classic cartoon strip that ran in all the Hearst papers -- the story is that no one liked the strip except for William Randolph Hearst. By this time, Krazy was a generic cartoon lead, with enough name recognition and a good production team, capable of pacing the jokes, to fill in the schedule of releases that Charles Mintz did for Columbia. They would continue through Mintz' death, when COlumbia's cartoon production would go through several patchy years.",
