      "description": "It's Friday @PizzaFLIX \nStars: William Powell, Fay Wray, Helen Kane, Eugene Pallette\nDirector: A. Edward Sutherland\nStory by: Charles Brackett \n\nBefore Sunset Boulevard... The Lost Weekend… and Titanic... 3x Oscar-winner Charles Brackett penned this rare pre-Code musical for Paramount Pictures!\n \nA rare surviving gem of transitional Hollywood, \"Pointed Heels\" captures the industry in flux as it embraced synchronized sound. Directed by A. Edward Sutherland, this early musical drama blends backstage intrigue with the experimental energy of the talkie revolution.\n\nThe film features a standout performance by William Powell, whose signature charm and sophistication were already taking shape before his rise to 1930s stardom in The Thin Man series. Fay Wray, on the brink of iconic status in King Kong (1933), brings both glamour and depth to her role. But perhaps most historically notable is Helen Kane—the original “boop-oop-a-doop” girl—whose animated persona inspired Betty Boop and helped define the Jazz Age in both music and film.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?
