Unable to fathom the reason behind their unwise decision, the all-powerful deity sends his amphibian followers something unexpected. However, utterly disappointed with their sovereign, the frogs ask Jupiter for yet another king, this time, someone much more to their liking. As a result, Jupiter, who is growing tired of their complaints, sends the frogs an elegant crane complete with a shiny crown. Then, chaos ensued.",
