      "description": "The Nomad - A group of scientists and researchers make a shocking discovery that could disrupt our entire society. One of the researchers can't handle the thought of this and sets out on a violent and religious death crusade, looking to find truth in his actions. Meanwhile, a journalist is covering the story and finds herself strangely connected to the researcher. She enters into a moral dilemma: stop the researcher before more people die, or try to connect with him and ask him to do her one favor that will change her life.\n2023.
