She announces \"My hero!\" and take him inside her mansion, where he struggles with a grapefruit until the butler throws him out.This cartoon raises several questions: what's the name of he squeaky little dog that shows up in the Krazy Kat cartoons about this time? Why are the cartoons of Leopold Stokowski indistinguishable from cartoon lions? And, probably least importantly, what is going on in this cartoon?",
