      "description": "Great enhanced and colorized film footage about Steam Pumping Stations in The Netherlands nearly a century ago. These pumping stations were in fact the successors to water windmills. Their only purpose was / is to drain the water from the Dutch polders into canals to keep the ground, that often lies below sea level, dry. This film shows three important Steam Pumping Stations, i.e. the \"Cruquius\", the \"Arkselsedam\" and the \"Linge gemaal\". The Cruquius was built in 1849 and lies in the Haarlemmermeer polder. In 1933 it was converted into a museum which still exists to this day! The Arkelsedam lies near the town of Gorinchem and was used to pump the Zederik-boezem of the Vijherenlanden. Unfortunately it was demolished; some parts can still be seen in the  Cruquius-museum. The Linge-gemaal, designed my Mr. Dr. G. Kolff, was built during WWII and opened in 1945 by former Queen Wilhelmina. Its purpose was to pump the Beneden-Merwede near the town of Hardinxveld-Giessendam.  Source B&W footage: Beeld en Geluid. The music is by the great contemporary composer Trevor Kowalski.",
