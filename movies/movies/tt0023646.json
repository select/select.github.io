When Max tells Pat, it breaks her heart and she runs off. She follows his career through the newspaper. Later, she meets Eddie, a gangster running gumball machines, when he helps her out of a bathroom where the door is stuck. After taking her on a date, he confesses he'd like to marry her because of how pure, good, and clean she is, which fills her with guilt and doubt. Unsure whether to say yes, Pat asks for a day to decide. When Max comes back into her life hoping to rekindle what they had even though he's married, she must decide which relationship to move forward with.",
