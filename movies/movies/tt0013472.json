      "description": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230205145256/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Gang February 21 - I'm currently in the process of converting this collection to a better (Matroska) container format and also amplifying the audio tracks which need it, so if there are episodes you have difficulty hearing, be patient, I'll probably be finished in about a month and will then swap out the files here. This is not a complete set; it includes a series of episodes going up to 1938 and doesn't include later characters such as \"Froggy\" and \"Mickey\". I'm not an Our Gang aficionado, so I'm not sure what's missing, but maybe someone else can create another page and fill in the gaps. Hopefully, the episodes of this collection should keep most viewers happy until a full collection finds its way to IA. **FAIR USE NOTICE** This content may contain Copyrighted (©) Material.
