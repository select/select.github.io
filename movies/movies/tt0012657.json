      "description": "1921 Silent film starring and produced by Hobart Bosworth. This film was directed by Rowland V Lee and tells the story of a bitter sea captain angry with the world because his wife left him. The film also stars Emory Johnson and Bessie Love. Copied from 8mm so it is very grainy and murky. Here on the Internet Archive you can also see Hobart Bosworth, an all but forgotten cinema pioneer, as The Scarecrow in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and as Mr Harrington in the uncut version of \"The Phantom Express\" (which was written, produced and directed by his \"The Sea Lion\" co-star Emory Johnson.)
