    "Plot": "When a fox has to evade a hunting pack of dogs and bring home food to her kits, she finds she must contend with Puddy Pup -- or perhaps it's the other way around in this delightful Terrytoon.Everyone on Paul Terry's staff seems to have been in a good mood when working on this cartoon and there is a particularly delightful score by Philip Scheib for this one. Puddy's character had been varying since his latest design a couple of years earlier, as competitor to Disney's Pluto Pup, but this is a very attractive outing for him He exhibits his now usual mixture of canine and human attributes and the gag construction is top-notch and fast paced.",
