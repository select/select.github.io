      "description": "During the Civil War, a proper young woman from the East (Joan Leslie) arrives to join her brother (Reed Hadley) in a city on the Missouri-Arkansas border, where both the Confederacy and the Union would like to gain control of the local lead mines. She does her best to fit in after discovering that he runs a saloon, and falls in love with a mine foreman (John Lund). But the town elders' attempt to maintain their neutrality in the war is disrupted by the arrival of Quantrill's Raiders, led by a former confederate soldier gone rogue (Brian Donlevy) and including the James brothers, the Younger brothers, and the fiery Kate Quantrill, a former resident of the town. John Lund as Lance Horton Brian Donlevy as Charles Quantrill Audrey Totter as Kate Quantrill Joan Leslie as Sally Maris Ben Cooper as Jesse James Nina Varela as Mayor Delilah Courtney Jim Davis as Cole Younger Reed Hadley as Bitterroot Bill Maris Ann Savage as Glenda Virginia Christine as Jenny Ellen Corby as First Townswoman Minerva Urecal as Mrs. Stuart James Brown as Frank James I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
