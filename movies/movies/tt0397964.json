    "Plot": "Lots of story lines abound in this low budget drama/thriller from promising young filmmaker, Chris Allen. Some of the acting is top notch while some performances were fairly inconsistent &amp; weak. Allen is a talented writer with a bright future and he incorporated some really interesting &amp; effective camera work in his quadruple duties of writer/director/cinematographer/producer. For me, standout performances were delivered from, in no particular order, Bob Berry, Bobby Christman, and Jason Kistler, among many others. Berry was one hundred percent authentic as the fatherly figure, and Christman was downright creepy and explosive in his sinister portrayal, while Kistler was very effective as the lonely vigilante. Overall, the film was a little slow &amp; confusing at times, but it had some very, very enjoyable moments. Packed with an original score on a shoestring budget, the one thing the film needed most was better casting amongst some of its female characters, and, perhaps, better sound quality in spots. Still, plenty o' promise resides in Allen, the seasoned Berry, Christman, Kistler, Erin Clarich, Dave Briggs, and many, many others. A huge undertaking on a very small budget.",
