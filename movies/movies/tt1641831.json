      "description": "Doomsday Prophecy - When a sudden rash of worldwide geological disturbances threatens the planet, a desperate search begins for a vanished author who is believed to hold the key to predicting future disasters. But the author is soon discovered dead and in his possession is an ancient Divining Rod - a device that bestows visions of the future upon those who hold it. As the Divining Rod paints a bleak vision for Earth’s future, it’s a race against time to find the whereabouts of ancient devices that can counteract the devastating geological disturbances that are literally splitting the planet apart.\n2011.

When the proof reader arrives, he finds the book editor dead and upon touching the artifact, has visions himself about the ending of the world. The entire plot is based on the 2012 galactic allignment end of world scenario, and the lead character teams up with an attractive archeologist and together they run from rogue government agents who also want the artifact, whilst narrowly avoiding death both from being shot and by falling into the earth during massive earthquakes. Mean while the rest of the world is befalling massive destruction. with only hours to spare, the duo must somehow save the day.",
