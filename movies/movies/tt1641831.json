But the author is soon discovered dead and in his possession is an ancient Divining Rod - a device that bestows visions of the future upon those who hold it. As the Divining Rod paints a bleak vision for Earth’s future, it’s a race against time to find the whereabouts of ancient devices that can counteract the devastating geological disturbances that are literally splitting the planet apart.\n2011.
