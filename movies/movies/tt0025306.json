Mrs. Higginbottom is opposed but the four Higginbottom children approve, on the premise that if Pa makes some easy money, they can continue to loaf. Grandpa, a kindly but meddling old soul also arrives for a visit. Money begins to roll in but not as fast as the children spend it. And then the investment turns out to be a pyramid scheme, and the family is stone-cold broke.",
