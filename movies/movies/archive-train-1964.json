But he French Resistance is determined to stop the train without damaging the cargo, and the station master devises an elaborate ruse to divert the train so that it never leaves French territory. directed by John Frankenheimer Burt Lancaster as Paul Labiche Paul Scofield as Colonel Franz Von Waldheim Jeanne Moreau as Christine Suzanne Flon as Mademoiselle Villard Michel Simon as Papa Boule Wolfgang Preiss as Major Herren Albert Rémy as Didont Charles Millot as Pesquet I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
