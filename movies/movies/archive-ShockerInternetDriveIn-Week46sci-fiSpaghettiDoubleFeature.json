      "description": "Hello and welcome back to your favorite scientifically advanced Shocker Internet Drive In! With Spring about to spring, we thought we would things up with some Italian science fiction guaranteed to make you yearn for the good old days of \"Star Wars\" (or even \"Starcrash\"). After some wonderful coming attractions and a Road Runner cartoon, we gladly bring you \"Cosmos: War of the Planets\", an epic of confusion with something to do with an alien threat to Earth. Then, after a brief intermission, we happily present \"War of the Robots\", another epic of confusion with something to do with an alien threat to Earth! So, while we make the meatballs and boil up the noodles, come on down to our little slice of internet fun, park the car in your favorite spot and get ready for the best \"Sci-Fi Spaghetti\" you will ever find (for free)! http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://www.shockerredirect.tk/",
