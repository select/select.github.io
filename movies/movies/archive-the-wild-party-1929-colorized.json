      "description": "This movie became Public Domain on 1 January 2025. Clara Bow's first Talkie movie, in which she plays a party-loving college student who falls for her professor (Fredric March). It was also the first use of a 'boom mic', created by the movie's director Dorothy Arzner by placing a mic on the end of a fishing pole. IMDB page: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020590/reference/ Colorized using DeOldify and AVISynth. (Note: Although the movie is public domain, the colorization is copyright by me.
