      "description": "The Devil's Cavaliers is the story of Captain Richard Stiller, a war weary man who may be a rogue, a rake, or an honorable hero (even at the end of the story, his personality is still a bit ambiguous), his seemingly doomed love affair with Countess Louise (though it is not entirely clear whether this is a matter of class, ethnic/national prejudice or simply bad attitudes), and his numerous sword-fights. He also has a number of amusing cronies whose main task seems to be comic relief (which will be greatly appreciated by confused and bored viewers), and there are some intrigues and subplots among his opponents (though the elaborate nature of these is never fully justified by the intended ends, and these plot devices end up looking remarkably silly).",
