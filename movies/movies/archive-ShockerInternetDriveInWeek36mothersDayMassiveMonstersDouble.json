      "description": "With a roar and a blast of fire breath, we are pleased to welcome you to the Shocker Internet Drive In and our special Motherâs Day film fest. Not only do all Moms get in free this week, but we feel there is no better way than to celebrate everyoneâs favorite person than with a bunch of giant monsters stomping on Korea and Japan. After a few \"giant\" coming attractions and a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we bring you Korea's answer to Godzilla \"Yongary, Monster From The Deep\". Then, following a brief intermission featuring a \"feminine\" touch, our second movie is \"Monster From A Prehistoric Planet\" (also known as \"Gappa\") featuring a very upset mother (and father) tearing Japan apart looking for her baby. Fun for the whole family is guaranteed, but Dads, if you were smart, you would send the kids off to Grandma's house and bring Mom down to the big screen for some snack bar cuisine and backseat \"massive\" monster hunting of your own!
