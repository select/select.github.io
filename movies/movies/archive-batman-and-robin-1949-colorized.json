      "description": "In this sequel to the original Batman serial, Commissioner Gordon (Lyle Talbot) requests help from the caped crusaders (Robert Lowery & Johnny Duncan) to find a professor (William Fawcett)'s motor vehicle control device, which has been stolen by The Wizard, a black-hooded mastermind. They must also rescue trouble-prone magazine photographer Vicki Vale (Jane Adams). 15-chapter cliffhanger serial I've colorized this using AI software. It doesn't always get the colors right, but except for Robin's outfit coming out dark and colorless, I think it looks pretty natural.",
