      "description": "This print isn't perfect, however it is a noticable improvement over the existing IA copy, plus it is un-cropped and in the correct aspect ratio which the IA print isn't. A mysterious strangler is at work behind the scenes in Gypsy Rose Lee's popular mystery novel, \"The G-String Murders,\" brought to the screen as a lively backstage whodunit starring Barbara Stanwyck backed by a worthy supporting cast and burlesque acts to spice up the rising body count. Directed by William A Wellman. Released in 1943. a.k.a. \"The G-String Murders\" Complete print. NOTE: If you use a media player with image controls, such as GOM, increase the contrast and brightness just a bit. This will considerably improve this print's eye appeal.",
