    "Plot": "Frank (Ray Winstone) is confined to a residential home, stricken with Alzheimer's - past, present and future steadily disintegrating. Then one day, James (Jim Sturgess) appears, wanting to re-connect with a father who no longer knows him. James springs Frank from the home and the pair go on the run. As their haphazard journey unfolds - funny, violent and tragic by turns - the present merges with imperfect memories of the past and fact with fiction and we begin to realize that nothing is quite what it seems. ASHES itself defies neat categorization; part road movie, part psychological thriller; part contemporary film noir, but all beautifully shot and with a grimly satisfying twist.",
