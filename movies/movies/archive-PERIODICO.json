      "description": "Fidel Castro As on a journey to Cuba by a speech from Fidel Castro before his Parliament that was transmitted in television a film was made. (original epic sound) A severe hurricane, which devastated parts of the island the day before, just decays . I turn on the TV in my hotel room and without understanding Spanish I hold my video camera on the screen: Fidel Castro before his parliament, hanging on the lips. He is in the middle of one of his great speeches which will take 50 minutes. I ask for a pillow because my arm is paralyzed, my neck becomes stiff, the eyepiece is sweating, but I do not stop filmimg. While the sound continues unedited, the picture from time to time is interrupted with tourist photographs and television images of the disaster. (LUTZ MOMMARTZ)",
