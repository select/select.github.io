      "description": "Interesting, software-enhanced, motion-stabilized, restored and AI colorized film about Stockholm (Sweden) in 1936. The speed of the film has been delayed by 30% to obtain the correct speed. Because of this, the audio has also been stretched and thus occasionally sounds a bit slurred. Stockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden as well as its capital. The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea. Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the county seat of Stockholm County [Wiki]. In 1936, the year of this film, an international Expo was held in Stockholm. In that year it had about half a million inhabitants. Nowadays that number has risen to 1.8 million in the urban areas.",
