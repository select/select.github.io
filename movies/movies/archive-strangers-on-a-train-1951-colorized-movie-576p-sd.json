It was shot in late 1950, and released by  Warner Bros.  on June 30, 1951, starring  Farley Granger ,  Ruth Roman  and  Robert Walker . The story concerns two strangers who meet on a train, one of whom is a  psychopath  who suggests that they \"exchange\" murders so that neither will be caught. The film initially received mixed reviews, but has since been regarded much more favorably. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",
