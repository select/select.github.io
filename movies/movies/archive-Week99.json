      "description": "Hello and welcome back to everyone's favorite possessed picture palace. With the demon days of summer in full swing, what better way to beat the evening heat than in a haunted bed with a few good scary stories. First up, after the usual coming attractions and visit with Bugs Bunny, we present 1977's \"Death Bed\", a true wonder about a possessed bed that likes to eat people. Then, following a brief intermission, we finish up with 1978's \"House of the Dead\", a rather well done low budget anthology dealing with murder, ghosts and morality as told by a mortician to an adulterer. So the moral of this story is simple - don't piss the bed off when you change the sheets and don't forget to visit the snack bar.
