However the arrival of a wounded Spitfire pilot (John Mills) and a mysterious bald gentleman (Alastair Sim) means the boy must stay in the Barrington's house. At the house Mr Barrington (Leslie Banks) and his assistant (Michael Wilding) are working on a top-secret new bombsight to help the war effort. Ronald begins to notice strange behaviour in the village and gradually uncovers a plot to steal the bomb sight when it is developed.",
