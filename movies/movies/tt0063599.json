      "description": "An archbishop released from Soviet captivity is elected pope and, through an exemplary renunciation of material goods, seeks to prevent a new world war.   A magnificent film adaptation of the bestseller, technically very sophisticated, while respectful in its treatment of the issues raised and its portrayal of the church, it is emotionally charged and lacks nuance. The Pope's personality comes across as convincing and believable thanks to Anthony Quinn's strong performance.",

He is brought to Rome by Father David Telemond, a troubled young priest who befriends him. Once at the Vatican, he is immediately given an audience with the Pope, who elevates him to Cardinal Priest. The world is on the brink of war due to a Chinese-Soviet feud made worse by a famine caused by trade restrictions brought against China by the U.S. When the Pontiff suddenly dies, Lakota's genuine character and unique life experience move the College of Cardinals to elect him as the new Pope. But Pope Kiril I must now deal with his own self-doubt, the struggle of his friend Father Telemond, who is under scrutiny for his beliefs, and find a solution to the crisis in China.",
