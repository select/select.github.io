      "description": "This is one penguin's story of life and death set against the backdrop of one of the harshest coastlines in the world, the Skeleton Coast of South Western Africa. From the moment she's born, Lucy's life is a constant struggle. Her parents must brave a band of seals that terrorize the penguins every time they enter the sea while the beach is threatened by scavenging gulls and jackals.",
