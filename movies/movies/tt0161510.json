    "Plot": "Nancy and Sluggo, along with their friends, use various schemes to raise money for the USO. They release mice into a house, then Nancy sells the owner a cat; a vase Nancy can't sell turns out to have $60 inside when she smashes it out of frustration; the boys rig a fan at a knothole in a fence to blow hats and toupees off passers-by, then run away when one of their victims is a cop. Finally, they stage a carnival (one popular booth is breaking plates \"made in Japan\" with baseballs).",
