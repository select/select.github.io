      "description": "Toshiro Mifune is unforgettable as Kingo Gondo, a wealthy industrialist whose family becomes the target of a cold-blooded kidnapper in  High and Low  ( Tengoku to jigoku ), the highly influential domestic drama and police procedural from director Akira Kurosawa. Adapting Ed McBain's detective novel  King's Ransom, Kurosawa moves effortlessly from compelling race-against-time thriller to exacting social commentary, creating a diabolical treatise on contemporary Japanese society.",
