    "Plot": "In the distant future of 1999, when the world is Utopian and everyone flies, from dogs to dentures and houses, Krazy Kat gets into a space ship and flies to Mars.This cartoon from Harrison and Gould, who had been producing the movie cartoons for a dozen years at this point, is a burlesque of The March of Time. That was, for a decade and a half, the leading newsreel. It was produced by Time-Life and was conceived of as loss-leading advertising for Time Magazine. Usually it followed the standard newsreel formula of several subjects, separated by the exhortation \"Time Marches On!\" Occasionally it would cover a single subject, like the well-remembered \"Inside Nazi Germany\".In any case, this is a typically funny Krazy Kat cartoon, filled with a goodly number of well-timed gags. It bears no relation to the famous comic strip by George Herriman, nor had it for more than a decade.",
