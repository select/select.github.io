The ‘52 revue opened at Broadway’s Royale Theatre with Robert Clary, Alice Ghostley, Paul Lynde, and of course Eartha Kitt. Comedy by sketches by Mel Brooks, and musical direction courtesy of Anton Coppola, uncle of Frances. It ran for 365 performances through March of 1953.\n\nRetitled simply \"New Faces,\" a version of the ’52 Broadway revue was filmed in Hollywood on Cinemascope for Twentieth Century Fox. Most of the original cast returned, with the song order expanded to include Kitt's slinky Christmas hit.  A typical movie musical plot was tossed in, but make no mistake you are watching this for EARTHA KITT in her big-screen debut… prepare to be WOWED!",

      "description": "The plot involved a producer and performer (Ronny Graham) in financial trouble and is trying to stave off an angry creditor long enough to open his show. A wealthy Texan offers to help out, on the condition that his daughter be in the show. New Faces was a musical revue with songs and comedy skits tied together by a quirky plot. It ran on Broadway for nearly a year in 1952 and was then made into a motion picture in 1954. It helped jump start the careers of several young performers including Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Eartha Kitt, Carol Lawrence, performer/writer Mel Brooks (as Melvin Brooks), and lyricist Sheldon Harnick.\n\nDirectors: Harry Horner, John Beal\nWriters: Ronny Graham, Mel Brooks\nStars: Ronny Graham, Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary \nGenres: Classics, Comedy, Musical\n\n@CCC socials:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CultCinemaClassics \nhttps://www.instagram.com/cultcinemaclassics\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/cultcinemaclassics",

      "description": "A filmed performance (in CinemaScope) of the highly popular Broadway hit that was basically a collection of skits, sketches, songs and dances built around a flimsy plot to meld them all together which, for the most part, worked. The plot involves a performer/producer (Ronny Graham)who finds himself in financial difficulties on the eve of opening night because a big check is needed before the curtain can go up. But a wealthy Texan says he will put up the money, if his daughter is in the show and he can see it first. End of plot, but the beginning of the careers of some young and talented people who have had careers across many decades. Ertha Kitt sings four songs, including \"C'est Si Bon\" and \"Santa Baby\" in and around some funny skits; \"Trip of the Month\", \"Snake Charmer\", \"Crazy Man\" and \"Oedipus Goes South.\" Graham and Mel Brooks (in his Melvin Brooks days)are credited with most of the sketch material and just the title of the \"Oedipus\" bit suggests Brooks. There is a burlesque of \"Death of a Salesman\", which was probably the easiest to write of all. It also appears that when Brooks later did \"The Producers\", he hadn't forgotten everything about \"New Faces.\" Written by Les Adams",
