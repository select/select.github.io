The Rascals go to talk to the owner of the property and discover that he is a big kid himself. After listening to them, he walks out of a board meeting to help them set up their amusement park. His disgruntled board of directors follows with plans to vote him out of position, but they actually get drafted in helping run the park. In the end, the owner and board president offers to let them keep the company in order that he can stay young at heart. http://ourgang.wikia.com/wiki/Boys_Will_Be_Joys",
