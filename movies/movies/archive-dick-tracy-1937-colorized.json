      "description": "Adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip in which a master criminal known as The Spider has the mind of the famous detective's brother altered so as to turn him against Dick. 15-chapter cliffhanger serial Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy Kay Hughes as Gwen Andrews Smiley Burnette as Mike McGurk Lee Van Atta as Junior John Picorri as Moloch Carleton Young as Gordon Tracy Fred Hamilton as Steve Lockwood Francis X. Bushman as Chief Clive Anderson I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
