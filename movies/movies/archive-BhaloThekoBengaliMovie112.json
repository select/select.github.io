      "description": "Synopsis The film is set in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose's home in Falta, masquerading as Uttarpara. It deals with the story of a girl Anindi and her family (including uncle, brother, parents and sister), lover (brother's friend Babua) and few neighbours. Nature, tradition and love are Anandi's pillars of support in difficult times. Her brother will slowly drift away with bad or risky companies and will not return home one day and will be lost for ever. Her parents will die heartbroken and her sister will get married suddenly and will leave the family. Babua will go abroad and marry somebody else. It is implied that Anandi is forgetful of her sorrows that she was deceived by Babua (Joy Sengupta) she loved most. Babua comes back from abroad only to say: 'Anandi, I came back to set you free.'. The film has a non-linear pace with frequent jumps between current time and past. Film critics described Anandi as a large canvas painted in several hues. She stands against rootless internalisation and perplexed culture. A poem by one of the renowned Bangladeshi author and scholar \"Humayun Azad\" named \"shuvescha\" was recited in the ending part of the film by Anandi while wandering lonly in their garden. .[ Cast: Soumitra Chatterjee, Joy Sengupta, Debshankar Halder and Vidya Balan   About this movie Title: Bhalo Theko - Take Care (2003) Directed by: Goutam Halder Music: Prabuddha Banerjee Year: 2003 Country: India Language: Bengali Color: Color Runtime: 109 min.
