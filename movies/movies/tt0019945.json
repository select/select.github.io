      "description": "It's Friday @PizzaFLIX \nStars: Dorothy Mackaill, Ian Keith, Myrna Loy\nDirector: Reginald Barker\n🍕Myrna Loy Before The Thin Man🍕\nLong before she became the sophisticated Nora Charles, Myrna Loy burned up the screen in provocative roles that pushed the boundaries of the era. Directed by Reginald Barker, this forgotten frontier sizzler delivers melodrama, romance, and adventure straight from the early days of talkies.\n\nDorothy Mackaill shines as Ruth Jordan, a hard-drinking city girl thrust into the rugged world of the American West. Ian Keith, a leading man of the silent era, plays Steven Ghent — a cowboy with a mission to reform her. But it’s Myrna Loy, as the jealous and sultry Manuella, who steals every scene with a pre-Code performance that’s anything but ladylike.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?
