      "description": "Exclusive FRIDAY at PizzaFLIX Edition!\nStars: Jacqueline Bisset, James Brolin, & Claire Trevor\nScreenplay: Samuel Fuller, Harold Medford\nDirected by: Robert D. Webb\nIn their first leading roles, STUNNING Jacqueline Bisset and a SMOOTH James Brolin shine in this cold-war spy thriller. The filmmakers didn’t pickpocket the plot from Samuel Fuller. It’s a remake of his late-period noir PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET. Locations moved from the gritty streets of New York City to the segregated ones of Cape Town and serve as a grim reminder of South Africa’s Apartheid.",
