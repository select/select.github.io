      "description": "“The first masala movie” (IMDB review quote). A rogue with a heart of gold; forbidden loves; a family pining for a long-lost son; a crippled dancer in need of an operation and it all comes right in a finale that leaves everyone deliriously happy. Yep it’s bollywood ‘40s style. The songs are sad and sentimental. The dance, what there is of it, traditional and conservative. There is only one limited-budget production number. The first Hindi movie with an antihero. IMDB rating 7.5. Directed by Gyan Mukhejee. Released in 1943 (India only). Complete print. Hindi language with English subtitles.",
