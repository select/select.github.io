      "description": "In this film I will take you back in time to London during WWII to show you what this great city really was like back then. This video is made as seen through the eyes of my parents who lived in London during the war. They met each other in 1943 and got maried in the summer of 1945. My father was stationed in London as member of the Dutch Navy and my mother, who was born in London, worked for a large London warehouse . She lived through the entire 5 year war period, including the Blitz that lasted over 8 months as well as the V1 and V2 attacks period.",
