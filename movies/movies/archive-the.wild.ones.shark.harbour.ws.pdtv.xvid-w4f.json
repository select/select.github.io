      "description": "Shark Harbour follows a specialist 'Shark Research Team' - commissioned by the NSW government in response to the surge in attacks - as they conduct the most comprehensive and technologically advanced study of sharks that's ever been undertaken in Australia. Led by marine biologists and shark experts, Dr Amy Smoothey and Professor Vic Peddemors, they want to know if - in a city of nearly four and a half million people, surrounded by much loved and used waterways - sharks and humans can safely co-exist.",
