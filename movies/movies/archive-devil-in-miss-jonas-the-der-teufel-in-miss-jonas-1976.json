      "description": "Not quite a remake of 1973's Devil in Miss Jones but borrows some of the plot and adds a little Heaven can Wait.  Poor Miss Jonas (Christa Free) is accidentally killed three days before her time and the devil allows her to go back to Earth to live out those three days.  Quite good resolution with German and French soundtracks and optional English subtitles.",
