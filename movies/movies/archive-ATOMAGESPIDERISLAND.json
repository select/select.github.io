      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with poster art from one of the movies overlayed with drive-in style audio. Burning the DVD is easy: Download the zipped folder. Copy the VIDEO_TS FOLDER. Grab a blank DVD and burn the VIDEO TS folder onto it, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD features a double-bill of ATOM AGE VAMPIRE & HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND, along with the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show.",
