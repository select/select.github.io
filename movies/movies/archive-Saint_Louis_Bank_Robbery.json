      "description": "Steve McQueen stars in a gritty, downbeat, and sometimes savage heist movie that features a gang of very psychologically warped men and a story that's based on an actual crime. Warning: this film is devoid of humor, wit, cheerfulness, glamor, and mercy. It's grim to the brim. Some will find that viewing it is an unpleasant experience. This movie is in the public domain. Video-Cellar wrote: The film was originally published without a notice, but most prints currently in circulation are later television syndication prints which had a super'd copyright notice on the end. The renewal would be effectively invalid on that basis alone, but when you add the renewing party \"Film World International\" was one of those companies that tried to renew films they didn't really own before they entered the PD, it is completely invalid. They also tried this with \"The Proud Rebel\", \"The Deep Six\" and \"Lonelyhearts\". Only problem was that Alan Ladd Enterprises (Deep Six) and Schary Productions (Lonelyhearts) also applied for renewals and FWI got found out. Don't ask me why the copyright office keeps the records of the fraudulent claims on file.",
