      "description": "He Ran All the Way is a 1951 American FILM NOlR crime drama directed by John Berry, starring John Garfield and Shelley Winters.   Though John Garfield denied any communist party affiliation, he found himself blacklisted by major studio bosses. Perhaps the stress associated with pressure from the House Un-American Activities Committee contributed to the death of the long-term liberal, who died from heart complications May 21st, 1952 at the sadly premature age of 39. He Ran All The Way proved to be his last film.   You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and read an article from FILM NOlR of the Week .",
