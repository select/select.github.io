David (Ansbach) has returned to his small town to try and sort through the decisions he needs to make in order to move on to the next stage of his life. Meanwhile, Amanda (Kalomiris) who stayed in their small town, has also been unable to move forward for entirely different reasons. Feeling trapped under the weight of her parents' grief, she also can't escape the stigma that ties her to the tragedy that turned their small town upside down. Skipping Stones deftly and beautifully explores the myriad layers of grief that come while healing from a life-altering catastrophe.",
