Unable to stop his hiccups, Daffy decides to seek medical help, in a old house belonging to a Dr. Jerkyl, who advertises his services on a neon sign atop his house. Examining the hiccupping Daffy, Jerkyl decides to use a \"scare cure\" and chemically transforms himself into a goofy lug named Chloe, to whom Daffy had been assigned to deliver the message- a birthday greeting. Chloe chases Daffy around the house, until Daffy uses a syringe to squirt formula into Chloe's mouth, transforming him into a mischievous infant.",
