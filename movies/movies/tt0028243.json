      "description": "The Shadow - 1933.  This is not the shadow that \"knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men;\" this shadow is a blackmailer, and the bad guy. It stars Henry Kendall, Elizabeth Allan, and Felix Aylmer.  More information can be found on the IMDB website, if you're into all that.  As for me, I just like watching old movies! The source for this upload can be found elsewhere on archive.org.  I cleaned up the audio and decided to share it back to this site.",
