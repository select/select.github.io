      "description": "Those insidious undocumented space aliens are back again to steal our high-paying hotel maid and cabbage-picker jobs! The night of alien terror begins with previews of coming invasions. Then in “Devil Girl From Mars” a dominatrix and her packing crate robot are on the hunt for helpless Earth men who are good breeding stock. Next up is “It Conquered the World,” Roger Corman’s ripoff of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” to which Roger added a Venusian monster the film crew named “Beulah.” It’s time to put on your aluminium foil hats.",
