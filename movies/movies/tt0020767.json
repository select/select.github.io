    "Plot": "The circus is in town and heralds its coming with a parade. Elephants dance with bells on their feet, and even turn their trunks into steering wheels and pretend to be cars. The giraffes dance, too, with wooden clogs on their feet. The mouse clown in the parade performs somersaults, but his impressive antics are mainly for his girlfriend, the mouse bareback rider who is just ahead of him, blowing kisses from her fat horse. The side show features a scantily-clad fat lady, who shakes her exposed buttocks provocatively, enticing the audience to flock inside the tent. Inside, the bareback rider performs her gravity-defying stunts. The clown forms his arms into a hoop for leopards to leap through. He even makes the \"okay\" sign, and a leopard defies physics by jumping through his fingers (and losing his spots in the process). The ringmaster doubles as a lion tamer and performs a dance with a ferocious lion, who ends the routine by kicking his tamer in the rear. The clown angers the ringmaster by laughing at him. The ringmaster retaliates by adding extra gunpowder to the clown's cannon, causing it to shoot him through the tent and out of sight. When the clown returns, he discovers the ringmaster has stolen his two-timing girlfriend.",
