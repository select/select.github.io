      "description": "Gertie LaRue (Francine Everett) is a nightclub entertainer from the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. She arrives on the Caribbean island of \"Rinidad\" to perform as the headliner in a revue at the Paradise Hotel. Gertie has earned the nickname \"Dirty Gertie\" for the casual nature in which she entices and then humiliates men. On the island, she attracts the attention of two U.S. military officers – a soldier and a sailor – whom she nicknames \"Tight Pants\" and \"High Pockets,\" respectively. The men enjoy sharing Gertie’s affections. However, Diamond Joe, the owner of the hotel, finds himself falling for Gertie and begins to shower her with gifts. Gertie also attracts the attention of two missionaries – Mr. Christian and Ezra Crumm – who keep watch on Gertie’s activities. However, a former boyfriend from Harlem tracks Gertie to the island...
