      "description": "Swords and Hearts, D W Griffith 1911. Griffith returns to the Civil war, this time with a story of a Southern officer, who when he returns from the war, finds his fiance attached to a Northern officer, but all is well, the poor but honest girl who saved him from death still loves him. It is not bad and worth a look. I have added music and some sounds. While these Biograph shorts may seem simplistic to us today, pause to consider how exciting they must have been to audience who may never have seen a movie before.",

    "Plot": "As Hugh Frazier, son of a wealthy tobacco planter, leaves to join his company in the Confederate Army, he becomes engaged to Irene Lambert, a beautiful, but cold and calculating girl, who promises her hand when he returns victorious. Unknown to Hugh, Jennie Baker, a little girl of the \"poor white class,\" has fallen passionately in love with him. Her father is one of those who hate the \"aristocrats,\" eking an existence selling berries, etc., from their little garden. Hugh, making a flying visit to Irene, is only saved from capture by Jennie's devotion, she taking his horse and donning his hat and coat, by which she leads his pursuers astray. That night, Jennie's father is killed leading an attack by Bushwhackers upon the Frazier Mansion in an attempt to secure the family wealth, but old Ben, the negro servant, anticipates their designs by taking the family strong box and burying it. The Bushwhackers, however, burn the old mansion to the ground, Hugh's father, perishing in the ruins. Hence, when Hugh returns, he finds himself homeless. Irene has turned her attentions upon a Union officer, but Jennie is still faithful. Hugh now sees her worth, and old Ben appears with the strong box which has remained hidden since the night of the attack.",
