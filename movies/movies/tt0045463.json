Williams traces the ring to Marseilles, France, where he meets Margo Wayne (Suzanne Dalbert) at a waterfront café and discovers she is part of the plot. When recalled by Reagan, Williams is informed that he has been engaged in a \"war games\" security check to test America's atomic defense, but he proves to Reagan that enemy agents are actually using the \"war games\" as a front to smuggle an A-bomb into the country.",
