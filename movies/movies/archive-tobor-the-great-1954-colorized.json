      "description": "A boy genius (Billy Chapin) befriends the robot being developed by his grandfather (Taylor Holmes) as a test pilot for space travel, with help from a disgruntled NASA scientist (Charles Drake). But a foreign spy (Steven Geray) is determined to steal the technology. Also included: The 1957 TV pilot \"Here Comes Tobor\" starring Tommy Terrell and Arthur Space. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
