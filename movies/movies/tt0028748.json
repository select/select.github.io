They are still on Page 1 when an intoxicated man wanders into their room, collapses and they, looking for identification, find $15,000 in his pockets. On the assumption that me might be a blackmailer, the three decide to build a scenario around him. Things become a bit more involved when the man is later found to be murdered.",
