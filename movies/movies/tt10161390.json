    "Plot": "The \"Film about the Father\" is a difficult genre. Andreas Goldstein, son of the GDR cultural functionary Klaus Gysi (1912-1999) has tackled this task with a complete lack of vanity, but with insistence: measured and calm, honest and intellectual, analytical and personal. He uncovers a mosaic that renounces both the teleologies of the self-styled winners of history and the simplifications of (West) German Oscar nominees. This film is not about the lives of others, but about his own life. Not about yesterday, about today, too.",
