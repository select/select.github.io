      "description": "Scheveningen is a fishing village on the Dutch North Sea coast bordering the city of The Hague, the residence of the Dutch government. In this film you will see the daily activities of Scheveningen's many fishermen almost a century ago. To large extent the film is self-explanatory. Therefore no commentry has been added but in stead this is my first full documentary with only added ambient sound. It was a lot of work to chose the right sounds and get them properly synchronized. You will see hectic activities of the quays of both Scheveningen's harbours, traders bidding for freshly caught fish, barrels of fish being filled and handled, children hanging about and pinching chunks of ice that have broken off huge ice bars, women making and repairing nets, nets being layed out to dry using horses and carts, fish being cleaned and hung on metal rods to be smoked and much more. The original, rather poor quality, B&W film has been restored, enhanced and colorized with the latest A.I. video software.
