      "description": "Salvage Hunters Season 1, Episode 5\n\nDrew calls on some legendary hoarders like Chris, who collects cement mixers and has an herbaceous car park, but see if he will be able to persuade anyone to actually sell their stuff.\n\nAs owner of one of the largest decorative salvage yards in the United Kingdom -- Fabulously British Salvage -- Drew Pritchard is always looking for new pieces to replenish his shop, and he has no problem scouring the countryside to find them. This series follows Drew all over the country, including some privileged estates, as he hunts for old and forgotten pieces of history. But finding them is only part of the business; Drew must then convince the owner of each item to sell it to him at a fair price, then it's off to the salvage yard, where his team restores it to its original shine before it can be sold for profit.\n\nNarrated by: Ralph Ineson\n2011\nStars: Drew Pritchard\n\r\nMORE Popcornflix MOVIES, FREE on YouTube!\r\n\r\n Action: https://bit.ly/2XC8pvv\r\n Romance: https://bit.ly/2NVnIQ2\r\n Horror: https://bit.ly/2LeNNaK\r\n Crime: https://bit.ly/2NK201z\r\n Drama: https://bit.ly/2G6Uasy\r\n Comedy:  https://bit.ly/2LPCNQD\r\n Western: https://bit.ly/2S7FRc4\r\n Popcornflix Channel page: https://bit.ly/2Saak9p\r\n\r\nWatch more free movies and TV series at Popcornflix.com, or on the Popcornflix app available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Chromecast, and AppleTV.\r\n\r\n#Popcornflix, Full length free movies and TV series.\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Popcornflix\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Popcornflixnews\r\nPopcornflix is owned/operated by Screen Media Ventures",
