    "Plot": "Famous Studios' cartoons are not for all tastes, but my opinion is that their early stuff and some of the early 50s output are good. While they were very formulaic they were always well animated and voiced with some funny parts, some poignancy and decent characters and their regular composer Winston Sharples could always be relied on to write a great and often outstanding score.Admittedly though, by the mid-50s through to the late-60s Famous Studios' cartoons did get repetitive. While Sharples' music still shone and the voice actors did their best the animation suffered due to lower budgets and tighter deadlines, the humour became more tired and slow in timing than sharp and funny, the stories became increasingly predictable and rehashed and some characters started losing their initial spark, this is particularly true of most of the later Herman and Katnip cartoons.There are better Casper cartoons than 'Spunky Skunky' but that doesn't stop it from being a sweet and touching cartoon. Certainly nowhere near among the worst of Famous Studios' output, being closer to the quality of their early cartoons while showing a couple of signs of what would happen later. Structurally, in terms of story and dialogue, there is nothing new so there is a more of the same and extremely predictable feel (as ever though did appreciate the swift but gentle tone of the story), and the dialogue is a little twee and forgettable outside of the animals ostracizing the poor skunk.Animation-wise, apart from a little roughness in the drawing occasionally, is beautifully done, thankfully being closer to the very fluid and detailed animation style of the early output rather than the sparser and flatter style of the studio's later cartoons. The colours are vibrant and atmospheric and the backgrounds are meticulous and colourful in their detail. Winston Sharples' music score here is typically merry and whimsical, it's beautifully orchestrated, energetic and adds so much to the mood, then again his music has always been one of the best assets of the Famous Studios cartoons.While not one of the funniest Casper cartoons, the humour is amusing and gentle, while the reactions towards Casper nice and varied (the pig's especially) and the chemistry between Casper and the adorable skunk is very cute without being too sentimental or cloying. The characters are very endearing, and the voice acting is dependably strong.On the whole, not great but good and very sweet. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
