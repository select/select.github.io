      "description": "Victor Frankenstein (puzzlingly called \"Count\" Frankenstein here) discovers neanderthals living in a cave near his castle. When one of them is injured, Frankenstein revives him as his newest cut-n-paste creation, a giant fuzzy haired beast called \"Goliath\". He even has help from an servant named \"Ygor\" Meanwhile, Frankenstein's perverted dwarf assistant \"Genz\" has befriended an older, mute, cave dweller; a hairy wild-man named \"Ook\" and uses him to procure young lovelies for Genz to fondle, as well as to take revenge on his unsympathetic master. Meanwhile, Frankenstein is courting his daughter's best friend who is young enough to be his granddaughter, and the village people are becoming suspicious about the goings on at Castle Frankenstein (But, don't they always?) and also want to know who is lurking in the neanderthal's cave. Another European horror that attempts to imitate the Hammer style and falls a bit short. As always, the final product is bizarre, but in this case its not as bad as you may have heard. This is the superior European edit of the film and is more entertaining than the U.S. release, which repeated the same sequences a few times and pointlessly rearranged some scenes. Incredibly, one of the actor's is credited as Boris Lugosi!?!? I have wonder if Bela Karloff is in this film too. Uncredited perhaps. Note also, that four different actors are credited as Frankenstein's \"Monsters\". This film is available from home video companies that are know to deal exclusively in Public Domain properties. No ownership is claimed.",
