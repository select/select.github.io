      "description": "A hitchhiker is badly hurt when the car he is in crashes, and he loses his memory. Two years later, a clue leads him to his old home town, where he discovers that he was the prime suspect in a murder. As he tries to determine the truth about the murder, he is pursued by gangsters and encounters several seductive women. Based on the novel by Mickey Spillane Anthony Quinn as Johnny McBride Charles Coburn as Gardiner Gene Evans as Servo Peggie Castle as Venus Mary Ellen Kay as Wendy Miller Shawn Smith as Carol Shay Dolores Donlon as Troy Avalon Barry Kelley as Tucker James Millican as Police Captain Lindsey I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
