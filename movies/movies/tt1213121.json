    "Plot": "Felix Mayol enters the stage and sings his music hall song.Edison had announced his plans to combine his gramophone with movies even before his labs had a finished movie. In 1896, the company produced a film in which Blackton played a violin while his assistants danced. Some early sound films came out in 1900, and in 1905, Gaumont began a series of three-minute shorts, usually of music hall acts like this one.Exhibition was plagued by lack of appropriate venues, synchronization problems, and technology that could not produce sound loud enough for an audience. Those problems would not be solved for two decades.",
