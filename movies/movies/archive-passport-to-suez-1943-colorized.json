      "description": "Michael Lanyard (Warren William), a reformed jewel thief once known as the Lone Wolf, agrees to go to Alexandria, Egypt, to help the Allied cause during World War II. But the head of a Nazi spy ring kidnaps his valet Jamison (Eric BLore), forcing Lanyard to steal some documents from a safe at British Intelligence, purported to be the plans for the minefields and defences of the Suez Canal. Complications ensue. Featuring Ann Savage as reporter Valerie King, Sheldon Leonard as nighclub owner Johnny Booth, Lloyd Bridges as henchman Fritz I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
