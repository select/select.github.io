      "description": "This is a compilation of rare and familiar footage about the D-day landings in Normandy, France on the 6th of June 1944. This \"Operation Overlord\" was the most important phase of the assult on Germany that eventually ended WW-II. For the first time this footage is presented in color! The film shows the preparations of the invasion of Europe in the South of England, especially near Weymouth. Spectacular footage shows the perils that the soldiers had to endure while leaving the relative safe enclosure of the landing craft. In one scene soldiers barely escape for bullets that can be clearly seen hitting the water a few feet away. This is not the famous movie \"D-day the sixth of June\" but actual and real footage\". After capturing the five beaches, named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword (from West to East), soldiers can be seen commencing their attack on German position more inland as well as the capture of numerous German POW's. The original B&W footage has been motion-stabilized, contrast- & brightness enhanced, de-noised, upscaled and restored to full HD and artificially colorized with state-of-the-art A.I. software.
