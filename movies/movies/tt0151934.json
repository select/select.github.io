    "Plot": "It's the operetta about the peg-legged pirate hippopotamus trying to kidnap the hero's girlfriend again in this Terrytoon directed by Moser and Terry.In this period, each iteration of a particular Terrytoon plot -- and Paul Terry reused his limited number of stories as often as Mack Sennett had -- showed some technical advance. Terry had been laying off operettas for a few months, having his musical director Philip Scheib do background scores, the sort of music that A movies use to get the audience in the mood for a particular scene. With the return of the operetta form to Terrytoons, we have a larger orchestra and a score that supports that sense, at least for the exciting battle scenes. It's the sort of sound that Scheib would use for the next decade; the style of orchestration would be used in Mighty Mouse cartoons, and even the Heckle &amp; Jeckle shorts when things got busy.However, while the music is good, the cartoon is more of the same.",
