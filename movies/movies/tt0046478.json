      "description": "By the time he made  Ugetsu,  Kenji Mizoguchi was already an elder statesman of Japanese cinema, fiercely revered by Akira Kurosawa and other directors of a younger generation. And with this exquisite ghost story, a fatalistic wartime tragedy derived from stories by Akinari Ueda and Guy de Maupassant, he created a touchstone of his art, his long takes and sweeping camera guiding the viewer through a delirious narrative about two villagers whose pursuit of fame and fortune leads them far astray from their loyal wives. Moving between the terrestrial and the otherworldly,  Ugetsu  reveals essential truths about the ravages of war, the plight of women, and the pride of men. Ugetsu  was restored by The Film Foundation and Kadokawa Corporation at Cineric Laboratories in New York. Special thanks to Masahiro Miyajima and Martin Scorsese for their consultation on this restoration. Restoration funding provided by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in association with The Film Foundation and Kadokawa Corporation.",

      "description": "Ugetsu is a 1953 Japanese period fantasy film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi starring Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō.  It is based on the stories \"The House in the Thicket\" and \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" from Ueda Akinari's 1776 book Ugetsu Monogatari, combining elements of the jidaigeki genre with a ghost story. Drawing from Ueda's tales, the film is set in Japan's civil war–torn Azuchi–Momoyama period. It  follows two brothers, Genjūrō and Tōbei, during Japan's civil war as they pursue their ambitions—Genjūrō as a potter and Tōbei as a would-be samurai. Their quests lead to tragic consequences for their families, highlighting themes of greed, ambition, and the haunting effects of war.",
