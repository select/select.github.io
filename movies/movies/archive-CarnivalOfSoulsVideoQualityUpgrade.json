      "description": "This version was sourced from a high quality 1.3GB Windows Media file found elsewhere at IA which didn't fully derive, and so there wasn't a streaming version. This new upload has been converted to a 642MB mpeg4 (mp4) file with no loss in apparent video quality. A low-key supernatural horror that proved you don't need mega bucks or a Hollywood studio to make a highly effective genre film. Directed by Herk Harvey Released in 1962 a.k.a. \"Corridors of Evil\" Complete print",
