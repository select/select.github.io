      "description": "Using standard red/blue-green 3D glasses, you can view this trip down Market Street filmed in 1906 as if you are actually there! Some of the amazing things you see in this version is the realization that at one point you are definitly going uphill, and the reflections in the water are quite startling. This was done in Adobe Premiere Elements 9, manually (i.e., not run through a pseudo-3D converter program.) It uses all the information in the original film to produce a true 3D effect.",
