      "description": "Young Mr. Jazz Directed by Hal Roach Produced by Hal Roach Starring Harold Lloyd Release date April 20, 1919 Country United States Languages Silent English intertitles Young Mr. Jazz is a 1919 American short comedy film featuring Harold Lloyd . A print of the film survives in the film archive of the Museum of Modern Art . [ 1 ] Plot Bebe is escorted to a beach by her father. The moment the father walks away from Bebe, Harold approaches her. The father returns and proceeds to violently dissuade Harold's amorous intentions. By tunneling through the sand, Harold manages to speak to Bebe briefly and arranges to take her dancing that night. Shortly after Harold picks her up for their date in his automobile, Bebe's father sees them and angrily follows the couple in his car. Harold and Bebe try to elude him by going into a seedy establishment called the Bowery Cafe. Within a short time both Harold and Bebe have had their money and valuables stolen by a team of pickpockets. Harold realizes his money is gone only when his waiter tries to collect the bill for Harold and Bebe's drinks. The couple dances to avoid a confrontation with the waiter. Eventually Bebe's father enters the cafe and he too is robbed. A large fight ensues in which Harold acrobatically knocks out all the ruffians in the cafe. This action puts Harold in the good graces of Bebe's father.
