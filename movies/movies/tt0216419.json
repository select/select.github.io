And just like that, the sensational curiosity is uncovered, revealing an enormous and magnificent folding fan composed of seven intricately-embroidered branches which house a septet of youthful ladies-in-waiting. Next, a beautiful minuet ensues, as the mesdemoiselles' costumes dissolve into fine noble ensembles. What an exquisite spectacle, worthy of an emperor.",
