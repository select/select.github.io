      "description": "A curious reporter (Peggie Castle) discovers that the complete destruction of a small town was caused by giant locusts that were accidentally enlarged by a scientist (Peter Graves) experimenting with radioactivity to increase plant growth. They must be stopped before they overrun Chicago. Peter Graves as Dr. Ed Wainwright Peggie Castle as Audrey Aimes Morris Ankrum as Gen. John Hanson Than Wyenn as Frank Johnson Thomas Browne Henry as Col. Tom Sturgeon Richard Benedict as Cpl. Mathias James Seay as Capt. James Barton John Close as Maj. Everett I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
