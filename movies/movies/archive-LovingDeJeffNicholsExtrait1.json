      "description": "The story behind the historic Civil Rights case is a showcase for both actors' talent. Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple, are sentenced to prison in Virginia in 1958 for getting married. “Loving” celebrates the real-life courage and commitment of an interracial couple, Richard and Mildred Loving, who married and then spent the next nine years fighting for the right to live as a family in their hometown. Their civil rights case, Loving v. Virginia, went all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 1967 reaffirmed the very foundation of the right to marry – making their love story an inspiration to couples everywhere.",
