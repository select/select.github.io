    "Plot": "Mickey is selling hot dogs at a carnival next to the tent for Minnie the Shimmy Dancer. He gets into an argument with the barker. Minnie beckons him over to her trailer; he shows off the tricks his pups have been trained to do, and she picks one. It climbs onto the bun but runs away when she bites in. Later that evening, Mickey plays guitar and two cats sing outside Minnie's window; they eventually awaken someone, who throws things at them until they stop.",
