      "description": "Wilfred Owen, a renowned English poet, volunteers to serve on the front lines during World War I. Stationed in the trenches of Flanders, what he witnesses horrifies him and drives him to write a long poem depicting his experience with biting bitterness and haunting words. He would die on November 4, 1918 — just one week before the armistice that ended the war.\n\n⭐️ STARRING\nNathaniel Parker as Wilfred Owen\nTilda Swinton as The Nurse\nLaurence Olivier as The Old Soldier\nPatricia Hayes as Mother\nSean Bean as The German Soldier\n\n🎬 CREW\nWritten & Directed by Derek Jarman \nMusic by Benjamin Britten (War Requiem)\nCinematography by Richard Greatrex\n\nWHY WATCH?\nSir Laurence Olivier's final bow – a moving performance that echoes through time\nUnique sensory experience: Britten's choral masterpiece fused with Jarman's haunting visuals\nCult cinema gold – an avant-garde war film that shatters conventions like a grenade in a gallery!\n\n🔔 SUBSCRIBE @CultCinemaClassics\nWar • Drama • Experimental",
