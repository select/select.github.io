      "description": "An English botanist (Peter Cushing) studying rare herbs at a remote lamasery in the Himalayas joins an expedition to find the legendary Yeti, against the wishes of his wife (Maureen Connell), only to discover that the intent of its gruff American leader (Forrest Tucker) is to capture or kill one and bring it back for commercial display. Written by Nigel Kneale Directed by Val Guest I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
