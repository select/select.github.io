      "description": "The 2am Theater shamefully presents another insomniac double feature. This time it's all about the ladies (and some guys in gorilla suits). The sweaty safari begins with coming attractions and a cartoon, followed by the first feature, \"Nabonga,\" with Julie London. The intermission featurette is chapter 2 of the serial \"Perils of the Darkest Jungle\" (a.k.a. \"The Tiger Woman\") with Linda Sterling. The second feature presentation is \"Blonde Savage\" with Gale Sherwood and Veda Ann Borg. NOTE: The complete serial \"Perils of the Darkest Jungle,\" which is highly recommended for matinee serial fans, is available on DVD from the Roan Group. All the other items in this simulation are found in various IA collections.",
