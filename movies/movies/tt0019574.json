      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Clyde De Vinna won an Academy Award for cinematography in this strange romance tragedy that takes place on a series of Polynesian islands. While the film was a huge box office success, critics were less pleased. In addition, some audiences were annoyed that the film advertised itself as a sound picture, when there is very little dialogue in the film. ",
