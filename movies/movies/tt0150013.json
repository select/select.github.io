    "Plot": "Van Beuren cartoons are extremely variable, especially in the number of gags and whether the absurdist humour shines through enough (sometimes it does, other times it doesn't), but are strangely interesting. Although they are often poorly animated with barely existent stories and less than compelling lead characters, they are also often outstandingly scored, there can be some fun support characters and some are well-timed and amusing.The final The Little King cartoon made by Van Beuren, and The Little King's penultimate cartoon appearance (Fleischer did the last, 'Betty Boop and The Little King', as part of the Betty Boop series), despite the low rating here (main reason seems to be not enough votes) 'Cactus King' is an above decent not for Van Beuren's version of the character to go out on. Other cartoons in the series may have been a little more successful in staying faithful to Otto Soglow's visual and humour style, a little more visually unusual and slightly more charming than seen here in 'Cactus King', but it's still a nice effort.'Cactus King' is generically plotted and has little surprising in content and conflict. While most energetic, some of the pace is on the routine side.Actually though, there is a huge amount to like about 'Cactus King' and it vastly outweighs the flaws. It demonstrates why Van Beuren's cartoons adapted from Soglow's work are among the studio's better, more ambitious and more entertaining efforts. One expects Van Beuren cartoons to generally not be well animated. That's not the case with 'Cactus King', the studio's Soglow adaptations come to think of it were all among their better-looking cartoons and showed more detail and crispness. 'Cactus King' is also one of the most visually interesting The Little King cartoons, especially a quite beautifully done opening sequence that is on par with the animation of the staircase in The Little King's introductory cartoon 'The Fatal Note'.Music as always with Van Beuren, very nearly always the best thing about their cartoons and sometimes the only good thing, is lively and beautifully and cleverly orchestrated. The gags are amusing, well-timed and charming, if not quite as subtle as in the first two Van Beuren/Soglow cartoons. The ending is very exciting and The Little King carries the cartoon well. To summarise, above decent cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
