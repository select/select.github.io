    "Plot": "On an airliner bound for Hong Kong, Tony Dumont (Rory Calhoun) is attracted to a pretty novelist, Pamela Vincent (Barbara Rush), who returns the attention. The plane is held up by a hi-jacking gang and a shipment of diamonds are stole. Dumont is actually the master-mind of a diamond-smuggling syndicate operating from Macao. Warned by Mama Lin (Soo Yong), that he might lose his sweetheart, Jean Blake (Dolores Donlon), because of his attention to Pamela, Tony is so infatuated with Pamela, that he double-crosses the gang and follows Pamela to San Francisco, taking the diamonds with him. There, she brushes him off. Now hunted by both the police and the syndicate, he returns to Macao.",
