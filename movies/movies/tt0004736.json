[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Reviews The reviewer for Bioscope wrote, \"Here Chaplin plays the role of the undesired but persistent suitor. The comic element is given special prominence and is quite safe in the hands of this well known comedian.\" A reviewer from Kinematograph Weekly wrote, \"Plenty of the comic element is introduced and the person who does not laugh at the peculiar antics of Chas. Chaplin--well, must be hard to please.\" Cast Charlie Chaplin – Pickpocket Minta Durfee – Woman Edgar Kennedy – Lover Gordon Griffith – Boy Chester Conklin – Pickpocket Josef Swickard – Victim Hank Mann – Sleeper [ 4 ] Eva Nelson References 1 Neibaur, James L.
