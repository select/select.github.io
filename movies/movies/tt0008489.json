      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This was the first film adaptation of the gentleman thief, though certainly not the last. This is also the earliest film starring John Barrymore that is not lost at this time. Contemporary reviews do not seem to have survived, although records exist showing that the film was censored in parts of the country. Modern reviews find it a charming but ordinary crime drama. ",
