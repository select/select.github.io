      "description": "Enhanced and AI colorized film about the beautiful village Giethoorn in The Netherlands in 1921. Giethoorn is a very picturesq village of many islands and old farms in the North East of the Netherlands. It has many canals and small pole-driven boats called \"punters\" that transport goods and people along the houses. Some people call Giethoorn the \"Dutch Venice\". The canals were made during early years when turf was dug as fuel to heat the old houses and farms. Many houses and farms are only reachable by barge or via the old wooden bridges. In recent years swarms of tourists used to visit Giethoorn, many from China. Covid has temporarily put a halt to that. This film has been restored and colorized by means of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence software Timeline: 00:00 Travelling by boat though Giethoorn's canals 00:05 Two Men in a \"Punter\" 00:10 Passing a farm with two haystacks 00:18 Side channel leading to a farm 00:28 More haystacks 00:32 Side canal with three Punters 00:36 Ducks in a side channel 00:41 Passing a farm 00:45 Two farms and a small bridge 00:52 Characteristic wooden pedestrian bridge 01:03 Beautiful scene 01:11 A wooden bridge in the distance 01:32 Wider canal on the outskirts of Giethoorn 01:44 Man in a Punter 01:52 Passing a farm with two children in the farmyard 02:02 Houses in Giethoorn 02:09 Notice the metal milkcan 02:13 Pedestrian passing across a bridge 02:22 Passing under a bridge 02:32 A haystack near the canal 02:37 Canal junction 02:42 Passing under another bridge 02:48 Three bridges in a row 02:55 The local church and graveyard 03:12 Another wonderful scene 03:25 Milkcan on the left 03:35 Punter in the distance 03:40 Looking back 03:50 Wooden bridge close-up with cyclist spectator 04:05 Spectacular view under two bridges 04:20 The third bridge 04:30 The fourth bridge 04:35 A busy canal 04:50 More Punters 05:08 Four bridges in a row 05:20 Getting tired of all these bridges? 05:28 Farmhouse near a bridge 05:42 Another canal 05:50 Punter goes under two bridges 06:00 Two women in local costume 06:04 Wooded scene 06:20 Punters and Haystacks (again!) 06:37 The End The music \"La Vie En Rose\" is kindly provided by the Belgian pianist Franco Di Nitto: https://www.youtube.com/user/pianist626262 Source: BeeldEnGeluid The Netherlands.",
