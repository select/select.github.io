      "description": "From IMDB: Petite waitress Johnny works and lives in a truck-stop, where she's lonely and longs for love. She develops a crush on garbage-truck driver Krassky, although her sleazy boss Boris warns her that he's gay. ---- This one may still fall into the French New Wave genre, it is atmospheric and slow moving. All of the characters have a rather desperate aspect to them, but managed to be interesting rather than repellent.",
