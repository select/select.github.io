Intrigued, she teams up with skeptical marine biologist Steve Dunning (Stuart Wade) to uncover the truth. When a diver's mysterious death and her own terrifying encounter confirm the creature’s existence, Julie’s quick thinking provides crucial evidence. Now convinced, Dunning takes to the depths in a daring submarine battle against the monstrous predator.\n\nColorized version https://youtu.be/a7KH7vG3ca8\n\n\nDirector: Wyott Ordung\nWriter: Bill Danch\nProducer: Roger Corman\nStars: Anne Kimbell, Stuart Wade, Dick Pinner\n\n\n@CultCinemaClassics \n\nMore Roger Corman movies: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdYLD4ZQC1D1o3WC_ePvnOng",
