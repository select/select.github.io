      "description": "The Fleischer Superman cartoons are a series of 17 Technicolor animated shorts released by Paramount Pictures, marking Superman’s first appearance in animation. Produced initially by Fleischer Studios (1941–1942) and later by Famous Studios (1942–1943), they were the last animated series created by Fleischer before the studio’s transition. Now in the U.S. public domain, the original 35mm masters and merchandising rights are owned by Warner Bros.\n\n00:00:00 EP 01      \n00:10:20 EP 02      \n00:18:58 EP 03      \n00:25:57 EP 04      \n00:32:58 EP 05      \n00:39:34 EP 06      \n00:45:44 EP 07      \n00:53:00 EP 08      \n00:59:29 EP 09      \n01:06:24 EP 10      \n01:14:03 EP 11      \n01:20:59 EP 12      \n01:27:33 EP 13      \n01:34:41 EP 14      \n01:41:03 EP 15      \n01:47:39 EP 16      \n01:54:28 EP 17\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdYTMq_LE7cyJT3fio8pHOP8\n\n@CultCinemaClassics",
