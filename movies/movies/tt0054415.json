      "description": "An international team embarks on an expedition to claim the moon, but they encounter aliens there who instruct them to leave. Ken Clark as Capt. John Anderson Michi Kobi as Dr. Hideko Murata Tom Conway as Dr. Feodor Orloff Anthony Dexter as Dr. Luis Vargas John Wengraf as Dr. Erich Heinrich Robert Montgomery Jr. as Roddy Murdock Phillip Baird as Dr. William Rochester Richard Weber as Dr. David Ruskin Muzaffer Tema Bey as Dr. Selim Hamid Roger Til as Dr. Etienne Martel Cory Devlin as Dr. Asmara Markonen Anna-Lisa as Dr. Sigrid Bomark Francis X. Bushman as Secretary General of the International Space Order I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
