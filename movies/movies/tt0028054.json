Arriving out west in Turquoise City, supposedly incognito, but with her pictures in newspapers coast-to-coasts she is recognized by crooked nightclub-owner Martin Simms ( Keefe) who hires her, using the name of Jane Edwards, to sing in his joint while he notifies Scarlotti of her whereabouts hoping to collect a reward from the Gangster. The latter wastes no time getting there since she was the only witness to his crime and he wants to get her before the police do. Singing Sheriff Gene Autry (Gene Autry), already troubled by the O'Keefe Brothers, and his deputy Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) come to Eleanor's aid and round-up the gangsters during a wild cattle stampede.",
