The former military Jake Townsend seeks news from his brother in the base where he serves, and stumbles into the alien Jude. He is wounded and explains that he needs to find a weapon before the other alien, Kronnan, activates it to destroy Earth. They team up with Jake's former girlfriend Monica Gray to search for the weapon while they are hunted down by Kronnan and a paramilitary team. But when Jake meets Kronnan, he says that Jude is the one who intends to activate the destructive weapon. Who is telling the truth?",
