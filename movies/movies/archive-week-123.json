      "description": "Hello and welcome back to your cinematic playground for summer fun and simpler times. Tonight, we turn the clock back to the 1930's for some vintage thrills with everyone's favorite jungle hero, Tarzan. First up, after some MGM previews, we begin with Buster Crabbe as \"Tarzan - The Fearless\", a condensed feature of a \"lost\" serial which basically restates the Jungle Lord's origin without Jane. Next up, we finish things up with \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\" as well as \"Tarzan And The Green Goddess\". Both films were sourced from another serial actually written and produced by Tarzan's creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs. Though not as polished as their MGM counterparts, these two features do show the ape-man more or less as Burroughs' envisioned him, but once again... no Jane! So sit back and welcome Summer with some steamy jungle adventures and let your trouble float down river into unknown lands and evil cults. And d on't forget w e also have an APP and a website.
