    "Plot": "The great idea not being waking up with telekinetic powers, but having someone wake up with telekinetic powers quickly realizing that a great career as a mover (and shaker) of furniture may lie ahead of him. The furniture animation is hilarious and quite good. This is something entirely different from feuillade´s more famous crime serials, and hopefully everyone in the world will someday be able to see this. In the meantime, let´s hope for more furniture animation in today´s cinema.",
