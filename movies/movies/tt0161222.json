    "Plot": "According to the IMDb, this cartoon is nine minutes in length. The copy I saw on Youtube was five and a half minutes in length and the print was dark and muddy. The usual story of Aladdin is truncated to 1: Aladdin gets bopped with the lamp and the genie pops up; 2: a large number of riding thieves steal the lamp and Aladdin pursues; 3: Aladdin's lady love is taken to the Sultan, where she is rescued by Aladdin.That take about two minutes. The remainder of the cartoon is occupied with gags, mostly transformation gags typical of the rubber-tube era of cartooning. They are decent. However, if you're looking for the Aladdin story, this is not the place to find it.",
