    "Plot": "The second in a series of films, produced by Jack Goldberg and Arthur Leonard, made primarily for the six hundred eighty-four theaters (in 1947) that catered exclusively to Black audiences that were kept out, or placed in a special balcony section, in most of the theaters in segregated America. The plot concerns a struggling band leader's rise to fame after overcoming many obstacles, including a bad-girl vs. good-girl situation. For reasons unknown, Freddie Bartholomew makes a guest-cameo appearnce at the night club, and was featured in the ads and posters for the film, but the producers were barking up an empty tree if they thought was that he would sell any extra tickets in any of the booking situations...black or white. Tondaleyo (the \"bad girl\") dances, and musical numbers feature Deek Watson and his Brown Dots, Walter Fuller's orchestra, John Kirby's band and Ruble Blakey, former soloist with Lionel Hampton.",
