      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This comedy follows a young man guaranteed an inheritance from his grandfather, if he can get married in time. Reviews and box office returns from the time of release don't seem to have been very noteworthy for this little picture, but modern viewers mostly think of it as a cute, though contrived, comedy.  Sourced from \"Nikola Tesla Wireless Radio\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG5xIWVcbsE",

Her airplane is delayed, and Parker, to whom Peter is in debt, insists that his own girl friend, Julia, pose as Peter's wife. Alice is informed by Joe Blair that Peter is actually married to Julia; she agrees to marry Joe if this is true; and they are pursued by Bull, a motorcycle policeman who loves Julia.
