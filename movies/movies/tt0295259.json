    "Plot": "Finis Terræ is a 1929 French silent drama film written and directed by Jean Epstein. The story centres on a small group of men harvesting seaweed off the coast of Brittany, and the problems which arise when one of them gets an infected thumb. The film's title is the old Latin name of the region Finistère, where the story is set, and means \"End of the Earth\". The film is shot in a documentary-like style, with local non-actors in all roles, and frequent handheld camerawork. Also, Epstein often inserts slow motion footage.",
