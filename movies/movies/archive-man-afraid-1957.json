In the struggle, Lisa's eyes are hurt and David throws an ornament, unintentionally killing the young thief. It's not easy for Reverend Collins to deal with the resulting publicity, his own conscience, or Lisa's temporary blindness. Meanwhile Carl Simmons, father of the dead burglar, begins to stalk the Collins' son Michael.",
