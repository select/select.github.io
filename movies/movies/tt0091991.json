As a result, with his self-made millionaire father refusing to pay the tuition to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School, Mark's only hope rests on a full scholarship intended for an African-American applicant, and a bunch of tanning pills. Now, with his curly perm and the dark complexion, Mark can fraudulently make his dream come true; however, has Mark ever considered the ramifications, moral and legal, of his deception?",
