    "Plot": "Betty Boop is performing in a stage melodrama with a pretty-boy for a romantic hero and the usual slimy moustache-twirler for a villain. The villain, of course, wants Betty for his own. He ties the hero to a tree and then goes to work tempting Betty. He shows her an enormous diamond with a tiny light bulb inside to make it light up. He shows her a plate of oysters, each with a pearl inside. He shows her a fur coat that moths eat up the moment she rejects it. Nothing works. He resorts to grabbing her and throwing her inside his hot-air balloon, where he hopes to escape from the pretty-boy hero.",
