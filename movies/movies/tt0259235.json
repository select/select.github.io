The first feature presentation is the classic Edgar Wallace old dark house mystery, \"The Case of the Frightened Lady,\" followed by a Robert Benchley short, \"Home Movies.\" Then the rising body count in a London lodging house baffles Scotland Yard in \"Shadows on the Stairs,\" with a worthy ensemble cast that includes Turhan Bey in his screen debut.",

All is not well on young Lord Lebanon's ancestral estate, what with his mother's constant nagging and the chauffeur turning up dead, in this Edgar Wallace mystery with a good cast and rising body count.
