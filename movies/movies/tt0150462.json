    "Plot": "This is a wonderful adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, done with typical attention to detail by the UPA studio and featuring the voice of Hans Conreid.  Given his rich and distinctive voice, it is hardly surprising that Conreid did quite a bit of voice work in animation, both narration and character acting.  While never identified as the  primary vocal talent for a studio, Conreid did work for most of them, particularly Lantz and Disney.  He's perfect here, appropriately gullible and smarmy by turns.  Well worth the effort to track down.  Recommended.",
