    "Plot": "Gene Gerrard,a totally forgotten actor,plays the lead,in this fairly uninspired farce based on a play by P.G.Woodhouse.Most of this film is set on a boat anchored in Monte Carlo.Gerrard is accused of assaulting a prince in the casino.He pretends to be his twin brother Alfred who is expected to arrive at any moment.However it turns out that the twin has been invented by the Trustee of his settlement to hide the trustees embezzlement of the fund.it then transpires that Gerrard is being praised for assisting the Prince not assaulting him.however he has made it difficult for himself by stating that only Alfred has a mole on the back of his neck.All pretty convoluted and not that funny",
