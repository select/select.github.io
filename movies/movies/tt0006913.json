    "Plot": "Ruth Sands, an eastern girl, arrives at Coyote Flats, to practice her profession as an attorney at law. She is met by Jim Miller, the town judge, who tells her that the town is badly in need of a good lawyer. The cowboys, fascinated by Ruth's good looks, proceed to build her a house and an office. Tom Walton, the ranch foreman, falls in love with the beautiful woman-lawyer, and decides to get into trouble. He steals the sheriff's horse, and riding into town, shoots up the main street. He is arrested and thrown into jail. The day of Tom's trial arrives, and all the cowboys are on hand to hear Ruth defend him. While Ruth is pleading the case, she looks toward the door and there stands a well-dressed eastern fellow, who proves to be her husband. They rush into each other's arms and when the cowboys learn who the newcomer is, the court case is immediately suspended.",
