      "description": "To the Public Danger  is a 1948 British  drama film  directed by  Terence Fisher  and starring  Dermot Walsh ,  Susan Shaw  and  Barry Letts . It was made at  Highbury Studios  as a  second feature  for release by the  Rank Organisation .   Like other Highbury productions, it offered acting opportunities for several of Rank's young contract stars. The film's sets were designed by  Don Russell , although a number of the scenes were shot on location. It was based on a 1939 radio play by the writer  Patrick Hamilton , who had been encouraged to write the story as part of a government road safety campaign. Hamilton had himself been knocked down by a  drunk driver . The story was updated slightly, and represents the post-war malaise with the use of  noirish  sequences.   After making the film Fisher graduated to directing several more expensive productions for  Gainsborough Pictures .",
