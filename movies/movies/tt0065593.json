      "description": "Cromwell is a 1970 British historical drama film written and directed by Ken Hughes. It is based on the life of Oliver Cromwell, who rose to lead the Parliamentary forces during the later years of the English Civil War and, as Lord Protector, ruled Great Britain and Ireland in the 1650s. The film  follows Oliver Cromwell, portrayed by Richard Harris, as he becomes a key leader in the English Civil War against King Charles I, played by Alec Guinness. The film depicts Cromwell's rise from a reluctant politician to a military leader, ultimately leading to the king's trial and execution,  and Cromwell's subsequent role as Lord Protector of England.",
