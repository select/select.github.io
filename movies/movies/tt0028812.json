    "Plot": "Captain Jerry Crawford (Tom Keene) who, with his Mississippi Vollunteers, is stationed at Fort Escambria in 1817, is summoned to the aid of a frontier family which has suffered an attack at the hands of the warring Seminole Indians. While driving off the raiders, Jerry and his side-kick \"Kentuck\" (Budd Buster), come across a gun used by an Indian. It is of such quality that the soldiers suspect white renegades of supplying the weapons to the Seminoles. Bill Crawford (David Sharpe), Jerry's younger brother, while carrying a boatload of supplies and munitions to Fort Escambria, is stopped by Bill Holston (Robert Fiske), Provost Marshal for Don Salvador Dominguez (Carlos De Valdez'), in Florida, and his henchman Jenkins (Ray Bennett). Bill is tricked into crossing into Spanish territory while his cargo is seized. Bill is returned to Florida and sentenced to be shot at dawn.",
