      "description": "After a tough day on set, Hollywood golden boy River Phoenix hits L.A’s fashionable nightclub The Viper Room.  He’s looking forward to getting on stage and jamming with his friends.  This is a moment he’s been waiting for.  When the plan changes, a disappointed Phoenix ingests a lethal cocktail of drugs, staggers outside and collapses on the sidewalk.  Paramedics are unable to revive him and he dies shortly after.  Final 24 recreates River Phoenix’s last day to tell the tragic tale of a young man whose short life was dominated by the constant pressure to perform.\n\nSE1 EP03\n\nDirected by Mike Parkinson\n2006\nDave McRae\n\r\nMORE Popcornflix MOVIES, FREE on YouTube!\r\n\r\n Action: https://bit.ly/2XC8pvv\r\n Romance: https://bit.ly/2NVnIQ2\r\n Horror: https://bit.ly/2LeNNaK\r\n Crime: https://bit.ly/2NK201z\r\n Drama: https://bit.ly/2G6Uasy\r\n Comedy:  https://bit.ly/2LPCNQD\r\n Western: https://bit.ly/2S7FRc4\r\n Popcornflix Channel page: https://bit.ly/2Saak9p\r\n\r\nWatch more free movies and TV series at Popcornflix.com, or on the Popcornflix app available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Chromecast, and AppleTV.\r\n\r\n#Popcornflix, Full length free movies and TV series.\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Popcornflix\r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Popcornflixnews\r\nPopcornflix is owned/operated by Screen Media Ventures",
