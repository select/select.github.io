      "description": "Various video clips featuring Barbara Mandrell on steel guitar. Note: The live video performance of \"Kentucky Means Paradise\" was on YouTube at one time but as of the date of this writing it is no longer available. I have inserted an unrelated promotional picture of Barbara with audio from that performance which was taken from a TV show called, Melody Ranch . If someone has or can acquire that original video clip, please leave a comment and I will include the file in the playlist if you are kind enough to share it.
