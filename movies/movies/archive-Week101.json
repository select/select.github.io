      "description": "Hello and welcome back to another sick..err slick double bit of fun from your friends in the projection booth. Tonight, we are happy to present that father and son duo of fun frivolous film making - Arch Hall Sr. and Jr. First up, after some cunning coming attractions and a Tweety Bird cartoon, we bring you the pair's infamous 1962 creation \"Eegah\" starring Richard Kiel as a love sick caveman battling junior for the affection of Marilyn Manning. Then, following a brief intermission, we conclude the evening with the duo's 1964 comedy con-job, \"The Nasty Rabbit\", about a Russian plot to sneak a poisonous bunny into the USA. Not only does Arch Hall Sr. star in both films with his son, he co-wrote both as well, all in an effort to showcase the young man's talent. Needless to say, after one more film push by dad, 1965's \"Deadwood '76\", Junior left the big screen and became a successful airline pilot while Daddy finished out his career co-writing 1972's \"The Corpse Grinders\" ....  inspiring snack bar menus throughout the land!
