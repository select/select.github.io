    "Plot": "Kiko the Kangaroo takes his young charges onto the ice for the usual winter frolics in this latest iteration of a typical Terrytoon.Co-Directors Manny Davis and George Gordon do a typically fine job with this cartoon, which Terry had been producing variations on since the 1920s. There are some amusing gags; there are moments of beauty, mostly involving graceful moments; and there is an arc of increasingly frantic events, culminating in a chase that serves as a decent plot for such cartoons. The result is decent, but given that Terry redid this cartoon every couple of years, the incremental improvement does not overwhelm the seen-it-all-before factor.",
