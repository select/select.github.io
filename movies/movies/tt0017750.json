      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This crime dramedy is the first film adaptation of the 1926 play. It was adapted another two times, most famously in the 2002 Oscar-winning musical version. The picture follows a woman who murders the man she is having an affair with after an argument. While initially distraught at the idea of being convicted and receiving the death penalty, her lawyer convinces her that if she plays her cards right she can not only be acquitted, but be more famous than ever. This version was not a box office success, but modern viewers praise the satire and acting. ",
