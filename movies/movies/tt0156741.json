    "Plot": "A Los Angeles artist with everything seemingly going for him, suddenly finds a change in his life, when an art curator cancels his upcoming one-man show. His model girlfriend immediately leaves him. Forced to move back to his old job at a pizza parlor, and into a rundown tenement, where several oddballs wander the hall, including a lonely middle aged woman, who makes Spam casseroles for all the bachelors, a daffy prostitute, and a Spanish Don Juan, who wanders the halls in his bathrobe. Then, a young Colorado woman moves across the hall and things look up, until he learns that she has a total backwoods quality that he doesn't know how to handle. When he dumps her, the whole building turns on him.",
