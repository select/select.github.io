This is where the trouble commences. Jones' wife suddenly appears and accuses Jones of making love to the cook. Jones denies it. She scornfully points to the finger marks on Jones back. Jones still denies it. The wife becomes angry and seizes the pan of flour and turns it upside down on Jones' head, spoiling his best Sunday clothes. Jones escapes and cook is discharged. This is a very funny picture.\"",
