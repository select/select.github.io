      "description": "A self-employed long-distance trucker (Anthony Booth) meets a pretty woman (Jacqueline Ellis) at a roadside cafe and later offers her a lift, but then his valuable shipment of whiskey is hijacked. The trucker tries to determine how they knew he was going to take that particular road, while the hitchhiker thinks she knows a way to track down the boss hijacker (Derek Francis).. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
