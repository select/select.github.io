      "description": "During WWII, a radio reporter begins to suspect that a commentator at his station may be using her position to broadcast shipping information to enemy spies. With the help of the girl's sister, he sets out to expose the spy and her Nazi gang. Craig Stevens as Ward Prescott Irene Manning as Pam Mitchell Maris Wrixon as Sue Mitchell Tod Andrews as Gordon Morrel Peter Whitney as Zinner John Maxwell as Ernie Haskell William Forrest as Martin Oster Roland Drew as Nils Thorson I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
