    "Plot": "Farmer Al Falfa isn't impressed in the least by the scary show on the radio. When he and his dog go to bed after midnight, however, things definitely get scary in this good Terrytoon.Farmer Al had been a Paul Terry character from his second short in 1915 and he definitely gets a good, if generic workout in this cartoon. It looks like it had originally been planned for a Halloween cartoon, but scary cartoons were and remained a viable tradition for many years. Although there is little here that had not already been done and would not be done again -- the ending is a trope in itself dating from ALICE IN WONDERLAND -- it you have a taste for the black &amp; white antics of Terry's studio in this period, you'll enjoy this one.",
