Directed by: Rudolf Ising Actors: Production Company: Warner Bros. Release Date: 8 July 1933 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1 Baby central. A flock of storks is leaving with babies. An old man at a ledger book is dealing with phone calls and letters; a request for twins from Nanook of the North sends him to the refrigerator; the stork carries them in slings marked \"upper birth\" and \"lower birth.\" Another request, written in Hebrew; this baby comes back as a rough Jewish stereotype, and gets stamped kosher. He then joins the head man singing the title song, and shuffling us off to see the baby assembly line, manned by dwarves. The babies are washed in a washing machine, dried, powdered, diapered in paper towels, loaded up with milk, and sent off in a crib. They clamor for \"Cantor\" and one of the dwarves reveals that he was _Eddie Cantor_ in disguise, followed by another round of the title song.",
