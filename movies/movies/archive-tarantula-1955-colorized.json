      "description": "Strange deaths in the Arizona desert intrigue a local doctor (John Agar), who gets help from the new assistant (Mara Corday) to a professor (Leo G. Carroll) experimenting with giving growth hormones to animals to increase the world's food supply. John Agar as Dr. Matt Hastings Mara Corday as Stephanie 'Steve' Clayton Leo G. Carroll as Prof. Gerald Deemer Nestor Paiva as Sheriff Jack Andrews I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
