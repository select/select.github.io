    "Plot": "In the Republic of Utopia, because of the bad economic crisis ailing the nation, the Jews are made the scapegoats for the economic and social ills affecting the population; therefore, the government decides to expel them. Leo Strakosch is among the exiled. He is engaged to Counsellor's Linder's daughter. He gets into the Republic, in a clandestine way, to show to the society the wrongness of their anti-Semitic prejudice. Bettauer's novel differs essentially from the film version. \"Vienna\" was named \"Utopia\". Even a happy ending was provided.",
