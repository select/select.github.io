      "description": "Address Unknown is a 1944 American film noir drama film directed by William Cameron Menzies based on Kressmann Taylor 's novel Address Unknown (1938). The film tells the story of two families caught up in the rise of Nazism in Germany before the start of World War II . Cinematographer Rudolph Maté employed shadows, shapes and camera angles to create the imagery. One notable scene shows Martin Schulz ( Paul Lukas ) descending a staircase awaiting his arrest by the Gestapo, with the shadow of a web-like criss-cross of window panes behind him.",
