His other two sons, Ross and Adolphe, quarrel over an outstanding loan. Later that night, Adolphe is murdered and the police are called. Everyone is lying and has their reasons. A mysterious man is seen on the property before Grondel, the Butler, is killed. When the reporters arrive, they write wild stories as O'Leary looks for the killer with little help from Det. Jackson.
