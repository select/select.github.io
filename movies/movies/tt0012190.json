      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. One of the top grossing silent films ever made, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was also a critical darling on release. It was an important success not only for director Rex Ingram and star Rudolph Valentino, but also for writer June Mathis, one of the few female writers in Hollywood at the time. The film follows a young man and his family, split between both Germany and France, as world war I begins and ravages Europe.",
