      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. While The Crowd was a modest critical and commercial success on release, in modern reviews it is thought of as one of the most impactful and enduring silent films of all time. The story highlights a perfectly normal couple dealing with relatively ordinary problems, which was unusual for a film from this period. Unfortunately, realism in film was not popular during The Depression, as escapism became much more common for the time.",
