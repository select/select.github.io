      "description": "“Gripping mystery” “Interesting curio for soccer fans and vintage mystery lovers” “Amusing for dubious reasons” (IMDB reviews quotes). A unique mix of soccer, mystery and comedy. Leslie Banks stars at the head of a good British cast. Good production values. Some of the jargon may be difficult for US viewers to follow. Recommended for all those who insist soccer should be called football. IMDB rating 6.3. Directed by Thorold Dickinson. Released in 1939 (UK only). Complete print. TRIVIA: The Brentford Bees were the stand-ins for the fictional amateur team the Trojans. The war forced the cancellation of a planned sequel.",
