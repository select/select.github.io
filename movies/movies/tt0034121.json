    "Plot": "Stranded on an island after his ship was wrecked by a hurricane, Porky meets a friendly African Native. They build a house, and Porky begins to explore the island. On his way we see various sight gags. First, Porky finds a parrot that won't say, 'Polly wants a cracker' because he's waiting for the $64 question. We also see monkey's playing craps, and a monkey who can't seem to climb up a 'Slippery Elm.' Then, Porky sees animals crowded around a water cooler. Porky is then confronted by African Natives who chase him off the island. Porky escapes by chopping a motorboat out of a tree and drives away in it with his African friend. But when the Natives throw spears at the boat, Porky puts an American flag on the back of the boat, and the spears back off.",
