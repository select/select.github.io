      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first of his \"Ukraine Trilogy\", writer and director Alexander Dovzhenko felt that this movie was his most patriotic, though it's more avant-garde rather than propaganda. The picture occasionally makes it onto lists of greatest films of all time and is almost universally regarded as a classic. It follows an elderly Ukrainian man who is searching for a legendary treasure in the mountains as political revolution rages around him. ",
