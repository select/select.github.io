      "description": "The only PD episode of Burke's Law. Episode Title: \"Who Killed Jason Shaw\" S1 E15 This show was originally set to air on 22 November 1963. It was pushed back by the network's coverage of John F Kennedy's assassination. This film is in the public domain because its copyright was not renewed in 1991, which was the necessary time for any film with a date in notice of 1963.",
