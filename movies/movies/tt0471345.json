    "Plot": "A man at the front of the crowd doffs his tall silk hat and bows to the camera. The crowd of people present for the annual Egg Rolling Festival of Preston peer at the camera. They point at it, they smile at it, they leap up to be seen by it.... and doubtless bought tickets to see themselves in the theater.This was a specialty of Mitchell and Kenyon. They ran a film studio in Manchester that specialized in local sights -- although they would occasionally go outside the conurbation and sometimes even across the Irish Sea. Everyone seems to wear a hat in a Mitchell &amp; Kenyon movie and take great delight in their instant celebrity. It's a look into a different world, at once more foolish and better than the one we live in these days.",
