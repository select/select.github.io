      "description": "The film's script is based on A.P. Chekhov's story \"Ward No. 6\", but the film's action has been moved to the present time. Another innovation of the creators of the film is that the narration is conducted in the form of interviews with people, in a documentary manner. \n\nEvgeny Khobotov is the new head physician of a psychiatric hospital. He introduces us to Ivan Gromov, who has a persecution mania. It turns out that the previous chief physician, Dr. Ragin, considered him... a prophet. Now Ragin is in this hospital as a patient. But how did it happen that a healthy person, after communicating with a mentally ill person, loses his mind? How did he cross this line? And in general, isn’t the line between mentally ill people and normal people illusory? Perhaps it would be true to say that you and I all suffer from different forms of mental illness? One way or another, Dr. Ragin’s colleagues and relatives are trying to understand why the visit to ward No. 6 was fatal for the physician.\n\nYear of production: 2009\n\nDirectors: Shakhnazarov Karen, Gornovsky Alexander\nWriters: Alexander Borodyansky, Karen Shakhnazarov\nComposer: Evgeniy Kadimsky\nOperator: Kuznetsov Alexander\nProduction designer: Kusakova Lyudmila\n\nCast: Pankratov-Cherny Alexander, Ilyin Vladimir, Zharkov Alexey, Stychkin Evgeniy, Soloviev Victor, Vertkov Alexey, Evtushevskaya Albina, Kuznetsov Alexander",
