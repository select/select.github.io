    "Plot": "Aggravated by the meddling of Lucille Weymouth, her disapproving Park Avenue mother-in-law, Broadway actress Lola Allen quarrels with her weakling husband John. After reconciling with each other, the couple visits a nightclub, where a brawl breaks out and John is killed by \"Checkers\" Fraley, Lola's former underworld lover. During an acrimonious custody trial, Mrs. Weymouth testifies that John was about to separate from Lola before he was murdered, and this revelation convinces the judge to award Mrs. Weymouth complete custody of Lola's baby boy Tommy. Despondent, Lola, who is unable even to visit Tommy, finds work in a children's day nursery, which is run by the kindly Mrs. Warren. Five years later, Mrs. Weymouth dies, and a physician sends Tommy to Mrs. Warren's nursery under an assumed name. Unaware of his parentage, Tommy forms a close friendship with little Pat Collins, whose father Hugh, a widowed radio announcer, loves Lola but is unable to convince her to marry him. One day, Fraley, who has just escaped from prison, shows up at the nursery and, using threats of blackmail, forces Lola to hide him in the nursery attic. While playing, Tommy and Pat climb into the attic and are taken hostage by Fraley, who makes them stand over a trap door to prevent the police from shooting their way into the attic. Eventually, the children escape onto the sloping rooftop, where they are pursued by the gangster. During the chase, Fraley is shot and killed by the police. Tommy's identity then is revealed to Lola, and Pat blesses Lola and Hugh's union.",
