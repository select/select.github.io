      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This mystery picture was the first sound film by Pathé Exchange studios, and it seems to show. While a murder mystery aboard a ship might usually require a lot of dialogue, this film fills its runtime with as much talking as possible. Still, some critics viewed it as unique, and overall critical reception was positive at release.  As a side note, while I view this as the highest quality version of the film I could find, it does have a watermark in the bottom right corner throughout the film. I apologize for not being able to find another copy at higher quality, but hope that it doesn't detract too much from the picture. ",
