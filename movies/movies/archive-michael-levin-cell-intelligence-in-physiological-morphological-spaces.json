      "description": "Long before brains and nervous systems appeared, life was already solving problems in metabolic, genetic, physiological, and anatomical spaces. In this presentation, Levin will describe remarkable capabilities of cell groups as they create, repair, and remodel complex anatomies. Anatomical homeostasis reveals that groups of cells are collective intelligences; their cognitive medium is the same as that of the human mind: electrical signals propagating in cell networks. Levin will explain non-neural bioelectricity and the tools we use to track the basal cognition of cells and tissues and control their function for applications in regenerative medicine. The talk will conclude with a discussion of Levin's framework based on evolutionary scaling of intelligence by pivoting conserved mechanisms that allow agents, whether designed or evolved, to navigate complex problem spaces. **FAIR USE NOTICE** This content may contain Copyrighted (©) Material.
