This time--as a group of unsuspecting poachers find themselves in the mouth of madness, amid ravenous undead predators--the game ranger of a devastated wildlife preserve forms an uneasy alliance with the illegal hunters to stop the spreading of the virus. Now, the rabid four-legged zombies are out of the cage, and they crave human flesh; however, what started the madness?",
