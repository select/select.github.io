      "description": "Pickup is a 1951 American low-budget film noir starring Hugo Haas , Beverly Michaels , Allan Nixon and Howland Chamberlain . Written and directed by Haas, a Czech actor and filmmaker, it was his first American film behind the camera. Haas, a refugee from German-occupied Europe , went on to make a series of gloomy noirs about doomed middle-aged men led astray by younger femmes fatales .   The film is based on a 1926 novel, Guard No. 47 by Josef Kopta , and has a plot similar to the 1946 film The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), though with a much different ending.",
