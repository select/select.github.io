      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Frequently regarded as lead actor William S. Hart's finest film, Tumbleweeds finds a rough cowboy finally ready to settle down, only for his past to continue dragging him down. While the picture was mostly buried by the studio that released it, few silent westerns are considered superior.  I've included two versions of the film with slightly differing soundtracks and quality, as well as the prologue given by William S. Hart in the re-release.",
