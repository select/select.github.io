    "Plot": "Popeye, Olive (rowing), and Wimpy (eating) arrive in America by rowboat. Popeye builds a log cabin (by punching some trees) and sets off to gather some ducks. He fights a few indians along the way, but they pose no real threat. But meanwhile, back at the cabin, the indians have been sneaking up and have Olive and Wimpy under siege. Wimpy soon runs away, and runs into Popeye and the ducks he has collected, while Olive has been single-handedly fighting off an endless stream of indians. Popeye eats his spinach and makes short work of the remainder of the tribe, turning the leader into 'Mahatma Gandhi'.",
