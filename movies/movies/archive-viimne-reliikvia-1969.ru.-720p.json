      "description": "Viimne Reliikvia (The Last Relic) is an historical adventure film produced in the then Soviet-occupied Estonia in 1969.  It became one of the most popular films ever made in the country, and some critics have even called it \"the only Estonian cult film\".  The film is loosely based on Prince Gabriel or The Last Days of Pirita Monastery, a 1893 Estonian historical fiction novel by Eduard Bornhöhe. The film's content editor was later president of Estonia Lennart Meri.",
