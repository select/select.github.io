You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation       \"The Glorious Adventure\" is a British historical romantic drama and a swashbuckler directed by J. Stuart Blackton starring Diana Manners, Gerald Lawrence, Cecil Humphreys, Victor McLaglan, William Luff and many others. The events in the film occur during the reign of King Charles II of England.     \"The Glorious Adventure\" stands out from the ranks of silent films for being the first British all-color feature film, created with Prizma Natural Colors.  As a result the viewers can enjoy beautiful costumes and see a spectacular fire in color. The plot is very entertaining and the acting is first class.      This is the first of only two films with Diana Manners in a leading role, and the only one available, so this is the only star performance of this actress that can be seen today.   Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
