      "description": "subtitles are available off this site at http://www.archive.org/details/ScenesOfCityLife-SrtSubtitles A heavily didactic 1935 Shanghai movie which plays as a tragic comedy. A poor guy loves a girl but there's another man after her, and her father is also in the way. It starts out like Charlie Chaplin, but it goes on to show the basic moral failures of the Westernized capitalistic city. While it has its problems (one of the biggest being that it has two huge framing devices right at the beginning - it takes a few minutes before it really gets going) I consider this movie on par with \"The Goddess\", and one of the best mainland Chinese movies ever. It's my first time subtitling a Chinese movie, I'd appreciate any feedback. This work is dedicated to the Public Domain .",
