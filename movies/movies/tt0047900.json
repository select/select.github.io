      "description": "So what that it has nothing to do with Broadway. So what that the acting is awful and the production values nonexistent (except for Foley FX which consist of a cricket and a car horn). So what that it seems twice as long as it actually is. Because now you have a foolproof way to get rid of unwanted house guests. Just flip on this movie, and watch 'em scatter. A strong contender for the worst movie of all time. Written and directed by Phil Tucker. Released in 1955. a.k.a. \"Hollywood Jungle\" Tape-transferred complete print. NOTE: This flick would make a mind-boggling double feature with another Phil Tucker anti-classic, \"Dance Hall Racket,\" which is available here at IA.",

That backer proves to be George \"Georgie-boy\" Gomez, a local hood who, we discover, has stolen the money he's proposing to pay to Fletcher from Boss (uncredited), a vicious gangster. Georgie-boy's sole provision is that the movie should star Lena Little, an actress whose star has faded for all but a certain hood who will always carry a gun in his pocket for her.",
