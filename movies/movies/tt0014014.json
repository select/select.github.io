You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation   \"The Hell Ship\" is a drama created by director Victor Sjöström (Seastrom), a star of Silent Hall of Fame. The film features Jenny Hasselqvist, Matheson Lang, Victor Sjöström and others. Victor Sjöström was successful in his native Sweden before making a career in the USA in 1924-1930.  His Hollywood films are still copyrighted, this is why we show you a film from his previous years. \"The Hell Ship\" was the last film he made in his native country before starting a career in the USA. Perhaps this was the film that convinced Hollywood producers and directors to invite him, and that invitation paid off, because Victor Sjöström created a number of masterpieces in the years to come. A sailor's attempts to find work are unsuccessful for a long time. When he finally lands a job he discovers in horror that the ship's cargo is a mortal danger for everybody on board.   Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
