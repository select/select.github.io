Sensing the danger of re-assignment to less idyllic Navy bases, the crew of minesweeper Compton decides to prove that their work in the area is vital, thus leading to their continued presence on the island of Boonzey. But Captain Povey is no fool and he's determined to declare the entire crew of HMS Compton redundant. Commander Stanton and his Chief Petty Officer Banyard come up with a series of schemes designed to convince Captain Povey of HMS Compton's usefulness. These schemes include a live mine-sweep demonstration, using a fake mine, a fake outbreak of Yellow Fever, using the crew of HMS Compton and a local French Revolution against the British Rule on Boonzey, using some drunk French islanders.",
