    "Plot": "In the middle of the night, a tiptoeing tree knocks on a gravestone and wakes up three skeletons. A yowling black cat frightens them. The skeletons retaliate by throwing their skulls at the animal and breaking it into several smaller cats. It's time for the skeletons to frolic. They form an orchestra and play music. They dance. But they don't always get along. One skeleton loses its skull and makes several efforts to steal another skull from his fellow. Another pair enjoys dancing together, but one of them can't seem to remain intact. At five AM, a crowing rooster alerts the skeletons to the hour. In a panic they all rush back into their graves.",
