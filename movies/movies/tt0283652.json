    "Plot": "Lieutenant Casey Sheppard, US SEAL, (Michael Worth) takes exception to the useless brutality of his chief Frank Ratliffe (Damian Chapa), during a search and destroy mission. Later, back to their army base in Okinawa Island, Japan, it's obvious they are interested in Sensei Matsumura's (George Cheung) twin daughters, the daring Nikki (Karen Kim) and the coy Kamiko (Karen Kim in a double role). Frank goes on a date with Nikki and sometime later Casey finds her corpse, and sees Frank in the process of hiding evidence of a murder-for-rape crime. Three years later, Frank Ratliffe is a criminal operating from a former Russian island, who has turned against his own SEAL corps and about to kidnap Dr. Jane Burrows (Kate Connor), a physicist scientist, to force her help him getting two nuclear bombs ready for a strike against the United States. Backed by an army of dozens of killers, plus Sophia (Sophia Crawford), a sexy expert with the saber, and Borris (Velizar Binev) the scarf strangler, he asks for one billion dollars ransom for the bomb. His former commander Admiral (Burnell Tucker) forms a team of seven commandos, including retired SEALs like Frank's arch-rival Casey, Army Major Nathan Doner (Marshall R. Teague), and Kamiko who, reluctant at first, then accepts to help Casey in what is deemed to be a high risk, desperate mission against powerful, evil terrorists. After the invasion, as any explosives or gun shots would ignite the natural gas that contaminated the nuclear station, the seven commandos and the defending thugs are restricted to the use of crossbows, swords, daggers, iron chains, and hand-to-hand fighting techniques which in the end will prove to be as deadly as machine-guns. When action stops, it's a gory end for all, and a Pyrrhic victory for a few.",
