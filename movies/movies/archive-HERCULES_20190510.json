      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu with poster art and drive-in style audio. SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. But I've also upload the files outside the .zip so they can be watched here. This DVD contains the movies HERCULES & HERCULES UNCHAINED, along with the preview and intermission reels, laid out like and old drive-in show. These two movies were shown together back in the day.",
