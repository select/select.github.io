      "description": "Hell - Low and welcome back to everyone's favorite fixture for mayhem and murder. And, tonight, we hope we do not disappoint with a double dose of killers creeping around a couple of really big houses. First up, after a few coming attractions and a \"Snuffy Smith\" cartoon, we start things off with \"The Strangler Of Blackmoor Castle\", a German production about a hooded killer strangling and decapitating folks at an English estate while he looks for diamonds. Then, after a brief intermission, we finish things up with Del Tenney's \"Curse Of The Living Corpse\", a fun piece featuring Roy Scheider and a group of family members getting bumped off at a Connecticut estate. All in all, we hope they don't make too much of a mess... good maids are so hard to find and you can bet, the butler didn't do it... they were at the Snack Bar. Don't forget we now have an APP. It's not much, but you can check it out here: http://shockerdrivein.dx.am/appPage.html  or here: https://archive.org/details/app-debug_202002 Web Page:  http://shockerdrivein.dx.am Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/shockerdrivein.dx.am",
