      "description": "PizzaFLIX Presents CLASSIC MOVIE MONDAY\nStars: John Barrymore, Camilla Horn, Mona Rico\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\n🍕ORIGINAL SYNCRONIZED SCORE🍕\nReleased by United Artists and directed by Ernst Lubitsch, this sweeping 1929 romantic drama marks the final silent film appearance of screen legend John Barrymore. Set in the majestic Swiss Alps during the Napoleonic era, the story follows a tragic love triangle where passion and duty collide. Barrymore stars as Marcus, a rugged mountaineer whose heart belongs to Ciglia, played by the radiant Camilla Horn.\n\nWhen war and betrayal tear them apart, fate takes a dark turn, culminating in a haunting finale that showcases Lubitsch’s flair for emotional depth and visual storytelling. Camilla Horn, already acclaimed for her performance in Faust (1926), delivers a moving portrayal of a woman torn between love and sacrifice. Mona Rico and Hobart Bosworth add strong support to this tale of doomed romance and moral conflict.\n\nAre you a PizzaFLIX Fanatic?
