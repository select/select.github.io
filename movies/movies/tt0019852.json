Set in the majestic Swiss Alps during the Napoleonic era, the story follows a tragic love triangle where passion and duty collide. Barrymore stars as Marcus, a rugged mountaineer whose heart belongs to Ciglia, played by the radiant Camilla Horn.\n\nWhen war and betrayal tear them apart, fate takes a dark turn, culminating in a haunting finale that showcases Lubitsch’s flair for emotional depth and visual storytelling.
