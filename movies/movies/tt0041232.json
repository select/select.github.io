      "description": "After years of making mostly comedies and literary adaptations, Raffaello Matarazzo turned to melodrama with this intense tale of a tight-knit working-class family shattered by temptation. There’s a touch of noir in  Chains, in which the saintly yet earthy Yvonne Sanson, as the devoted wife of a mechanic (Amedeo Nazzari), finds herself unwillingly drawn back to an ex-love who has turned to crime.",

    "Plot": "This is a movie about suffocation. It is so like us to try to keep secrets when the truth will set us free. If we can bank on the sincerity of someone who loves us and confront the demon, we come out okay. What really happens is we begin to cover one thing up and then another and another and soon what would have had an easy but uncomfortable solution becomes something that drives your very existence. This reminded me of \"Cape Fear\" where, you pick it, DiNero or MItchum, begin their antics, seeing themselves as victimized and never recognizing what they have done. The greasy creep continues to stalk and intimidate, and because he has virtually no conscience, leaves a path through the lives of good people. This is a good movie, though it felt a bit unsatisfying to me. The performances are excellent and the camera is quite impressive. This is little known these days, but works pretty well.",
