    "Plot": "The Aesop fable of the Tortoise and the Hare is offered as a varsity track event in this Terrytoon from 1934.Although I usually try to rate and review Terrytoons on their own merits -- while freely admitting that in my view, they have few besides competence -- nonetheless, that is impossible in this case. I cannot look at a \"tortoise and hare\" cartoon without comparing it to the three produced half a dozen years later at Leon Schlesinger's studio. By that standard, this stinks.Is that fair? After all, those cartoons had Bugs Bunny and a staff of directors, writers and animators that has rarely been equaled.That, however, is precisely my point. It could be done and was done, and soon. It's just that it wasn't done here. Why should any of us be satisfied with something like this when we have the other?",
