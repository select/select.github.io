      "description": "Until recently the only other available versions seem to have been a poor Netflicks DVD sourced from VHS, and a badly faded broadcast print rip that may not have been complete. This version has 640 resolution but the print is in near-perfect condition.   “Riveting” “I didn’t want it to end” “Still good after 52 years” “Outstanding” (IMDB reviews quotes) There is dark intrigue in this international crime thriller with Dick Powell as a hard-nosed, globe-trotting Treasury agent on the trail of a large heroin shipment destined for the US. Good supporting cast and good production values. Compelling. Highly recommended. IMDB rating 7. Directed by Robert Stevenson. Released in 1948. Complete print. AKA “The Twenty Seventh Day”",
