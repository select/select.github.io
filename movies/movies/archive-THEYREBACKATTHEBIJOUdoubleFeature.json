      "description": "Those pesky undocumemted space aliens are again raising hell. This time it’s in Europe and the U.K. in this simulated second-run house double feature program. The mayhem begins with coming attractions and a cartoon followed by the killer plants from outer space in John Wyndham’s “The Day of the Triffids.” Next interstella migrants turn nice British scientists into nasties in “They Came from Beyond Space.” They're like from nowhere, man! CAST NOTE: If You were wondering what happened to Robert Hutton after “The Slime People,” now you know. https://archive.org/details/TheSlimePeopleTrailer2 ",
