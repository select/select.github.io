Sara, a former sweetheart of David's who has selfishly married for wealth, secretly determines to lure him from Marie. When forced to keep an overnight business engagement, Daly invites the Grahams to keep his wife company, and Sara writes David begging him to see her alone--but her letter is intercepted by Marie. When the Grahams accept the invitation, Marie confronts Sara with the unopened evidence. Discovering the plot, David denounces Mrs. Daly and reaffirms his love for Marie.",
