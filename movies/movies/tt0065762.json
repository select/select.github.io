      "description": "The Vampire Happening The more people hate and attack this film, the more I love it. Pia should have made at least a dozen sexy vampire films; she's a natural for the role, and Yvor Murillo served as a wonderful sidekick and straight man for all the farcical action and dialogue. Pia is an award-winning actress (Cannes - Best Actress - 1967) who suffered from bouts of anorexia and drug addiction and took some wrong turns in life and paid the price for it. I'd still let her bite me, though. Long Live Baroness Clarimonde Catani! If someone has access to the original German version of this film, let me know and I'll add that version to the playlist.  Enjoy the sexiest and most comical vampire film ever made.",
