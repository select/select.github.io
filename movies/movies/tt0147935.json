    "Plot": "While his boss goes into the store to do some shopping, she leaves the baby in a stroller outside -- that was considered normal back then -- with strict orders to the bulldog to make sure that nothing happens. Of course, as soon as she steps ito the store, random action makes the pram head off, with the dog in frantic pursuit.This Columbia cartoon was produced during the all-too-brief time when Frank Tashlin was in charge of the animation department and it shows his strong sense gag construction, including a thrill comedy sequence, and also his use of camera angles. There's a major point-of-view sequence that is a hallmark of Tashlin's cartoons; he was the most cinematic of the cartoon directors, when he wasn't directing the most cartoonish of live-action features.",
