      "description": "Radio star Jack Benny, intending to stay in New York for the summer, is forced by the needling of a rival to prove he is a real man by roughing it at a Nevada ranch. Meanwhile, singer Joan Cameron (Ellen Drew), with whom Jack is infatuated, is maneuvered by her sisters into performing at a dude ranch in the same Nevada town. To impress her, Jack pretends to be the owner of Andy Devine's ranch, and pays the ranch hands to stage a fake fight with him, unaware that two real outlaws are in town looking for trouble. Jack Benny as himself Ellen Drew as Joan Cameron Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson as Rochester Van Jones Andy Devine as himself Phil Harris as himself Dennis Day as himself Virginia Dale as Virginia Lillian Cornell as Peggy Theresa Harris as Josephine Kay Linaker as Brenda Tracy Ward Bond as First Outlaw Morris Ankrum as Second Outlaw I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",

Jack's losing battle to prove his manhood to Joan means broad slapstick burlesque of Western cliches.",
