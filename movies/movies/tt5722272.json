    "Plot": "Six novice riders-father, sons and friends-take on the Colorado backcountry on BMW F800GS adventure bikes to create a film about life, meaning and the longing to be part of something epic that is written on every human heart. John Eldredge, author of the New York Times best-seller Wild at Heart (4 million copies sold) and his three sons are joined by two friends for a thousand-mile ride through the best dual-sport tracks the Centennial State has to offer, serving up a thoughtful documentary on life's deepest questions. \"Everyone is looking for a story worth living,\" is the line that opens the film-an adventure narrative that captures the highs and lows of dual-sport riding, including a bone breaking crash on Engineer Pass. \"We set out to tell a story about story,\" Eldredge explains. \"Too many adventure films are high on great footage but desolate when it comes to content and meaning. You can only watch so many Red Bull adrenaline shots till you want something meatier-a film that talks about something worth hearing.\" From a cinematic point of view, A Story Worth Living is certainly a gorgeous \"best of Colorado\" feast with sumptuous footage ranging from the Sand Dunes through ranch country to the famous high backcountry Alpine Loop outside Ouray. Psychologist Dr. Dan Allender joins Eldredge (a counselor himself) to stir up reflective conversation on the story every individual lives, and the story we are all looking for.",
