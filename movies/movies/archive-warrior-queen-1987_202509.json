      "description": "In his relatively short life Chuck Vincent churned out a lot of movies. While they all were competent none of them were very good but many are bad movie classics. Roomates, That Lucky Stiff, Hot T-Shirts, Blue Summer are all teen formula movies that somehow manage to be quite entertaining.  Warrior Queen is a massive departure from his normal style. Also the movie is padded out with clips from other similar movies (possibly even Caligula) that are not matched well in terms of color or resolution.  He did manage to get a couple of name stars to show up. Sybil Danning and Donald Pleasence though to be fair those two rarely turned down a movie. Vincent staple Samantha Fox makes an appearance as well.  Someone spent some time restoring this movie as it looks great. ",
