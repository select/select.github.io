    "Plot": "The only review I can offer is based on the fragmentary version I watched on a DVD issued by RetroFlix. Poor picture quality, and nowhere near 70 minutes in length. The title character is called Jack, not Georgie Amberson Minafer as in the novel and in the 1942 Orson Welles film. Jack's childhood scenes (where he is purportedly portrayed by Ben Alexander, who later played Sgt. Friday's partner in the TV series \"Dragnet\") are absent from this DVD. Jack turns away Mr. Morgan, who is courting Jack's widowed mother Isabel. Isabel does not die of a broken heart in this version --- she is hospitalized due to a tenement fire, from which she is rescued by Mr. Morgan. Jack is also in the same hospital as a result of having been struck by an automobile. If Aunt Fanny is in this movie, she's not in the short fragmentary DVD I watched.",
