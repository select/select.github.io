      "description": "When a train mishap strands an American reporter (Paul Douglas) and an English photographer (Leslie Phillips) in a small Eastern European kingdom, they investigate the country's new leader (Walter Rilla) who turns out to be conducting gamma ray experiments on children in an attempt to increase their brain power. The two outsiders are aided by a woman (Eva Bartok) who works in the castle laboratory in hope of rescuing her little brother. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
