      "description": "Azar Shiva, veteran iranian actress (born 1940), living in Paris in her old age but still looking so fresh. God Bless Her. Azar Shiva (born 1940) is an Iranian film actress known for King of Hearts (1968), Yahgoot-e se cheshm (1970) and Gozasht (1962). Azar Shiva was born 1940 in Tehran. After receiving her high school diploma, she gets a job at Tehran Radio at the age of 18 and starts dubbing a year later. Her first cinematic appearance was in 1961, when she experiences standing in front of the camera for the first time in \"Ahange dehkadeh\", a movie by Majid Mohseni. She acted in 21 Iranian films in one decade, among other King of Hearts and Prostitute. During her film career, she has acted with actors such as Mohamad Ali Fardin, Nasser Malek Motiee, Reza Beyk Imanverdi and Behrouz Vossoughi. In 1971, at the height of her career, Azar Shiva said farewell to acting due to her alleged protest against the state of cinema in Iran at that time. Some consider the reason for this to be the corruption and vulgarity prevailing in the Iranian cinema of that era. Awards and honors - Winner of the award for the best female lead actress from the second Sepas Film Festival (1970) for her performance in Roospi (Prostitute). - Winner of the gold plaque for the best female actress from the Iranian Cinema Film Festival (1969) for her performance in Roospi (Prostitute). - She is the 12th film actress in the history of Iranian cinema (jointly with Fakhri Khorvash and Forouzan)",
