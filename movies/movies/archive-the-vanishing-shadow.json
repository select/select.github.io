      "description": "A young engineer (Onslow Stevens) and a professor (James Durkin) use a variety of amazing inventions (an invisibility vest, a ray gun and a robot) to fight back against the greedy businessman (Walter Miller) and his henchman (Richard Cramer) who hounded his father to death. These bad guys aren't after his inventions, but are simply trying to get their hands on the valuable shares of stock in the Tribune that he inherited. The inventor is helped by the businessman's daughter (Ada Ince), who has disavowed him. A 12-chapter science fiction cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
