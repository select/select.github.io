Harry Booker, who is Polly's father, receives word from the executor of his brother's estate that he is the heir. They move into a mansion where Polly and Murray are about to be married. Hamilton is a wedding guest. Before the ceremony, Murray's jealousy manifests itself and the two men quarrel. Summerville and Booker also get into the argument and a general melee follows. All kinds of handy ammunition is used in a running battle among the trees and shrubbery of the Booker estate. The final result of the dispute is Polly's refusal to wed Murray and her suggestion to Hamilton that she will back him in a new production if he will assign her to the leading woman's part. Polly appears at the theater and her inexperience causes many ludicrous situations. She ruins a scene and in the general disorder some inflammable material backstage catches fire. Murray grabs a hose and turns it on everybody. Polly is accidentally lifted with the curtain and falls from the top of the proscenium arch. A bomb is thrown on the stage and the explosion blows Hamilton, Murray and Slim out of sight. Hamilton leaves in disgust. Polly and Murray reunite.",
