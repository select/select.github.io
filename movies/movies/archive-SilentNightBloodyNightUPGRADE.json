Years later, Jeffrey needs some money and decides to sell the house, sending his lawyer to deal with the matter. The townspeople desperately want the house to be demolished and finally they’re given the out. While everyone is hoping for a White Christmas, an escaped mental patient from the loony bin stirs up a bit of a panic.
