      "description": "**This film is under license from Vision Films Inc. All rights reserved**\n\nStuck - A New York City subway train stops in the tunnel beneath the city with six complete strangers stuck inside the rear car. The strangers are a cross section of New Yorkers, of different race, culture and age. The emotions of the trapped, frustrated strangers explode, as the subway car becomes a kind of magical, musical, conduit cell. A place where strangers reveal through song more of themselves than any of them ever could have imagined.\n\nStarring - Giancarlo Esposito, Amy Madigan, Ashanti, Arden Cho, Omar Chaparro\n\n★ Awesome Movies \n\nWelcome to the Movie Central.
