      "description": "“Hollywood hooey from Gainsborough” “Mad, bad and wonderful” “Amiable tosh” “What a hoot!” (IMDB reviews quotes). A dashing young Englishman with amnesia (Granger) thinks he is a Spanish gypsy. A real Spanish gypsy (Kent) supports his delusion. Meanwhile back in jolly-old his newly-destitute fiancee (Crawford) is threatened by an evil suitor (Price). From this point you’re on your own. My work here is done. Kidding aside, don’t blame the direction, cast or production. All of which are okay. It’s just that this is the result when you adapt an absurd, Harlequin-style romance novel for the screen. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Arthur Crabtree. Released in 1946 (UK). Complete print.",
