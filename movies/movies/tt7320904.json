      "description": "Test filming with Eddie Constantine in Wiesbaden for the movie \"Tango through Germany\". For years I was looking for an actor who strives steadfastly afar. Someone who is not going for specific goal, but celebrates in a ritual way that it is about something that concerns everyone. Someone who makes a mark, provoking as a performance artist and takes the liberty to swim against the current. In April 1979, I found myself sitting next to Eddie Constantine. I told him about the project. He caught the idea and said, \" I'll make that for free; I 'll make you the Buster Keaton \". (LM)",
