      "description": "Title: Our Times - Roozegar-e Ma (documentary) (2002) Directed by: Rakhshan Bani Etemad Date of birth: 3 April 1954, Tehran, Iran Writing credits: Rakhshan Bani Etemad Year: 2002 Country: Iran Language: Farsi Color: Color Runtime: 75 min. Synopsis Roozegar-e Ma (2002) [shown in the US as Our Times], is a documentary by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, an extraordinary Iranian female director. Rakhshan Bani Etemad's documentary on the re-election of President Mohammad Khatami focuses on the numerous women candidates who put their name into the pool of 2002 presidential hopefuls. This movie gives us what appears to be an extremely honest view of two particular lives that inform us about Iranian culture, politics, and gender inequality. It's not an uplifting film, but it's definitely worth seeking out and watching. -- IMDb Cast: Pegah Ahangarani, Arezu Bayat, Alireza Davoudnejad, Ehsan Delaviz, Baran Kosari, Tala Porbaha, Milad Sadrameli",
