Things between them become complicated when Mundson (George Macready) is apparently killed, and Gilda inherits his estate. directed by Charles Vidor Rita Hayworth as Gilda Mundson Glenn Ford as Johnny Farrell George Macready as Ballin Mundson Joseph Calleia as Det. Maurice Obregon Steven Geray as Uncle Pio Joe Sawyer as Casey Gerald Mohr as Capt. Delgado I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
