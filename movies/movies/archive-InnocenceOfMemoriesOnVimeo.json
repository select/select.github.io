      "description": "THE MUSEUM OF INNOCENCE Director: Grant Gee Producers: Janine Marmot, Keith Griffiths Production companies: Hot Property, Illuminations Films Genre: CINEMA Length: 80 minutes Project status: Development “Orhan Pamuk has created what may be the single most powerfully beautiful, humane and affecting work of contemporary art anywhere in the world.\"      Simon Schama In the mid 1990's, Orhan Pamuk had an idea: to write a novel in the form of a museum catalogue, while simultaneously building the museum to which it referred. The plot of the novel would be reasonably straightforward: over many frustrating years, an unhappy lover (Kemal) contrives to steal a large number of objects belonging to his unattainable beloved (Fusun), after whose untimely death he proceeds to buy her family’s house and turn it into a museum dedicated to their affair.",
