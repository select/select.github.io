    "Plot": "Former British Army Colonel Harry Black comes to the rescue of an Indian village terrorized by a ferocious Bengal tiger. During the hunt, Black comes across the wife, Chris, of Desmond Tanner, who already knew Black from a German prisoner-of-war camp in World War II, where his cowardice during an escape cost Black his leg. Tanner now manages a tea plantation and wants to accompany Black on the hunt to impress his young son, Michael. Black still loves Chris, with whom he had a brief affair when visiting her to tell her about her husband's imprisonment, and Tanner senses this. Although neither man openly admits it, they compete for Chris' love. During the hunt, Tanner again shows himself a coward.",
