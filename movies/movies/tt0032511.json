      "description": "This wartime farce concerns the Crazy Gang who get involved in World War Two, which for them means running a fish and chips shop off a barrage balloon, floating accidentally into Germany, being interned in a concentration camp, acting as Hitler doubles and escaping. The Crazy Gang starred in something short of a dozen movies in the late 1930s and early 1940s, a sort of all-star supporting comics' series.",
