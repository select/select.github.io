    "Plot": "When Daddy takes up photography,he tries to take a picture of the bulldog, and asks him to strike a cute pose. This order offends the pugnacious beast, so he and his canine buddies take revenge.It's based on the 'Baby Snooks' radio skits of Fanny Brice. Indeed, you may notice that Sarah Berner's character bears that name; I would guess they got permission to put the characters into a cartoon, but the characters, which undoubtedly played beautifully on the radio, are less interesting as cartoons.",
