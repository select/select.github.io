      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. While this film was nominated for an Academy Award for best writing in 1930, it doesn't seem to have been well remembered beyond that fact. The only print available online is what appears to be a very poor quality VHS rip that is quite fuzzy. Modern viewers find the film good but not great, with a weak final act.",
