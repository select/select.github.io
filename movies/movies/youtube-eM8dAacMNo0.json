      "description": "Lady Lebanon tells her son, William, Lord Lebanon (Marius Goring) that he must marry his cousin Isla Crane to continue the family line. However, William has no intention of marrying Isla and matters are made more complicated due to Isla falling in love with an architect, Richard Ferraby , who has come to Mark’s priory to draw up renovation plans. At the same time the strange behavior of two footmen and the family physician add to the mystery surrounding the family. Eventually rumor and speculation lead to a murderous conclusion.\n\nColorized version https://youtu.be/b1_LSkFSJs8\n\n\nOriginal title: The Case of the Frightened Lady (1940) AKA: The Frightened Lady (1940)\n\nDirector: George King\nProducer: S.
