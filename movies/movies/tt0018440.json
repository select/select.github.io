      "title": "Spring Fever (1927) | Colorized Public Domain Romantic Comedy with William Haines & Joan Crawford",
      "description": "Spring Fever (1927) is a silent romantic comedy directed by Edward Sedgwick and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during Hollywood’s Golden Age of silent cinema. This restored and colorized edition of the public domain classic revives one of MGM’s breezy comedies of the Jazz Age, showcasing the playful charisma of William Haines and the early screen presence of Joan Crawford before she became one of Hollywood’s greatest icons.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe story follows Jack Kelly (William Haines), a brash and mischievous shipping clerk who unexpectedly finds himself drawn into the world of high-society golf. Determined to prove himself, Jack enters a championship tournament despite his lack of experience. There, he meets Allie Monte (Joan Crawford), a spirited young woman who quickly becomes his romantic interest.\n\nJack’s antics both on and off the golf course lead to comedic mishaps, misunderstandings, and clever reversals of fortune. With a mix of physical comedy and lighthearted romance, the film captures the clash between working-class ambition and aristocratic leisure culture. As the story unfolds, Jack’s determination and wit allow him to win more than just the tournament — he also wins Allie’s heart.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: Edward Sedgwick\n• Producer: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n• Cinematography: Clyde De Vinna\n• Editing: Sam Zimbalist\n\nStarring:\n• William Haines as Jack Kelly\n• Joan Crawford as Allie Monte\n• George K. Arthur as Tom\n• Edward Earle as William Monte\n• Jack Gardner as Dickie Long\n• Bert Roach as Al\n\nFilm Significance:\nSpring Fever is significant as an early romantic comedy pairing William Haines and Joan Crawford, two rising MGM stars of the 1920s. Haines was celebrated for his comedic timing and boyish charm, while Crawford, at this stage of her career, was transitioning from supporting roles to leading lady status.\n\nThe film is also a reflection of 1920s American culture, highlighting the popularity of golf among the wealthy elite and the comedic possibilities of class clashes. While not as remembered as Crawford’s later dramatic performances, this movie provides an entertaining glimpse of her early work and Haines’ dominance as one of the silent era’s top comedians.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This popular, but critically panned, golf comedy follows a young couple as they meet, fall in love, try to find out whether the other is a gold-digger, and whether or not their elopement marriage will survive past the week. Oh, and there is occasionally golfing as well.  The footage here is as clean as possible given how damaged the reels must have been. It remains eminently watchable.",
