      "description": "A callous gunslinger in the post-Civil War era, thanks to the steadfastness of a woman in a dictatorially oppressed city, discovers human emotions and rediscovers his conscience.   Dressed as a Western, this is a plea for civic integrity and the overcoming of racial prejudice. The staging is a bit brittle and not entirely convincing.",
