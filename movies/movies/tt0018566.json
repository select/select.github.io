      "description": "DVD remux of the 1927 Warner Bros. film \"When a Man Loves.\" IMDB TMDB Wikipedia When a Man Loves is a 1927 American synchronized sound historical drama film directed by Alan Crosland and produced and distributed by Warner Bros. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the Vitaphone sound-on-disc process. The picture stars John Barrymore and features Dolores Costello in the frequently filmed story of Abbe Prevost's 1731 novel Manon Lescaut. The lovers suffer, but the film has an optimistic ending, as they head to America. Manon dies at the end of the novel. The UK release title was His Lady. The film was the third feature from Warners to have a pre-recorded Vitaphone soundtrack.",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Only the third WB film to have an attached soundtrack, this historical action romance follows a religious knight who has forsaken the world, until he falls in love with a woman in trouble. It is based on a French novel from 1731 and was a hit with critics and audiences on release. Modern reviews are a little softer, but still find a lot to appreciate.",
