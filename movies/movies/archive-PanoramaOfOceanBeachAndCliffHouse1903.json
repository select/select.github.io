      "description": "A September 30, 1903 afternoon panoramic view, shot by H.J Miles, of people at the north end of Ocean Beach located near the Cliff House on San Francisco's western shore. The film is a production of the American Mutoscope & Biograph Company. If some of these scenes look familiar, it is because this is the full video from which 2 short clips, \"Cliff House from Ocean Beach\" and \"Crowds at Ocean Beach,\" housed at archive.org, were taken.",
