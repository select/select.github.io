      "description": "Noah's Ark is a 1928 American part-talkie epic disaster film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Dolores Costello and George O'Brien. In addition to sequences with audible dialogue or talking sequences, the film features a synchronized musical score and sound effects along with English intertitles.  The film intertwines two stories: the biblical tale of Noah and the Great Flood, and a contemporary narrative set during World War I. The film follows American playboy Travis and his friend Al as they navigate a train wreck and the war, while paralleling Noah's struggle to save his family and the faithful from divine wrath, culminating in the flood that destroys the wicked.",
