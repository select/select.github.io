      "description": "A scientist is murdered by foreign agents after having developed a powerful new explosive. The scientist's brother, an army corporal (Eric Linden), goes AWOL to discover the identities of the killers. Army intelligence officers are looking for him, as they believe he has a list of scientists who helped his brother develop the new weapon, putting them in danger. The spy ring is also after him, but they want the list for a different reason. With Ann Doran, Ben Alexander, Donald Curtis, Constance Worth. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
