      "description": "The Boy Who Stole a Million is a 1960 British comedy thriller film directed by Charles Crichton who called it \"pretty simple.\" The film was shot on location in the Spanish city of Valencia, with an international cast list. With multiple street locations it acts as an excellent showcase for the city and a good historical record of the city in the late 1950s (when filmed).",
