      "description": "The archangel, Eden, is sent to Earth where she is purposely placed with people who are about to make a life decision that could negatively impact them and others around them. On earth, Eden has not seen her brother, Lucifer who has been living on earth and causing havoc since God cast him out of heaven.  Lucifer adores his sister and wants to have the sacred relationship they once had and will do almost anything to get back into her good graces. Eden is Lucifer’s weakness. Eden loves her brother and desperately misses their bond but knows she can't yield to the darkness that he has become.  The struggle between her love for him and the darkness he represents creates an epic internal battle.\n2022.  Stars: Karen Abercrombie, Cameron Arnett, Kevin J.
