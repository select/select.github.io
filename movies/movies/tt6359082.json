    "Plot": "In Nazi Germany at the height of World War II, a ragtag group of American soldiers known as \"The Fearless Four\" are shipped off to a military prison for a variety of infractions, ranging from mutiny to murder. While they're being transported, Nazis attack the convoy, killing the MPs, but the rebellious American soldiers manage to escape. Travelling deep into rural Germany, the Americans stumble upon an SS experiment camp run by the notorious Doctor Mengele. They soon discover Mengele's diabolical plan to fuse human and animal DNA to create an unstoppable army of Werewolf soldiers. The Fearless Four are now the allied forces' only hope of preventing Hitler's Third Reich gaining the upper hand in the War. It's a fight to the death and only the most brutal and merciless will survive!",
