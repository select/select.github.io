      "description": "Revenge of the Zombies is a 1943 comedy horror film, directed by Steve Sekely, starring John Carradine and Gale Storm. The film was a follow up to the horror-comedy King of the Zombies (1941) with Mantan Moreland reprising his role as Jeff and Madame Sul-Te-Wan returning as a different character. The film is both a sequel and a partial remake of the original film. Both films feature the concept of a mad scientist married to a zombie wife. In this film, the female zombie has retained her free will, and refuses to be controlled. Plot: Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) returns to his childhood home in Louisiana after learning that his deceased sister, Lila (Veda Ann Borg), may have been poisoned. He brings a detective (Robert Lowery) with him, and they switch identities to protect Scott. At first, they find only Lila's sad husband, Dr. von Altermann (John Carradine). Secretly, however, von Altermann is a Nazi who has been perfecting a way to turn the dead, including Lila, into an army of zombies who will serve Hitler.",
