      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Thunderbolt was director Josef Von Sternberg's first sound film. It was described by a critic at the time as \"a musical comedy plot striving to masquerade as drama.\" While not a commercial success, it led to an Oscar nomination for lead actor George Bancroft, as well as critical praise for the direction.",
