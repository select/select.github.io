      "description": "Sort of a \"slice of life\" movie from the mid-1950's. Notable for being one of the films that was challenged by the New York Censorship Agency. The producers (or more likely the importers of the film) fought the ban and won but there were still two versions for a long time. The American Version, The Twilight Girls, featured less nudity and all of 13 year-old Catherine Deneuve's scenes were cut. No idea why, she was faking sleep walking to steal extra deserts. In this version, you'll notice the image quality shift which indicates inserts from the French version, Les Collegiennes. Also of note is this is Georgina Spelvin's first movie role. Even though she has a speaking role, she is not credited in the movie and appears last on IMDB's page.",
