    "Plot": "A Chicago gang led by scar-cheeked Slade (Dame Judith Anderson) carries out an audacious brokerage robbery. Lieutenant Bill Mason (Dennis O'Keefe) takes the case, continuing his friendly-enemy relationship with crime reporter Ann Rogers (Frances E. Neal). One gang member is caught; eventually, others follow. But Mason hasn't a clue to Slade, principally because he's unaware she's a woman. The plot periodically pauses for comic and romantic interludes.",
