      "description": "On a dark and stormy night, Krazy and his girlfriend seek shelter in an old abandoned house –- the domain of \"The Great Hindini.\" Completely bizarre goings-on ensue! Lots of weird concepts and surreal gags a la Fleischer Studios' \"Bimbo's Initiation\" - this is truly a nightmare-flavored cartoon that really pulls all the stops.
