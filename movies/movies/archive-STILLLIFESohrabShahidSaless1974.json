      "description": "Synopsis An old man and his wife have lived in a remote place for several years. He has been working for the railway company until once day he is replaced by a young lad. That is the end of everything for the old man. He has to leave his house and move to an unknown place. In par with the best Italian Neo-realist Masterpieces, this haunting film is a Chekovian tale of the wasted lives of a railway line-worker and his wife. The pace, the directing and the actings are so good that it will stay to haunt you for a long time, probably forever, once you have watched it. A masterpiece by any definition. -- IMDb Cast: Zadour Bonyadi ....
