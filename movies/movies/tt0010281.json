      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This picture follows a rambunctious young woman who is sent to a new home to settle down. Rather than do so, she dresses up as a man to escape to the night life of her new city. This romantic comedy is mostly known for the drunken kiss that is shared between what appears to be two men, though it turns out that one is just cross-dressing. Otherwise it is a simple but entertaining comedy from a prolific and distinguished director. ",

      "description": "A teenage tomboy, tired of being bossed around by her strict guardian, impersonates a man so she can have more fun. She quickly discovers that being the opposite sex isn’t as easy as she had hoped for. What ensues is a gender-bending comedy decades ahead of its time.",
