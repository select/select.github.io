      "description": "Title: Guernica (1950) Directed by: Alain Resnais Date of birth: 3 June 1922 Vannes, Morbihan, Bretagne, France Writing credits: Paul Éluard Music: Guy Bernard Year: 1950 Country: France Language: French Color: Black & White Runtime: 13 min. Synopsis On April 26 1937 the small Basque town of Guernica was bombed without warning by the German aviation. Two thousand people, all civilians, got killed. Like millions all over the world, Pablo Picasso was shocked and he translated his emotion into a magnificent but terrifying picture bearing the name of the martyred city. This film does not only comment on the painting, it also gives it a new life through frantic camera and sound effects. -- IMDb Cast: María Casares, Jacques Pruvost",
