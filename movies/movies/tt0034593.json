Gene Tierney as Miss Haoli Young George Montgomery as Johnny Williams Lynn Bari as Captain Fifi Victor McLaglen as Maj. Bull Weed Alan Baxter as Bill Jones Sig Ruman as Jarubi Myron McCormick as Shorty McGuire Robert Blake as Chandu Ann Pennington as Entertainer Philip Ahn as Dr. Young I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
