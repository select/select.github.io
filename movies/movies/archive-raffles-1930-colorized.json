      "description": "A distinguished English gentleman has led a secret life as the notorious jewel thief the press has dubbed \"The Amateur Cracksman\". But when he meets a woman and falls in love, he decides to retire from that life. Then an old friend comes to him with a predicament that entails him committing one last job. Ronald Colman as A.J. Raffles Kay Francis as Gwen David Torrence as Inspector McKenzie Frederick Kerr as Lord Harry Melrose Bramwell Fletcher as Bunny John Rogers as Crawshaw Wilson Benge as Barraclough Alison Skipworth as Lady Kitty Melrose I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
