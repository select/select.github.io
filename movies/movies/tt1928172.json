    "Plot": "Frontalwatte is like running against a wall and falling softly. Teenagers, Franz, Adrian and Anastasia stumble through a world without consequences. They pass the time with home visits, jaw surgeries, triangle lessons, incest and poetry slams. Their search for identity degenerates to the search for the right role. It is like standing on stage with bandages in the mouth. Franz is left by his girlfriend, Claire and is going around visiting luxury apartments as a potential buyer who is obviously not rich but lives in a city where this can still be pulled of: Berlin. He meets an older woman, Ursula who wants to seduce her teenage son, Adrian, but he refuses so she uses Franz to replace him for her sexual inappropriateness. One day they are caught by Adrian.",
