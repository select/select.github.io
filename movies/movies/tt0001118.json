      "description": "An Arcadian Maid was directed by D.W. Griffith in 1910. It stars Mary Pickford as a young poor girl who is lured to sin by an itinerant peddler played by Mack Sennett. It made me smile. While Pickford is playing her normal put upon innocent girl, Sennett seems to be playing it for comedy It is worth a watch. By the way, for those of you not familiar with the Griffith Biograph shorts, notice the circle with the AB inside it in the kitchen. Thus was the way the American Biograph company identified their films for protection from illegal showings. This film is available elsewhere on the Archive, but I have added a period sound track for enhanced viewing.",

He gives the naive girl an engagement ring and promises to marry her. When the peddler runs up some gambling debts, he visits the maid again and tells her they cannot marry until he has enough money to pay off his debt. While the farmer and his wife are asleep, the maid foolishly steals their money. The peddler takes the money and leaves on a train to get out of town. Overcome with guilt, the young maid runs away from the farm. Meanwhile the peddler gets into a fight and is thrown off the train. The maid stumbles upon him by the railroad tracks. She finds the money on the peddler and returns it to the farm couple before they even knew it was missing.",
