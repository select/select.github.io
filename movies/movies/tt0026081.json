      "description": "A primitive B-western that seems like it's older than it is. A lackluster cast and indifferent direction make it best suited for someone trying to cure insomnia. Filmed at Victorville, CA. The glitch-free print is in reasonably good condition. Directed by Victor Adamson (as Al James). US release 1935. UK release 1936. Complete print (TV edit).",
