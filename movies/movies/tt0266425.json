      "description": "“A true curiosity” (IMDB review quote). This crime melodrama is a fascinating example of how as late as 1930 some actors and directors were still learning to adapt to the medium of sound-film. It also is a good example of how a bad movie can be a lot of fun. Ned Sparks’ over-the-top performance as a crotchety old crime author steals the show. A remake of the 1914 silent “The Conspiracy.” IMDB rating 5.7. Directed by Christy Cabanne. Released in 1930. Complete print. AKA “Sensation” CAST NOTE: Bessie Love is also here at IA the restored version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Lost World” and the risque pre-code drama “Morals for Women.” https://archive.org/details/TheLostWorldCompleteVideoQualityUpgrade   https://archive.org/details/MoralsForWomen_452  ",
