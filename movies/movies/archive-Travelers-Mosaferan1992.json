      "description": "Synopsis A young woman's wedding becomes a ritual of mourning when her sister and family die in an auto accident on the way to the wedding. The sisters' mother refuses to accept her daughter's death, and in the midst of wedding guests and mourners, including the drivers of the truck that caused the accident, she orders the wedding to take place. But how can the daughter marry in the midst of a wake and without the family's traditional mirror, which the sister was bringing to the service? The film is transcendental in its resolution. -- IMDb Cast: Jamileh Sheykhi, Mozhdeh Shamsai, Majid Mozaffari, Fatemah Motamed-Aria, Farokhlagha Hushmand, Jamshid Esmailkhani, Mahbubeh Bayat, Hamid Amjad, Atila Pesiani, Enayat Bakhshi, Jahangir Forouhar, Homa Rusta, Esmaeel Poor Reza \"a brilliant exposition of the themes of death and predestinationâ¦[it] incorporates most of Beyzai's stylistic and thematic preoccupations--the alienated identity, theatrical setups, camerawork, sound effects, music, multiplicity of characters, time lapses, etc.--all brought together and unified into a homogeneous whole by the director's unfailing overall control\" -- International Film Guide",
