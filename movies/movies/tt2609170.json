      "description": "Bhranti Bilas  ( transl.  Comedy of Errors ) is a 1963  Bengali-language   comedy film  based on the 1869 play of the same name by  Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar ,   which is itself based on  William Shakespeare 's  The Comedy of Errors . The film was remade in  Bollywood  thrice as  Do Dooni Char  ,  Angoor  and  Cirkus . Although the original play was set in an unspecified, but distant past, the film relocates the story to modern day India. The film tells the story of a  Bengali  merchant from  Kolkata  and his servant who visit a small town for a business appointment, but, whilst there, are mistaken for a pair of locals, leading to much confusion.",
