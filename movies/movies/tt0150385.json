    "Plot": "Horrible cartoon, but thank goodness it's a short. The voices are ill-fitted and the animation is poor, though it does kind of resemble the style of Mad magazine back in the 60s. The one redeeming quality is that those familiar with \"Hong Kong Phooey\" will immediately recognize it as a springboard for that much funnier and much more entertaining series of the 1970s. The characters of Phooey and Rosemary the Telephone Operator are instantly transparent to viewers of the more recent series. James Hound, the hero in this short, is also a bumbling kung-fu artist like Phooey, and he receives messages from his boss via a tall, nasal-voiced woman very much like Rosemary. Saw this one at Library of Congress, so chances of seeing it elsewhere are probably slim.",
