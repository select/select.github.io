      "description": "http://imdb.com/title/tt0021764/ Chester Morris, college football hero, gets a job on Wall Street for Thelma Todd's father. Fed up with the cons and piracy of Wall Street, he goes into business for himself, highjacking rumrunners' ships bound to Prohibition America. Delightful film with lots of plot twists and turns. Director Roland West's last film, after which he planned to spend the rest of his life with the soon-to-be-murdered Todd.",

      "description": "Entertaining comedy-drama about a bored young stockbroker who decides to give it up and become a pirate. Stars a great cast for those who love early movies: Chester Morris ('Boston Blackie'), Thelma Todd (billed as 'Alison Loyd' here), Mayo Methot (ex-wife of Humphrey Bogart), delightfully grouchy Ned Sparks, and wonderfully silly William Austin. Includes what is probably Ned Sparks's only kissing scene! Colorized using DeOldify technology.
