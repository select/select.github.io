Mrs. Fielding, the mother of May, is deep in debt, and when Old Tackleton wants to marry her daughter she agrees, despite May's protest. Three years later Edward returns. At the King George Inn he learns that May is betrothed to Old Tackleton, which leaves him in deep despair. He decides to figure out if May really loves Tackleton. From a strolling actor he buys a false beard, a wig and some clothes. Disguised as an old man he visits his sister Dot, for whom he reveals his true identity. John Peerybingle realizes that it's just a disguise, but thinks the man behind it is his wife's secret lover, and plans to leave her. Meanwhile Dot tells Edward that May is going to marry Tackleton the same day, although she doesn't want to. Edward goes to May, carries her off, and marries her quickly. Tackleton gets furious at first, but is soon reconciled with all the others.",
