      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Its main claim to fame, that it was one of Bela Lugosi's early talkie films, The Thirteenth Chair is actually a remake of a film that was made in 1919 with the same name. Originally the lead role had been offered to Lon Chaney, which with both Lugosi and him would have made for very noteworthy casting. Reviews were solid, but not outstanding.  While this was the highest quality version I could find, it has a fairly poor preservation. ",
