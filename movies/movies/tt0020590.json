      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Director Dorothy Arzner was one of the few women directors working in Hollywood at the time of release, and was almost certainly the only lesbian director during that period. The Wild Party is the oldest work in her filmography that still exists and was a huge box office hit. While reviews were decent, this film about a college girl falling for a professor is more remembered now as the talking debut for star Clara Bow. ",
