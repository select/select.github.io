      "description": "Calling all armchair sleuths for the 2am Theater's presentation of this simulated Ginger Rogers/Lyle Talbot double feature mystery program at a second-run theater in the ‘30s. The mysterious mayhem begins with coming attractions and a Betty Boop cartoon. Then is Ginger Rogers the victim or the killer in “The Thirteenth Guest?” Lyle Talbot costars. The Intermission short is the mini-whodunit “The Wall Street Mystery” with Donald Meek. Then a body falling from a penthouse of death kicks off “A Shriek in the Night,” again with Rogers and Talbot.",
