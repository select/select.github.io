      "description": "If you like this movie and our channel, please subscribe: https://goo.gl/0qDmXe | On a Los Angeles street, Officer Hollis, a patrolman on his way home from work, stops a man he suspects of being a burglar and is shot and mortally wounded. The minor clues lead nowhere. Two police detectives, Sergeants Marty Brennan (Brady) and Chuck Jones (Cardwell), are assigned to catch the killer, Roy Morgan (Basehart), a brilliant mystery man with no known criminal past, who is hiding in a Hollywood bungalow and listening to police calls on his custom radio in an attempt to avoid capture. His only relationship is with his little dog.\n\nRoy consigns burgled electronic equipment to Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell), and on his fifth sale is nearly caught when he shows up to collect on his property. Reeves tells police that the suspect is a mystery man named Roy Martin. The case crosses the paths of Brennan and Jones, who stake out Reeves' office to arrest and question Roy. He suspects a trap, however, and in a brief shootout shoots and paralyzes Jones. Jones wounds Roy, who performs surgery on himself to remove the bullet and avoid going to a hospital, where his gunshot wound would be reported to the police.\nWith his knowledge of police procedures, Roy changes his modus operandi and becomes an armed robber. During one robbery he fires his semi-automatic pistol, and the police recover the ejected casing. Lee (Jack Webb), a forensics specialist, matches the ejector marks on the casing to those recovered in the killing of Officer Rawlins and the wounding of Sgt. Jones, connecting all three shootings to one suspect.\n\nCaptain Breen (Roy Roberts) uses this break to gather all of the witnesses to the robberies. They assist Lee in building a composite photo of the killer. Reeves then identifies Roy from the composite. However, Roy hides in Reeves' car and attempts to intimidate him into revealing details of the police investigation. He barely eludes a stakeout of Reeves' house.\nBecause the police do not realize that Roy has inside knowledge of their work, the case goes nowhere. Breen takes Brennan off the case in an attempt to shake him up. Jones convinces his partner to stop viewing the case personally and to use his head.\n\nPlodding, methodical follow-up by Brennan, using the composite photograph, results in information that Roy, whose actual name is Roy Morgan, worked for a local police department as a civilian radio dispatcher before being drafted into the Army. Brennan tracks him down through post office mail carriers and disguises himself as a milkman to get a close look at Morgan and his apartment.\n\nThe police surround and raid the apartment that night, but Morgan, forewarned by the barking of his dog, escapes through the attic and uses the Los Angeles sewer system as a means of escape. The film continues with a dragnet and chase through the sewers. Roy is finally cornered by the police in a passage blocked by the wheel of a police car. As the police shoot tear gas at Roy, he staggers and attempts to fire at them. He is then shot down and killed. The final scene is notable for its resemblance to the final scene in The Third Man in which Orson Welles is chased through the sewers of Vienna. No known connection between the films has been established.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Alfred L. Werker and Anthony Mann, produced by Bryan Foy and Robert Kane, story by Crane Wilbur, screenplay by John C. Higgins and Crane Wilbur, starring Richard Basehart as Roy Martin/Roy Morgan, Scott Brady as Sgt. Marty Brennan, Roy Roberts as Captain Breen, Whit Bissell as Paul Reeves an electronics dealer, James Cardwell as Sgt. Chuck Jones and Jack Webb as Lee.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"He Walked by Night\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.. 26 August 2013.

      "title": "He Walked by Night (1948) | Colorized Public Domain Film Noir Thriller with Richard Basehart",
      "description": "He Walked by Night (1948) is an American film noir crime thriller directed by Alfred L. Werker and Anthony Mann (uncredited) and starring Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, and Roy Roberts. This restored and colorized edition of the public domain classic breathes new life into one of the most influential crime dramas of the postwar era. Known for its stark realism, tense atmosphere, and semi-documentary style, the film is a chilling account of a cunning criminal who eludes the police across Los Angeles. By reviving this work in color, modern audiences in the United States, Europe, and beyond can rediscover its suspense and historical significance.\n\nPlot Summary:\nThe story is inspired by real-life criminal Erwin “Machine-Gun” Walker, a former World War II veteran who became a notorious burglar and murderer in Los Angeles. In the film, the character is represented by Roy Morgan (Richard Basehart), a cold and calculating electronics expert who uses his technical knowledge to commit burglaries and escape capture.\n\nWhen a routine stop leads to the shooting of a police officer, the LAPD launches a citywide manhunt. Detective Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) take the lead in investigating the case, while Lieutenant Harry Grant (Reed Hadley) provides voiceover narration in the style of a documentary, lending authenticity and a sense of urgency.\n\nRoy Morgan’s intelligence and resourcefulness allow him to stay one step ahead of law enforcement, as he modifies radios, creates makeshift hideouts, and maneuvers through Los Angeles’s underground drainage system. The film builds to a suspenseful climax in which police officers track him through the city’s storm drains in a visually striking sequence that influenced later films, including “The Third Man” (1949).\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Directors: Alfred L. Werker, Anthony Mann (uncredited)\n• Screenplay: John C. Higgins, Crane Wilbur\n• Cinematography: John Alton\n• Editing: Alfred DeGaetano\nStarring:\n• Richard Basehart as Roy Morgan\n• Scott Brady as Detective Marty Brennan\n• Roy Roberts as Captain Breen\n• Whit Bissell as Paul Reeves\n• Reed Hadley as Narrator\n• Jack Webb as Stammers\n\nFilm Significance:\nHe Walked by Night is considered a cornerstone of the film noir genre, notable for its gritty realism and atmospheric cinematography by John Alton, one of Hollywood’s great visual stylists. The film’s documentary-style narration and focus on police procedure helped inspire the creation of the long-running radio and television series “Dragnet,” in which Jack Webb (who also appears in the film) played the lead role.\n\nRichard Basehart’s chilling performance as Roy Morgan remains one of the most memorable portrayals of a noir antihero. The film’s stark use of shadows, tight framing, and innovative lighting showcase the artistry of Anthony Mann and John Alton, blending style with tension. Its climax in the Los Angeles storm drains remains one of the most iconic set pieces in film noir history.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, which means it is completely free of copyright restrictions and can be legally shared, viewed, studied, and preserved without limitation.
