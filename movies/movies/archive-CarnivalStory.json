      "description": "A young girl (Anne Baxter) runs away and joins with a travelling carnival troupe in Colonia (Germany),the American-owned circus in all its beautiful sadness in the setting. She is enamored by her employer (Steve Cochran) and is hired by the ringmaster (J.C.Flippen). Later she is contracted by a sault artist (Lyle Bettger),he teaches her the leap routine and soon becomes its main attraction but he has a somersault accident. Anne Baxter as an aerial acrobat dropping to swimming pool is interested in both men. The film is a melodramatic and romantic tale with the classic triangular love story through European tour meshing the drama with events offstage. The movie is wrought with romance and glamour but is a simple and tragic story of a scheming young girl and the men of whom she takes advantage.",
