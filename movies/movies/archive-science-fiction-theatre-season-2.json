      "description": "In this groundbreaking anthology series, host Truman Bradley introduces stories extrapolated from actual scientific data of the era. Episodes 1-13 of 39 in season 2. I colorized these using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.
