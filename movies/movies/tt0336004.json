      "description": "Baytekin Fezada Carpinsanlar is a Turkish sci-fi film from 1967. This is a very amusing and low-budget movie that's sure to please fans of cult, psychotronic or old Turkish films. This is a grand space opera whose laser beams are accomplished by scratching on the film with a pin, whose monsters are realized by covering extras in burlap sacks, where the illusion of two people talking to each other via view screen is pulled off by having the two parties stand on either side of a view screen shaped hole in the wall, and whose space-age sets appear to be a series of tiny storage rooms dressed with construction paper and fabric remnants. The hero sports what looks like outer space manboobs- I have no idea why. The space ships rival those in Plan 9 from Outer Space. It was directed by Sinasi Ozonuk, and stars Hasan Demirtag, Sevgi Can and Guner Celme. Happily, this film is in better condition than most old Turkish movies. It's in unsubtitled Turkish, but don't worry about that. Watch this if you're in the mood for something fun and crazy.",
