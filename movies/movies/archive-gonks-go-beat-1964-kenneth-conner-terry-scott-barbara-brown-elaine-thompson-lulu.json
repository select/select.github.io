      "description": "From Wikipedia: Gonks Go Beat is a 1964 British science fiction/musical fantasy film, directed by Robert Hartford-Davis, starring Kenneth Connor and Frank Thornton. It is loosely based on the Romeo and Juliet storyline and features 16 musical numbers performed by a variety of artists, including Lulu and The Luvvers, The Nashville Teens and the Graham Bond Organisation including Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and Dick Heckstall-Smith. The film includes an early appearance by the actor Derek Thompson performing with his twin sister Elaine. My Opinion: This is one of the best bad movies ever made. Clearly orchestrated by a bunch of guys in suits who wanted to cash in on the hipster movement. A clear example of why older people should not speak in modern slang.",
