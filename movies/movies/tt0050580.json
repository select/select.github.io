    "Plot": "Norman Hackett (Norman Wisdom) works in a jewellers workshop and fantasises (in the nicest way) about meeting the window dresser across the road from his workshop. He wants to buy her a diamond pendant but calculates it will take him over one hundred years to save up for it. He is talked into betting a pound on a six horse accumulator at the Goodwood races with a slightly shady bookmaker. When he has won on the first five races, the bookie owes him over sixteen thousand pounds sterling and everyone begins to worry. Everyone's future depends on a single race. What can be done?",
