      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. While generally thought of as one of director Oscar Micheaux's lesser films, The Girl from Chicago is also one of his earliest surviving sound pictures. Filmed with an all-black cast of non-professional actors, it follows a federal agent who falls in love with a girl in a lot of trouble. He attempts to get her out of it, but might find himself dragged in instead. ",
