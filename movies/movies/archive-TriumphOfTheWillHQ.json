      "description": "1935 directed by Leni Riefenstahl starring Adolph Hitler with star appearances by Herman Goering, Josef Goebbels, Max Amann, Martin Bormann, Walter Buch, Heinrich Himmler and thousands of adoring Germans. The Fuhrer decends from the clouds to bless the German people with several days of speeches and fanfare to celebrate the takeover of the Nazi death-cult. This copy has been sharpened a bit and the audio boosted in places. Sieg Heil, everybody!  (English subtitles are burned in),",
