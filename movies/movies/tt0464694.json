Thanhouser Company was created by Edwin Thanhouser in 1910.  It produced 1030 silent films (per IMDB). Tannhäuser (James Cruze) and Princess Elisabeth (Marguerite Snow) fall in love, but she is engaged to Wolfram (William Russell).  Then Tannhäuser is enchanted by the pagan goddess Venus (Florence La Badie).  Most of the film consists of extended religious episodes, which may or may not appeal to contemporary audiences. For this reason we offer you two versions: the first one is the whole film and the second one includes only the episodes with Florence La Badie. Let's all give our thanks to Ned Thanhouser for the outstanding work he has done for the past 25+ years in archives around the globe to acquire and publish on DVD and online Thanhouser films starring Florence La Badie.

    "Plot": "Elizabeth, niece of the Landgrave of Thuringion, a pretty prince who reigned during the middle ages, was noted for her beauty and goodness. In those days, when chivalry ruled the world, minstrels were held in high repute and great nobles sang to their lady loves and competed in minstrel tournaments for their favor. A minstrel tournament was held at the Landgrave's castle. There were many competitors, but all conceded that Wolfram, a young noble, would surely win the prize. And he would have succeeded if another contestant had not entered at the last moment, the young knight, Tannhauser, a stranger to the Thuringion court. Great as was Wolfram, Tannhauser was his master, and he received the laurel crown of victory from Elizabeth's fair hands. Love came to Elizabeth and Tannhauser, but the Landgrave had other plans for her, and betrothed his niece to Wolfram. Tannhauser, broken-hearted, wandered away from court. In the forests he met the pagan goddess, Venus, who ruled in her dominion beneath the earth. She cast a spell over the young knight and conducted him to her kingdom, where for a year he lived, charming Venus and her nymphs by his wonderful singing. Finally he grew weary of the life, prayed Heaven for forgiveness, and in a moment found himself in the forest which he had left a year before. Tannhauser made his way back to the court, where he found that Wolfram, discovering that Elizabeth loved Tannhauser, had freed her from the betrothal. Arrangements were made for the early marriage of the two lovers when Tannhauser, under the magic influence of Venus, praised her in song, and was accused of blasphemy. The only way that he could secure pardon was to journey to Rome with a band of pilgrims and implore forgiveness from the Pope. The Pope was a kindly man, but when he heard the sin of which Tannhauser was guilty, he wrathfully refused absolution, declaring that not until his staff should bloom would Tannhauser's lost soul be saved. Tannhauser, heart-broken, fled into the wilderness. News was brought to Elizabeth of Tannhauser's plight. She fell ill, but constantly prayed for him, and a miracle was wrought, for leaves appeared upon the Pope's staff. He recalled his words and sent a messenger to find Tannhauser and deliver his pardon to him, Tannhauser was found, and joyfully hastened to Elizabeth with the news. His joy changed to sorrow when he arrived at the castle and found that Elizabeth had died, praying to the last for him. Overcome by grief, the minstrel knight fell lifeless beside the body of his loved one.",
