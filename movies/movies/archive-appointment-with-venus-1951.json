Valentine Moreland Glynis Johns as Nicola Fallaize George Coulouris as Capt. Weiss Barry Jones as Provost Kenneth More as Lionel Fallaize Noel Purcell as Trawler Langley Bernard Lee as Brigadier I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural.
