      "description": "MN3428c Navy // Gene Kelly directs and stars in this wartime naval \"training\" film. Kelly plays the role of Seaman Bob Lucas, a troubled and angry \"fireman\" whose ship was sunk in battle. Many sailors died at sea, but Lucas lived through it and suffers from what now might be termed \"post-traumatic stress disorder.\" After lashing out at everyone around him, Lucas comes to understand his emotions, and moves from illness to wellness, with the help of a wise psychiatrist. Kelly considered his performance in Combat Fatigue Irritability one of his very best. But no filmography lists it. Apart from the combat-fatigued sailors for whom the film was made, few people have ever had the chance to see it. With this release it becomes accessible to Kelly's devoted fans and a wider public.",
