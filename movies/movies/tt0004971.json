Meanwhile, Mr. Walrus' neighbor, Mr. Spegle, takes a chance on the raffle and loses, but cheats his competitor, a foreigner, from the prize, which is a turkey. Because of the wrath he is receiving from Mrs. Walrus for no turkey, Mr. Walrus goes to any length to get a bird for dinner. So when Mr. Walrus sees that Mr. Spegle has roasted a turkey for dinner, he can't resist the opportunity to steal it. But some unexpected dinner guests and the wrath of the foreigner end up making the dinner party a commotion filled one for all.",
