      "description": "Built to Kill is an edgy, hyper-stylish horror anthology about people pushed, pulled, and driven to kill. An abused wife tends to the post-robbery wounds of her criminal ex-husband, when they are visited by a mysterious - and malevolent - preacher. A teenage girl lost in life finds belonging in a cult that brings out her darkest side. A man trapped in a deadly loop must lure another victim to buy his freedom. Two sisters must find a way forward and an unspeakable act is the only way to rid them of their abusive father. And a young woman buys her way, with flesh and blood, into a secret society. \n2020.
