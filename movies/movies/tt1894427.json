    "Plot": "Charles C. Peterson endeavors to entertain the ladies and gentlemen of the audience in the scientific art of billiards. That's what he says, and he proceeds to do so.... endeavoring, that is. I've played a little pool in my time, so I can see that some of the shots he takes are difficult, but he fails an awful lot in some of the shots that seem obscure to me.The camerawork on this is good. It's mostly shot in medium closeup while he's talking, but when he's taing a shot, and while the balls are in motion, the camera shifts to a high location looking down: not an overhead shot, but one that lets you see what is happening.",
