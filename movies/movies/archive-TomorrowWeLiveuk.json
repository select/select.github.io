      "description": "A Worthy wartime dramatic thriller of the underground resistance in German-occupied France. Screenplay by Anatole de Grunwald adapted from a story by Dorothy Hope supposedly based on a real event, but take this wartime claim with a grain of salt.. Good cast. Good production. Good print. Directed by George King. Released in 1943 (UK & US). Complete print (original UK version). a.k.a. \"At Dawn We Die\" (US). NOTE: Not to be confused with the US film \"Tomorrow We Live,\" a 1942 gangster western starring Jean Parker and Ricardo Cortez. It's available here at IA in the Feature Films Collection. CAST NOTE: Herbert Lom (German NCO) would later become famous for his recurring role as the eternally frustrated Chief Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther comedies.",
