      "description": "A man stands in front of a backdrop painted with a nature scene. From a fan, he conjures a costume, then a woman appears inside it. An assistant carries in a mannequin; they dress her and she suddenly comes alive. The magic continues: footmen bring in a sedan chair. He covers two seated women with scarves; when he removes the scarves, the women have traded places. The women, the magician, his assistant, and the footmen continue to appear and disappear, changing places and costumes. Then they all disappear, one into another. It's time for a curtain call. Director: Georges Méliès Stars: Georges Méliès Also Known As (AKA) La chaise à porteur enchantée France (original title) Az elvarázsolt hintó Hungary The Enchanted Sedan Chair USA",
