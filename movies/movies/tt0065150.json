      "description": "Northerner John Wayne befriends Southern Colonel Rock Hudson . Two high-ranking Civil War veterans, one a former general in the Confederate army, the other a commander in the Union army, become unbiased friends through shared dangers in revolutionary Mexico. A lavish, expertly crafted Western with tendentious patriotic tones, restorative notions of authority, and a simple glorification of militarism.",
