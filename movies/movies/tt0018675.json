    "Plot": "Mickey comes in his horse and buggy to pick up Minnie for the barn dance, but he's aced out by his rival, Pete, with a car, until the car breaks down. At the dance hall, Mickey dances on Minnie's feet. She rejects him to dance with Pete, until Mickey puts a helium balloon in his pants, thus making him light on his feet. Pete figures it out, punctures the balloon, and takes over, making this a rare cartoon where Pete wins.",
