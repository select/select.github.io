      "description": "“Solid wartime entertainment” “An interesting flag-waver” “Rousing wartime film” (IMDB reviews quotes). British propaganda piece and home front morale-booster mostly about the Nazi invasion and occupation of Norway. The history is accurate but the plot is far-fetched. Outstanding cast and excellent production. Good quality print. IMDB rating 6.1. Directed by Harold French. Released in 1942. Complete print. A.K.A. “The Avengers”",
