      "description": "Adventure Drama, the last film by John Ford Around 1935: Mongolian hordes attack an American lay mission in the Chinese border region, killing and burning. This Western, set in China, is John Ford 's last, and unfortunately less than laudable, feature film: a torso of slanted moral criticism, routine, and willingness to compromise. Anne Bancroft is impressive as a sporty, fearless, and cynical doctor - a positive contrast to the frustrated Puritan women and Asian \"subhumans.\"",
