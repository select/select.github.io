After being fired by his father, arguing with his girlfriend in front of their daughter, and then a visit to the local pub, Eli decides to get out of town. On a lonely mountain highway Eli misses a turn and careens over an embankment, landing deep in the forest.\n\nStars  - John Lewis, Graham Greene, Sherry Morris\n\n★ Awesome Movies \n\nWelcome to the Movie Central.
