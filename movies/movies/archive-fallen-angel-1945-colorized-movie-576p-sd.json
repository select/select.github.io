      "description": "Fallen Angel is a 1945 American film noir directed by Otto Preminger and produced by 20th Century Fox , with cinematography by Joseph LaShelle , who had also worked with Preminger on Laura a year before. Adapted from Marty Holland 's novel, the film was shot in various California locations and features Alice Faye , Dana Andrews , and Linda Darnell in leading roles. Andrews was cast under pressure despite initial objections to the script. Faye returned from a hiatus to accept the role but withdrew from the industry for sixteen years, until State Fair (1962), after her part was substantially cut during editing. Darnell, cast as the femme fatale , was praised for her performance, marking the beginning of several collaborations with Preminger, despite reported tensions on set. Fallen Angel was released to positive reviews from critics.",
