      "description": "A Chinese 1934 B&W movie, generally considered a classic of pre-war Chinese films. Also known as Ruan Lingyu's second-to-last film, with a plot that foreshadowed her own death. This movie shows the hard life of an ambitious young woman in 1930s Shanghai. There is a more thorough plot synopsis on Wikipedia . The movie is a talkie, that was also intended to be shown at theaters not set up for sound. The effect, frankly, is really weird.",
