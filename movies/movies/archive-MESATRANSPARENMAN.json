      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD: Features a custom menu with either poster art or still photo from one of the movies. Burning directions are real easy. Download the zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This disc features MESA OF LOST WOMEN & THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN, along with preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show.",
