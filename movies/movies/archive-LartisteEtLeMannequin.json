      "description": "Star Film Catalogue No. 284 L'Artiste et le Mannequin (The Artist and the Dummy) Director: Georges Méliès Writer: Georges Méliès Country: France Release Date: April 1903 (USA) AKA: The Artist and the Dummy Sound Mix: Silent Color: Black and White A very simple gag film as a young lady substitutes herself for a dummy in order to play a practical joke on an artist, this one-minute film could have been made by almost anyone at this point of time - and it was made, in varying forms, by several people. Nonetheless, and not simply because it was done by Georges Méliès, it does have a couple of interesting points. One is the later standard silent film trope that because the film is silent, the world inside the frame is likewise silent. The young woman manages to move the mannequin, which is as large as she is and substitute herself in its place without making any noise to alert the object of her practical joke. - 3 December 2010 | by boblipton (New York City)",
