      "description": "Alcohol problems have ended the career of criminal defense attorney James P. Curtayne (Spencer Tracy). Only when John O'Hara (James Arness), the son of friends, is suspected of murder, does he return to the bar. But a fateful mistake by Curtayne leads to O'Hara's conviction. Convinced of his client's innocence, he decides to search for the murderer on his own... In addition to Spencer Tracy's performance, the expressive black-and-white photography of John Alton (Academy Award for \"An American in Paris\") is particularly impressive.",
