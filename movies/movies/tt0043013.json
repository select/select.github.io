Outlaw Kid Wichita (Robert Preston), another Cloud brother, comes to town to offer his services. After catching some local ra nchers messing around with Tom's cattle, he steals the men's saddles. From there, things deteriorate into kidnapping, gang wars and murder, and the line between hero and villain becomes blurred.",
