      "description": "Legendarily awful girly exploitation flick. Cheesier than a Wisconsin dairy products expo. Features no one you will want to see again, except for the moose. So there are moose in Africa. Who knew? Yes there's a guy in a gorilla suit, but he only appears briefly to pickup his date. (Not to be confused with the \"The Wild Women of Wongo\"). Directed by Norman Dawn. Released in 1951. Complete print",
