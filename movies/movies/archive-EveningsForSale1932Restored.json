      "description": "The impoverished Count von Degenthal (Herbert Marshall) contemplates suicide, until he attends a masked ball, meets a beautiful American (Sari Maritza), and gets a job as a gigolo.  He charms an older woman (Mary Boland), but ends up in a romantic triangle.  The romance combined with his courtly honesty cause entanglements and even results in a duel.  This pre-code movie is quite nice. The credited cast: Herbert Marshall Sari Maritza Charlie Ruggles Mary Boland George Barbier Bert Roach Lucien Littlefield Clay Clement Arnold Korff Director: Stuart Walker Restoration by: J. Clement",
