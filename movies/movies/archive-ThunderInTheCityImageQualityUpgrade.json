      "description": "This glitch-free print is much sharper and clearer than the existing IA copy. Plus it is in the correct aspect ratio. Blimps and baronets in a British A-feature comedy with strong production values and a Capraesque conclusion. Its outstanding cast is led by Edward G Robinson. Directed by Marion Gering. Released in 1937. Complete print (re-release) TRIVIA: First telecast 7/31/44 on WNBT New York City. CAST NOTES: Distinguished British character actress of stage and screen, Constance Collier, is also here at IA in the romantic comety \"Half a Sinner.\" Sir Ralph Richardson is also here in the tongue-in-cheek adventure \"Q-Planes\" and H G Wells' science fiction epic \"Things to Come.\"",
