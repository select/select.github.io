      "description": "Three women from a beauty pageant are murdered so the organizers move the show to a cruise ship named Emerald Seas. Rather than sending a female cop along, the local police decide to send a male cop in drag. You'll know which one he is as he has chin stubble and always looks like he needs a shave. The movie does give Roberts Blossom a good chance to show off his rather dated wardrobe. IMDB shows Great Masquerade while the movie itself has a title screen of Murder on the Emerald Seas.",
