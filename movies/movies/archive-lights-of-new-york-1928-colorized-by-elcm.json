      "description": "This movie became Public Domain on 1 January 2024. Lights Of New York was the first 'Talkie' movie. The Jazz Singer, 1927, was part talkie, part silent, but this was the first to be fully voiced throughout. Fun movie starring Cullen Landis and Eugene Palette as a couple of small-town barbers who unwittingly find that their shop is a front for gangsters. Colorized using DeOldify technology.

My colorized movies are freely uploaded for free personal use only. Please don't put them on your own YouTube channel and monetize them. The one exception is Lost n Found Films on YouTube, who I authorise to use my colorizations. Thanks.)",
