      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Japanese experimental horror film was thought to be lost for 45 years before being found in a storehouse in 1971. It takes place in a mental institution and shows the delirium of the many patients, as well as how it seems to be affecting the elderly janitor who works there. The film was a collaboration with many writers but one of those writers, Yasunari Kawabata, was eventually awarded the Nobel prize for literature. ",

      "description": "A Page of Madness is a 1926 Japanese silent experimental horror film directed by Teinosuke Kinugasa. Lost for 45 years until it was rediscovered by Kinugasa in his storehouse in 1971, the film is the product of an avant-garde group of artists in Japan known as the Shinkankakuha who tried to overcome naturalistic representation. The film is set in a mental institution in contemporary Japan. Yasunari Kawabata, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, was credited on the film with the original story. Wikipedia The film  follows an elderly janitor at a mental asylum who takes the job to be near his wife, a patient suffering from severe mental illness. As he attempts to rescue her from the institution, his plans lead to chaos and tragedy, reflecting themes of madness, regret, and the impact of his past decisions on their family.",
