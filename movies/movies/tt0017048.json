      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Japanese experimental horror film was thought to be lost for 45 years before being found in a storehouse in 1971. It takes place in a mental institution and shows the delirium of the many patients, as well as how it seems to be affecting the elderly janitor who works there. The film was a collaboration with many writers but one of those writers, Yasunari Kawabata, was eventually awarded the Nobel prize for literature. ",
