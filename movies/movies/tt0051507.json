      "description": "“Not without its amusements” “Rather engaging” “Curse of the lifeless script” “Rubble without a cause” (IMDB reviews quotes). A petrified gladiator and undying lust in a modern version of the traditional mummy horror. It isn’t atmospheric nor is it very frightening, but the cast is adequate and so are the production values, plus it’s nice seeing Adele Mara again. Recommended for a rainy Saturday when your yacht is in dry dock . IMDB rating 4.9. Directed by Edward l Cahn. Released in 1958. Complete print.",
