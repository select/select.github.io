      "description": "\"Modesty should sue\" \"Travesty Blaise\" \"Great spoof, lame adaptation\" (IMDB reviews quotes) Yet another '60s secret agent spoof. This one is based on the comic book character created by Peter O'Donnell. Italian actress Monica Vitti is in the title role supported by an Anglo-Canadian cast. Haven't seen it. IMDB rating 5.2, MPAA unrated. NOTE: Two more films based on the same character were independently made, \"Modesty Blaise\" (1982) and \"My Name is Modesty\" (2002), which aren't sequels.",
