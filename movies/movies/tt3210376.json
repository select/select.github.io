    "Plot": "Co-workers at a high-profile Pet Supplies in Washington D.C., Pat and Maya couldn't be more opposite. This becomes evident when they are assigned to travel across country in an RV with the companies most prized possession, Scoots, on a social media tour right before Christmas! Maya works in accounting... she's a driven, ambitious businesswoman looking to turn her job into a great career. He's in the design department and basically plays for a living, which is a perfect job for the little kid who never really grew up. She wears Manolos. He wears Velcro. When Maya's obscenely successful boyfriend, Davis, leaves her right before Christmas, she begrudgingly decides to volunteer on the RV tour along with Pat and Scoots! At first, the road trip is a match made in hell. But the whole idea is the brain child of the company founder Max who is Pat's Dad. Once on the road, opposites are put to the test. Pat eats nothing but junk food, but she wants to be healthy. He listens to hard rock, while she prefers jazz. He drives 95, while she coasts at a leisurely 55. She thinks he's an uneducated man-child while he thinks she's a self-absorbed snob.",
