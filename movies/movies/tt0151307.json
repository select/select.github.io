    "Plot": "The storks are delivering babies, lots of babies, hordes of babies and the would-be parents are hiding; one of these unwanted children gets involved in a fairy tale in this mildly bizarre offering from the Paul Terry studio.Given the usual Terrytoon aiming-at-small-children techniques, this one sends an odd and mixed message: don't be born if you can't pay your own way immediately. The gags are decent, as most of the ones under Frank Moser's direction are, but given the retreat from a more adult approach the previous year, Terry's output for the first half of 1934 seems a bit perfunctory. Moser had been working in animation since Raoul Barre, directing cartoons since 1919. Like a lot of creative people, he still knew how to tell a story but directing two dozen every year was taking a toll.",
