    "Plot": "This early sound Terrytoon is given a slight Dutch varnish, mostly in the form of dancing windmills which wear wooden shoes and a dike busting, which causes the contents of a fishpond to cascade down a high cliff -- rather silly and wrong, but a child's idea of what Holland is like.This run-of-the-mill Moser cartoon has well-timed, if rather bland gags filling out an \"ugly duckling\" story in which the latest pup in a litter is kicked out by papa and succors a young Dutch girl The animation is competent, although not particularly compelling, as the style of animation begins to shift from the\"rubber tube\" animation which was so typical of this era of animation. This piece is not bad, but not really worth your time.",
