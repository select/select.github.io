    "Plot": "Collier, ordinarily a meek husband, is tired and tries to sleep overtime after a big night, but his wife, Blanche Payson, a husky Amazon, lifts him out of bed, carries him to the bathroom and throws him into the tub. When he finally appears at breakfast he finds his brother-in-law, Joseph Belmont, is being helped to the best of everything. In disgust he hastens to the office which he shares with his wife's brother. At the office Mae Busch, his stenographer, expresses a longing for an automobile. Collier agrees to buy her one and is accepting her loving thanks when Joseph appears. Quietly he lifts the telephone receiver from the hook, calls the wife on another wire and switches it to Collier's phone so that all the conversation which goes on between employer and stenographer can be heard at the other end. This brings wife and mother-in-law on the run to the office. They arrive just as the new auto is about to start on a test run with Collier and Miss Busch. To appease her wrath Collier gives the machine to his wife and while she and her mother speed away he and the stenographer hasten to a café. Joseph, who has joined the motor party, takes his mother and sister to this same café. Numerous complications follow but all ends happily.",
