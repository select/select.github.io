    "Plot": "This is a pretty good Farmer Alfalfa movie in which a cat in a battered top hat -- probably meant to suggest Ted Lewis -- courts the Farmer's cat, by singing her a ballad specially written for the cartoon -- called \"Agnes\".The cartoon quickly becomes a story of their elopement and it's mostly well done, with a few oddities -- Alfalfa's farm is right by the tenements and also the woods; and there's one incredibly bad patch of animation when the two cats are walking down the aisle. On the other hand, it's well backgrounded, the gags are good and even the typical Terry cheapness works well as a gag -- the cats flee from the shotgun-wielding farmer by running their mass entrance into the scene backwards.AGiven that the pluses outweigh the minuses, this is a pretty good Farmer Alfalfa.",
