      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Buster Keaton's third starring role in a talkie, this comedy is about a woman who refuses to marry unless her unpredictable older sister marries first. Through a misunderstanding, the younger sister eventually finds a timid man who she believes is a quiet Casanova for her sister to marry. While not one of Keaton's most beloved films, critics still found this to be a entertaining distraction. ",
