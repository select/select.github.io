    "Plot": "Bumptious objects to the price asked for repapering the pretty little parlor in his home, and decides that the operation is so simple that any child ought to be able to perform it and that consequently it will be an easy trick for him. The picture shows his reaching this decision, his selecting the wallpaper at the store and then the beginning of the difficulties. Rolls of wallpaper are hard things to carry, and when he finally does get them home he finds that the making of the paste is an operation which causes some trouble in addition to its practical difficulties. He tries to soothe the injured feelings of the cook with a kiss and thereby creates another injured feeling in his wife, who happens to enter at the psychological moment. And then the real fun begins, for Bumptious' management of the paste brush and paste proves disastrous to the parlor furniture, the curtains and floors, as well as to the wall he is trying to decorate. He does get one piece of paper up, but it is pretty crooked, which fact promptly starts an argument. He appeals to one of his friends, who is brought in by the wife to see the operation, and by making the appeal loses his balance from the ton of the ladder, with the result that the wife and the friend and Bumptious himself are deluged with paste when he falls, and the whole room is made to look as if a cyclone had struck it. The last scene of this uproarious story shows the \"easiest way.\" and with some very effective trick work brings a final laugh to close the picture with.",
