    "Plot": "A tour of the Azusa Zoo, whose only apparent employee is Porky Pig. We open with several sight gags: a Missing Lynx, the Tortoise and his Hair, and a Bum Steer. Next, three wolves: Timber, Gray, and Hollywood. Porky feeds the giraffe by sending a bucket of food up a carnival ring-the-bell contraption. A rabbit shows off his cotton tail; some March Hares march by. The running gag: A lion, pacing, looking for something. Amid many other spot gags, Porky tries to feed the seals something other than the mountain trout they require, and is met by a \"no substitutions\" sign; he also uses a stick to find the only sensitive spot on a hippo. Some WWII gags: A rabbit, surrounded by his huge family, is dismayed by a government order to increase production 100%; a panther finishes his meal and puts the bowl on a scrap aluminum pile. The payoff of the running gag: An ice cream man arrives, and the lion signals it over, but he's not interested in the ice cream just its delivery man.",
