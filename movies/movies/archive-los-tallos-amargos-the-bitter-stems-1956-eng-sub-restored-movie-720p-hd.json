      "description": "The Bitter Stems ( Spanish : Los Tallos Amargos ) is a 1956 Argentine film noir directed by Fernando Ayala . It is considered one of the last films of the Golden Age of Argentine Cinema . The screenplay, written by Sergio Leonardo , is based on the novel Los Tallos Amargos by Adolfo Jasca . The film's music was composed by Astor Piazzolla . The film was considered lost until it turned up in a private collection in 2014. A 35mm version was subsequently restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive , with funding provided by the Film Noir Foundation and Hollywood Foreign Press Association 's Charitable Trust, and premiered in January 2016 at the Noir City Film Festival, before playing in February 2016 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. When the film played at the TCM Classic Film Festival in Hollywood later that year, the presenter noted that while the 35mm negative was rediscovered, the soundtrack remained lost, so the restoration used the track from the director's 16mm print.",
