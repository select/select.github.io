      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features custom menu with poster art or still photo overlayed with a drive-in style audio. Burning is real easy. Just download the zipped folder, open it and extract the VIDEO TS folder. Now you grab a blank disc and burn, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded  the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This one another Roger Corman double-bill (and there's gonna be more, just lettin' you know), this time it's THE BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE & A BUCKET OF BLOOD, with previews and intermission show as well.",
