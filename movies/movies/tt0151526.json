      "description": "Mr. Magoo brings in his mail opening up a flyer for a store's \"83rd Anniversary Sale\". Magoo thinks that the flyer is a letter from his mother about her \"83rd birthday\" and begins to worry that maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his mother lately. He goes to pay his mother a visit to make up for lost time but upon arriving, Mother Magoo doesn't quite appreciate Magoo's attempts at being helpful such as baking a feather duster thinking it to be a turkey dinner. So she uses psychology to eventually persuade him to go back home (at least until next year). Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/meet-mother-magoo-1956/",
