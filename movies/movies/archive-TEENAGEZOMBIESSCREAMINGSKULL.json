      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with either poster art or a stills photo from one of the movies overlayed with drive-in style audio. Burning the disc is real easy: Download the zipped folder, open it and extract the VIDEO TS folder.   Grab a blank DVD and burn the VIDEO TS folder onto it, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD features a double-bill of TEENAGE ZOMBIES & THE SCREAMING SKULL, plus the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show.",
