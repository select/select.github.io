      "description": "DANGER AFLOAT! ABOVE, BELOW AND ACROSS THE SEAS...WITH THE HEROIC MEN OF THE COAST GUARD! On hearing of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a hobo decides to join the Coast Guard under an assumed name -- because he deserted the Navy years before due to gambling debts. What follows is a combination of melodrama and suspense, as he gets tangled up in the lives of another military family, succumbs once again to his gambling addiction, and risks his life defusing Japanese-laid mines off the California coast. Low-budget but somewhat satisfying (and dark) tale of fear and redemption.",
