    "Plot": "It looks like all the mice are away and it's the cats' turn to play in this Scrappy cartoon from the twisted mind of Dick Huemer. All the tomcats in the neighborhood come calling on Scrappy's cat, until it becomes an out-of-control party. Huemer and assistant Sid Marcus -- who would take over the series later that year -- seem to pull every cat gag out of their bag of tricks -- although the copy I looked at ran a trifle short and cut off in the middle of an extended gag. Alas. I suspect I missed a minute of Huemer insanity.Huemer's Scrappy cartoons tended to sag after the first half, but this one keeps going up. Either they had no end of good gags or, I suspect, they loaded the low-cost stuff into the beginning, which begins with a clever looping sequence of a tomcat rambling over a series of back fences yowling in search of his love.",
