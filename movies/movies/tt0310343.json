    "Plot": "I just saw the 8:22 minute section of this film called \"The Scenic 'Midland Trial [sic]', Route 60\" shown on TCM in their Treasures of American Archives series.  Reverend Snodgrass filmed this when U.S. Route 60 was just completed in 1929.  He takes us from one end (Ohio) to the other (Virginia), stopping along the way to point out gorgeous scenery and other West Virginia items which would interest any tourist.  So it was basically a well photographed and well titled travelogue.  As an amateur photographer myself, I loved it. He starts out with a full-frame map of West Virginia and I was somewhat disappointed he never made use of that map again.  It would have been nice to show where on the map he was as he got there.  I had to get out my Rand-McNally map to locate the places.  Still, it was great to get a record of 1929 West Virginia, with its rather sparse traffic and those square-looking automobiles.",
