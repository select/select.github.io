      "description": "Very enjoyable” “Fine home front spy mystery” “Delightful film” (IMDB reviews quotes). NOTE: This print is sharper, cleaner and with better contrast and brightness than the existing IA copy. The green cast of the IA print has been eliminated, and this print is in the standard MPEG4 (MP4) format. It’s spy versus spy in this seriocomic espionage thriller in which ordinary British village folk are up against a nest of Nazi agents. Excellent cast and good production values. Highly recommended suspenseful fun. IMDB rating 6.8. Directed by Anthony Asquith. Released in 1941 (UK). Complete print. AKA “Stolen Bombsight”. CAST NOTE: George Cole’s feature film debut.",
