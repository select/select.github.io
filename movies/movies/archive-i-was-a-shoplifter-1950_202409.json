      "description": "I Was A Shoplifter is a 1950 American  film noir   crime film  directed by  Charles Lamont  and starring  Scott Brady  and  Mona Freeman . Police detective Sergeant Jeff Andrews is working on a case involving a gang of shoplifters, and he allows himself to be falsely arrested as a petty thief in order to make contact with the gang. Meanwhile, Faye Burton, a petty shoplifter and the daughter of a prominent judge, is blackmailed by the gang into joining them on the promise that they will retrieve a confession signed when she was caught by a department-store detective who had her sign the document rather than calling the police.",
