    "Plot": "Houseflies open a window and fly to the local cabaret, which has been made from a coffeepot. There's good music and good dancing; but everyone is terrified when a monstrous spider walks in. He performs a song, then kidnaps a girl housefly. He takes her to his secret lair, followed closely by a mob of houseflies from the club. He quickly mixes a potion, drinks it and transforms into a respectable-looking spider in formal dress. When the houseflies bust in, they are confused. But the girl identifies him as the fiend. Suddenly the potion wears off and the flies see the beast for who he is.",
