    "Plot": "A lisping moppet floods his bedroom so he and his adorable, rag-eared pet dog can dream of ice skating with all his toys in this insanely cute Charles Mintz cartoon.Mintz artists were going through a phase of making cartoons aimed at unadulterated, sappy sentimentality. Sometimes they worked brilliantly in THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL. This one makes me want to turn axe murderer. Between its mauve decade style of character design and its bookend with a mother who, having to wade through shin-high water, seems more amused than worried about destruction and expense, I wonder what sort of idiotic people this was meant to appeal to. Not for anyone who might ever have to live in the real world or associate with people who do.",
