      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This Chinese romantic tragedy follows a woman from childhood up until old age as she grapples with whether to fulfill herself by being with the person she loves, or fulfill her duty to her family by marrying a wealthier man. This film was thought lost for decades before a full print was found in the 1990's. ",
