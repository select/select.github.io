      "description": "Susanne Bier's 'Better World' wins Oscar In A Better World, directed by Susan Bier wins the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar A Danish film has won the Oscar for best film in a foreign language for only the third time in the history of the awards. Susanne Bierâs âHÃ¦vnenâ (âIn a Better Worldâ) upset the even-money favourite, the Mexican/Spanish entry âBiutifulâ, to cap a fantastic double following on from its triumph in the Golden Globes in January. Referring to her statuette backstage, the filmâs director Bier, whose 2006 film âAfter the Weddingâ was also Oscar-nominated, said: \"I didnât know it would be this huge!\" Bierâs rehearsed winnerâs speech at the Golden Globes didnât go according to plan, and this time she took a different approach. âI had my speech ready but I didnât say one sentence from it!â she revealed. âHÃ¦vnenâ, which will be released in the US on April 1 by Sony Classics, is the third Danish film to win the award, following on from âBabetteâs Feastâ (1987) and âPelle the Conquerorâ (1988). -- The Copenhagen Post Synopsis Few directors have addressed the issues of the past decade as courageously as Denmarkâs Susanne Bier. With the much celebrated Brothers, she raised troubling questions about the First Worldâs relationship with the Third. After the Wedding pursued this subject further, contrasting the conflicting demands of the domestic and the societal. Her latest, In a Better World, explores similar terrain while offering a devastating critique of masculinity. In a war-torn African nation, physician Anton (Everlasting Momentsâs Mikael Persbrandt) confronts a steady stream of tragedy and loss. Much of what he faces can be traced back to a vicious and sadistic local warlord. Back home in Denmark, his estranged wife, Marianne (Trine Dyrholm), is concerned about their eldest son, Elias, who is picked on mercilessly by the class bully, Sofus. When new kid Christian arrives in class, he and Elias bond over a mutual hatred of Sofus. Surly and vicious since the loss of his mother, Christian is hardening into a rigid and ferocious manifestation of masculinity. His heartbroken father, Claus (Ulrich Thomsen), is finding it impossible to cope with Christianâs behaviour. The volatile situation is exacerbated by Antonâs return home and by an encounter between Anton, Elias, Christian and a violent, bullying mechanic (_Pusher_âs Kim Bodnia). At the heart of the film is the issue of male responsibility, specifically what it means to stand up for yourself and others. Troubled and confused by what he faced in Africa, Anton has no credible response to Christianâs demand that he answer the mechanicâs abusive behaviour in kind. The painful, dangerous rift between Christian and Claus, and the growing distance between Elias and his distracted parents, only makes the situation worse. Left alone to solve their problems, Elias and Christian grow even closer. As their clandestine acts of vengeance become more drastic, the film builds to an almost unbearable intensity. Far more than a mere exercise in suspense, the film raises essential questions about a world that has grown increasingly complex. âTIFF Cast: Mikael Persbrandt, Trine Dyrholm, Ulrich Thomsen, Markus Rygaard, William JÃ¸hnk Nielsen, Bodil JÃ¸rgensen, Kim Bodnia, Martin Buch, Toke Lars Bjarke, Anette StÃ¸velbÃ¦k Toronto (Special Presentations), Abu Dhabi (Narrative Competition), SÃ£o Paulo (International Perspective), Sundance (Spotlight)",
