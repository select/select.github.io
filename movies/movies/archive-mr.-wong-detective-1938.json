      "description": "When a chemical manufacturer is killed after asking detective James Wong to help him, Wong investigates this and two subsequent murders. He uncovers an international spy ring hoping to steal the formula for a poison gas being developed by the first victim's company. Boris Karloff as James Lee Wong Grant Withers as Police Captain Sam Street Maxine Jennings as Myra Ross Evelyn Brent as Olga Petroff George Lloyd as Devlin Lucien Prival as Anton Mohl John St. Polis as Carl Roemer William Gould as Theodore Meisle Hooper Atchley as Christian Wilk John Hamilton as Simon Dayton I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
