      "description": "This is Lamont Cranston, aka The Shadow; and he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men. This is a GOOD Shadow movie; although he doesn't seem to have the power to \"cloud mens' minds.\" The print is in good shape. It stars Kane Richmond and Barbara Read. More information can be found on IMDB The source for this upload can be found elsewhere on archive.org. I cleaned up the audio and decided to share it back to this site.",
