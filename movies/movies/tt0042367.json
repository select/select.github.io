      "description": "Cyrano de Bergerac is a 1950 American adventure comedy film based on the 1897 French alexandrine drama Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand. It  follows the story of a talented poet and swordsman, Cyrano, who is deeply in love with his beautiful cousin Roxane but feels unworthy due to his large nose. To help her pursue another man, Christian, who lacks eloquence, Cyrano secretly writes love letters for him, leading to a complex love triangle filled with wit, bravery, and ultimately tragedy. The film  stars José Ferrer as Cyrano, Mala Powers as Roxane, and William Prince as Christian de Neuvillette. Other notable cast members include Morris Carnovsky as Le Bret and Ralph Clanton as Comte de Guiche.",
