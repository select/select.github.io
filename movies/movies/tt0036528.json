    "Plot": "Freddy Martin and his band go on a trailer vacation, taking along Rochester as a handy man. They run out of gas in a ghost town and have to spend the night in the deserted Palace Hotel. The next morning, Ann Crawford and her three friends, Josie, Billie and May, arrive as Ann has inherited the hotel and most of the surrounding property, and she and her friends have pooled their savings to pay off the debts and formed a company to run the hotel. Jimmie Ross, singer with the band, decides to help the girls and has the hotel done over at his expense. Rochester, digging in the Victory Garden he has started, finds a gold nugget and the rush is on. Gangster Pete Hartley and his henchmen move in with intentions of taking over. He succeeds, over Ann's protests, in buying the property from her friends. Jimmie returns and thinks Ann has double-crossed him and they quarrel and part. Jimmie discovers that Rochester's gold nugget was his own gold inlay. Later, back on the radio with Freddie's band, Jimmie sings a song especially to Ann, who he hopes is listening.",
