      "description": "When reformed thief Boston Blackie is framed for a murder on an ocean liner docking in New York, the trail to exonerate himself leads to Coney Island and a spy ring. The first of 14 \"Boston Blackie\" films released between 1941 and 1949. Chester Morris as Horatio \"Boston Blackie\" Black Rochelle Hudson as Cecelia Bradley Richard Lane as Inspector Faraday Charles Wagenheim as The Runt Constance Worth as Marilyn Howard James Seay as the Mechanical Man I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
