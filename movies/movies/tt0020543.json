      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Lead actor Paul Muni received a Best Actor nod for this film, in addition to the picture being nominated for Best Writing. While it didn't win either award, this mystery drama examining a man on death row still makes for an intriguing watch.",
