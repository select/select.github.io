    "Plot": "Reporter Terry Brewer goes to the Los Angeles airport to say goodbye to his sweetheart, airline hostess Rita Moore. He notices G-Man Mike Phelan among the passengers and assuming Phelan is on the trail of a criminal, decides to go along to get a story. When the plane makes a stop in New Mexico, passenger Mrs. Tristo buys a hunting knife from an Indian. Late that night, a shadowy figure approaches the sleeping Ramon Duval and plunges a knife into his heart. Phelan assumes charge of the situation and begins to question the passengers. Wanda Terrell, who is wanted-fugitive Killer Madsen in drag disguise, holds up Phelan and announces he is now running the show. He orders pilot Bob White to head the plane to Evansville, Indiana, Masden's hometown. When Rita offers Masden a cup of coffee, which includes a powerful sleeping potion, the suspicious Masden exchanges cups with co-pilot Johnnie Martin who passes out. The annoyed Masden knocks out pilot White and Rita is forced to take over the controls. A heavy dust storm (thanks to Fred Jackman's visual effects) has clogged the plane's motors, but White comes to in time to bring the plane to a landing in the worst of the storm area. The passengers and crew all take refuge in a farm house, still held captive by Masden. The fugitive forces White and Terry to go with him to repair the plane, but Rita has gotten a shotgun from the farmer and follows them.",
