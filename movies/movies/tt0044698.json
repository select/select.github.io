      "description": "It's FRIDAY @PizzaFLIX \nStars: Sterling Hayden, Ward Bond, James Arness\nDirector: Charles Marquis Warren\n\nAn innocent man is sentenced to a Hellgate, an inescapable prison built into caverns below New Mexico's rugged, scorched desert. Watch Hollywood tough guy Sterling Hayden in his most visceral and brutal role. With Ward Bond as the vicious, vengeful warden and the always bad-to-bone Robert J. Wilkie.  This is hard time and not for the faint of heart.\n\nTRIVIA: This post-Civil War yarn was strongly influenced by the story of Dr. Mudd (the physician who attended John Wilkes Booth,) which was adapted into the 1936 movie The Prisoner of Shark Island.",
