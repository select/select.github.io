      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with either poster art or still photo from one of the movies, and drive-in style audio. Directions to burn are super easy. Download zipped folder, open it and extract the VIDEO TS folder. Burn VIDEO TS folder onto a blank disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This disc features another Roger Corman double-bill, NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST & THE GIANT LEECHES, as well as the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show!",
