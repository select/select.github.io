      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu with poster art and drive-in style audio. SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the .zip, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the quickest way. But I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This disc contains the movies VULCAN, SON OF JUPITER & ATLAS IN THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPS, along with the preview and intermission reels laid out to play like an old drive in show.",
