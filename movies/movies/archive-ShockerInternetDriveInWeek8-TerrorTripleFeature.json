      "description": "Welcome back to everyone's favorite drive-in where the hot dogs are hot, the popcorn popped, and the movies are usually bad. Regrettably, I am sad to say we do not have a cartoon this week ... but we had to make room for our first \"Terrible Terror Triple Feature\"! In answer to several requests, we are proud to present those two terrible turkeys - \"The Giant Gila Monster\" and \"The Killer Shrews\" - but as an extra bonus feature, we bring you \"Attack of The Giant Leeches\". Yes, my fellow followers of fun horrors, that is three films for the price of none! And though there is no cartoon, there are plenty of vintage drive-in advertisements and fun. So sit back, put the top down, smoke 'em if you got 'em, and enjoy the \"Terrible Terror Triple Feature\"!

We have no problem with this - after all these are in public domain - but we do ask that you give our web site a little mention and credit. - Thanks The Management)",
