      "description": "This is a fragment of a film that D W Griffith made in 1909. I wish I had the full video. I would love to finish adding music to it. In this one, though there is no indication of Christmas I have taken a cue from Santa and chosen Christmas music from the era. The title card says \"A Trap for Santa\" but advertising called it \"A Trap For Santa Claus\" Here is how IMDB describes the full plot \"The children set a trap for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, knowing he has to come through the window because their estate has no chimney. Their father, who abandoned them and his wife before she inherited her fortune, plans to burglarize that very house, unaware of the occupants or the trap.\" Sounds like a winner to me.",
