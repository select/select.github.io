      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. As an early martial-arts film, Red Heroine has a lot to offer. It has fantasy elements, sword fighting, and plenty of special effects. While there doesn't seem to be much evidence of surviving reviews or box office returns, this film seems to have enough to offer that it was likely a hit on release.  Though it is the highest quality picture I could find, this version has part of the picture cut off. Because of this, new English subtitles are burnt-in to the picture to translate what is off screen or frankly just poorly translated. ",
