IMDB page: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017866 Colorized using DeOldify technology plus extra colour correction (it was difficult to get the colour balance right on this film). Italian intertitles with English subtitles. Soundtrack compiled from public domain classical music pieces. (Note: Although this movie is public domain, the colorization is copyright by me. My colorized movies are freely uploaded for free personal use. Please don't put them on your own YouTube channel and monetize them. Thanks.)",
