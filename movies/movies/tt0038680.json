      "description": "“Chesterfield strikes with a real winner” “What a cute little movie!” (IMDB reviews quotes). Hip dialog and a clever screenplay combine to make this a highly entertaining seriocomic little quickie. Pat Farr is the only marginal link in an otherwise good cast. Adequate second-feature production values. Recommended. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Charles Lamont. Released in 1936. Complete print.",

Indeed, Mary's forefathers all had gambling in their blood and if she does ever get to try the tables anything could happen.",
