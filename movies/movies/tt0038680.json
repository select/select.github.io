      "description": "“Chesterfield strikes with a real winner” “What a cute little movie!” (IMDB reviews quotes). Hip dialog and a clever screenplay combine to make this a highly entertaining seriocomic little quickie. Pat Farr is the only marginal link in an otherwise good cast. Adequate second-feature production values. Recommended. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Charles Lamont. Released in 1936. Complete print.",
