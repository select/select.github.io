      "description": "SPECIAL NOTE: This film was shot in two versions with a different director of photography for each. One is in standard 35mm and the other in an early 65mm widescreen process. The Depression and then WW2 stalled further widescreen development until the the late ‘40s. “Masterful cinema” “Totally grand fun!” “Surprisingly scary” “Great atmosphere and impressive sets” “Silly, hokey and Wonderful” (IMDB reviews quotes).   Murder mystery, suspense and comedy based on a successful stage play by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood. Good cast and good production noted for its innovative visuals, Eighty minutes plus of old-dark-house fun. Remade in 1937 as “Sh! The Octopus,” in 1939 as “The Gorilla” and in 1956 as “The Bat.” IMDB rating 6.5. Directed by Roland West. Released in 1930. Complete Print AKA “Roland West’s The Bat Whispers” TRIVIA: Allegedly this film was Bob Kane’s inspiration for Batman.",
