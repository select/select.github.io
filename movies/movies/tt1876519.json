    "Plot": "The Vaudeville team of Harry Jans and Harold Whalen star in this one, a strange combination of comedy and dance. The duo behave, at times, as if they are performing in front of an audience and their humor is strictly cornball. Their routine picks up a bit when they do a variation of the old 'Niagara Falls' routine--the one where the guy is talking about being ditched by his wife and then he begins beating the snot out of the guy listening. A woman enters and as he's about to slap her around she leaves.Then the two men rejoin each other and they do a nice tap dance number that is combined with comedy. I would have actually preferred if it was played straight, as the guy's dancing was nice and kept getting interrupted by the comedy...which wasn't all that funny. An interesting curio and modestly entertaining.",
