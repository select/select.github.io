      "description": "April 1863, Civil War: Things are looking bleak for the Union Army. In an effort to harm the Confederate troops, Colonel Marlowe ( John Wayne ) receives orders to destroy a strategically important railroad station behind enemy lines. To Marlowe's chagrin, he has to take the pacifist Dr. Kendall ( William Holden ) with him, with whom he is at odds. During the advance, the troops camp on the plantation of the Southerner Hannah ( Constance Towers ), who sees through the Yankees' plans. To prevent her from jeopardizing the mission, Marlowe takes her prisoner. At \"Newton Station,\" the objective of the mission, a horrific massacre occurs... John Ford 's (1895-1973) only feature-length film about the Civil War is not a typical Western, but a gripping historical adventure based on authentic events.",
