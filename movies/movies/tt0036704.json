      "description": "With London of the 1860s and the gas-lit music halls providing the locale, most of the first half of the film is taken up with either Tommy Trinder or Stanley Holloway singing songs. The plot concerns a feud between two music halls and, then, their joint efforts to keep from being closed by municipal authorities. Supporting the two singing stars are Betty Warren, owner of one of the music halls; her daughter, Jean Kent, who is in love with a nobleman, and Harry Fowler as a backstage assistant.  ",
