      "description": "The House of The Closed Shutters was produced in 1910. It is a Civil War story about a man who turns out to be a coward so his mother closes the shutters of her house for years after. Like many of Griffith's shorts, it is over done with histrionics, particularly by the mother. It is of interest only historically.",
