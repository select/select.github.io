This was his first starring role in a full-length feature film. Buster Keaton is said to have been recommended for the role by Douglas Fairbanks, who had played the character on stage. \"The Saphead\" was a stepping stone on Buster Keaton's way to stardom. To enjoy fully \"The Saphead\" and avoid disappointment the viewers should know that the typical Buster Keaton that we know appears in the last 15 minutes of the film, when we can see him as the master of physical comedy in a series of amazing stunts.
