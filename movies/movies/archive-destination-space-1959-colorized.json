      "description": "In this pilot for a proposed TV series about our early attempts to explore outer space, the U.S. attempts to launch a mission to the Moon from its orbiting space station, but during final count-down a meteor strikes the station a glancing blow, causing a costly delay. The director of the space program (Harry Townes) is called to testify at Senate hearings where an influential senator (Robert Cornthwaite) proposes switching to a less-expensive ground-based launch control center and forces the inclusion of an independent scientific observer (Edward Platt) to assess the situation.  With John Agar, Charles Aidman, Cecil Kellaway, Whitney Blake, and Gail Kobe. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
