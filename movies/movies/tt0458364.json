It's been several years since a teenager posted a photo of his girlfriend on the Internet, hoping to brag to his friends about it. Nothing to spoil his happy careless adult life, but the Internet remembers everything. When a chain of mystical events destroys his dream life, his fiancée receives a series of frightful messages that turn her life into a nightmare.\n2021.

When he gets fired, he takes a job in Ohio working at the ad agency where her father is assistant director. Tom's assigned to report to Chip, a competitive, hard-driving guy who's in a wheelchair and who's Sofia's ex-boyfriend - from high school.
