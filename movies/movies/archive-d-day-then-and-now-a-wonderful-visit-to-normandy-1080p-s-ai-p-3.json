      "description": "Last month my wife and I visited the D-day area in Normandy four weeks ago. This video captures the highlights of our visit in the form of then and now: historic 1944 footage versus present day 2024 footage. The following locations were visited and compared to June 1944: - The German Gun battery at Longues sur Mer - The famous house at Juno beach, filmed by sergeant Bill Grant - Canada house at Juno beach: Bernières sur Mer - The old station at Bernière sur Mer - Remnants of tank tracks at Bernière sur Mer - Arromanche and the Mulberry harbour - The emotional British Normandy Memorial near Ver sur Mer - The \"Standing with Giants\" project at this memorial - The British cemetery at Bayeux - The Pegasus bridge at Ranville, famous for its capture with gliders - The Memorial Pegasus Museum with a replica of a Horsa glider - The famous Pegasus bridge café owned by the Gondré family - Colville sur Mer and its church, destroyed during WW-II - The American war cemetery at Colville sur Mer and Omaha beach - The German Gun battery at Pointe du Hoc. Highlight of this film to my opinion is the emotional \"Standing with Giants\" display at the British Normandy Memorial. Before watching this film it is recommended to first watch my recent restored and colorized video about D-day, related to its 80th commemmoration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COiRzII62KQ",
