    "Plot": "This isn't bad for an American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph film. It chooses some interesting camera positions which give some unusual insights into the 1904 Vanderbilt Cup Race.What is most striking is the lack of crowd control at this event. One shot is from a corner of the route. The cars can be seen approaching from some distance and as they approach the corner a couple of guys start waving white flags to clear the crowd that is allowed to roam freely across the track between vehicles. In another shot from above a straight length of road the crowds on either side of the road are seen strolling into it between passing vehicles and slowly retreating as the cars approach. I guess the organisers figured they could rely on people's common sense, but Health and Safety would have a fit today.",
