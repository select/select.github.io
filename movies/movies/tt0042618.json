    "Plot": "Big-time racketeer Martin Martin, on the eve of his projected move into New York politics, barely escapes the District Attorney's men who attempt to arrest him for a murder committed five-years earlier by Martin and his former partner Dane Cory. Martin, who knows that Cory has copped a plea with the D.A. to save himself, arranges a meeting. At the meeting, Cory's henchman, Cute Freddie, shoots Martin and the latter kills Freddie. Cory hides in the Greenwich Village apartment of his girl friend, burlesque queen Lily White. With them is Lily's six-year-old daughter, Elsie, and her dog Skipper. Martin trails Cory, but weakened by his bullet wound, is forced to seek refuge in an abandoned building next to Lily's. Bad-to-the-bone Cory kicks Skipper and the dog finds shelter with Martin, where Elsie finds them sleeping. Martin is charmed by Elsie and the dog, whom he names Johnny One-Eye, and takes the animal to a vet who can't help the dog but does take the bullet slug out of Martin. Barely eluding capture, Martin returns to the building where Elsie tells him she is Lily's daughter, and that Cory is hiding in their house. Later Cory follows Elsie to where Martin is hiding. She is caught in the line of fire and, to save her, Martin exposes himself for a fatal wound from Cory but not before he kills Cory. His last words to a policeman are: \"Buy Elsie another dog, and make sure he has two good eyes.\"",
