      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Best Picture winner Wings stars Clara Bow and Buddy Rogers. This remains the only fully silent film to win best picture, although it does have a synchronized soundtrack for music and effects.",
