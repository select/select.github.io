When he walks into a bank and finds all the employees bound-and-gagged, Daly senses that something is not quite right. The announced on the television set says that gangster Desperate Dumkopf is on the loose. Dumkopf, a master of disguise, transforms himself into a lamp-post and follows Daly. Dunkopf then changes into a scout-master and directs Daly to walk off a cliff. Daly, however, comes to no harm, and, in the battle that follows, unmasks Dumkopf and earns another merit badge.
