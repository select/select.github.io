      "description": "In Heavenly Daze (1948), the Three Stooges, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, find themselves in the afterlife after a mishap on Earth. Shemp is sent back to perform good deeds for his former pals in order to earn his wings and a place in heaven. Disguised as a mortal, he tries to guide Moe and Larry away from trouble and help them make an honest living. His efforts lead to a string of misunderstandings, slapstick chaos, and ghostly gags. The short blends comedy and fantasy, offering a clever twist on the Stooges’ usual earthbound antics. Colorized and digitally enhanced as God intended.",
