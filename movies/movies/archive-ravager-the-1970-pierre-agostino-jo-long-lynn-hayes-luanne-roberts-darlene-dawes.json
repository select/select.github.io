      "description": "Yet another \"Vietnam war vet goes crazy\" movie. Hitting so many hot points it would make a dangerous drinking game. First our bad guy is an immigrant (unspecified origin), second he is a war vet. Thirdly, after witnessing a woman raped and killed during the war (trauma) he puts his demolition skills (fourth he is a mad bomber) to work killing promiscuous couples (fifth having sex in a movie equals death).  Pierre Agostino plays our bad guy and B Movie regular Luann Roberts is among the victims. Oddly none of the other actresses playing victims appeared in more than a couple other movies. Truly a terrible movie from every aspect. Bad writing, static directing, complete lack of special effects. Enjoy.",
