In a rage, the two men strike him on the head and, persuaded that the busybody is dead, ask their broker to dump the body off in a deserted place. But the broker has an accident and is killed in the crash. The cashier, who was actually still alive, comes to and, while suffering a loss of memory, wanders off. Still believing their employee dead, the two Peabodys accuse their cashier of having stolen the money. But Beatrice Forbes, Paul Revere's daughter and her boyfriend, idle-turned-responsible Billy Winthrop, are on the alert.",
