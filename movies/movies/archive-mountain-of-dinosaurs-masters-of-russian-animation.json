      "description": "The story follows the lives of dinosaurs as they fall in love and have children, their eggs hatched by the hot sun as their parents look on. As the weather begins to cool, the shells begin to thicken, refusing to let the dinosaur babies leave, eventually resulting in their extinction. The second feature by Rasa Strautmane was so visually light and simple that the Soviet censors did not recognize the intended parallel between the protective shell which suffocated the baby dinosaur and the Soviet State's oppressive care of the individual.",
