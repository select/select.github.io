When this is successful, they move back to Miami slums. However this offends the former illegal inhabitants of the rundown two story house they settle in, all loyal customers of drug baron Cream. The conflict escalates into a bloody gunfight, but what the boys don't know is that Cream is just a henchman for the merciless Miami drug lord Nestor, who also has Carlos' girl Nikki with him.",
