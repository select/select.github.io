      "description": "“Would not be allowed today” “Not so romantic” “There’s no fool like an old fool” (IMDB reviews quotes). An English girls boarding school comedy where most of the “girls” appear to be beyond voting age. However the comedy soon morphs into drama when one of the students seduces a middle-age teacher. Good cast and adequate production values. Petula doesn’t sing but she dances (uh sort of). Recommended for when your skydiving jump has been rained out. IMDB rating 6.2. Directed by Edmond T Greville Released in 1949 (UK). Complete print (UK TV rip). AKA “Naughty Arlette” CAST NOTE: The feature film debuts of Adrienne Corri and Christine Finn",
