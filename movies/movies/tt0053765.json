      "description": "The Goddess a silent film from China made in 1934 and starring Ruan Lingyu in a stunning performance is the story of a prostitute and her son. (The word for Goddess in Chinese also means a loose woman) It was directed by Wu Yonggang. It is a simply lovely film which will move you as few silent films can. I discovered it on the Archive, stabilized the print and added a music track and some titles. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",
