      "description": "Crazy House is a 1943 comedy film starring Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson as Broadway stars who return to Universal Studios to make another movie. The mere mention of Olsen and Johnson's names evacuates the studio and terrorizes the management and personnel. Undaunted, the comedians hire an assistant director and unknown talent, and set out to make their own movie. Financed by an eccentric \"angel\" ( Percy Kilbride ), the completed feature is set to premiere when angry creditors confiscate most of the film. Olsen and Johnson keep the preview going, anyway, and their venture is a success. Crazy House is notable for its impressive cast of supporting comedians (Percy Kilbride, Cass Daley , Shemp Howard , Edgar Kennedy , Franklin Pangborn , Billy Gilbert , Richard Lane , Andrew Tombes , Chester Clute , and Hans Conried ) and guest stars under contract to Universal at the time ( Allan Jones , Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce , Robert Paige , Leo Carrillo , Johnny Mack Brown , Andy Devine ).",
