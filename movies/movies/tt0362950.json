    "Plot": "Pa Sees Some New Styles (1915) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Harry Palmer made a handful of animated shorts for the \"Keeping Up with the Kellys\" series. This one here has Pa going to look for a new hat so that he can keep up-to-date in regards to style. The second portion of the three minute short has Pa going to bed when a black cat comes in and the full moon rises. Overall there's certainly nothing ground- breaking about this film as it didn't change history of anything like that. If you're a fan of these early animated movies then you should find this one here entertaining enough to where it warrants being viewed. The animation itself was quite good but I must say that I really didn't get much of a kick out of the lead character.",
