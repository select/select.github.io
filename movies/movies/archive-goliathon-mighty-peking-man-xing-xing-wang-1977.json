      "description": "The Shaw Brothers take on King Kong. They don't physically fight him, they just retell the story with Chinese actors and a very much not Chinese heroine.  Much like like Godzilla the monster is portrayed by an actor in a suit apparently made with real human hair for some reason. Evelyne Kraft plays Samantha but unlike Faye Ray's character t Samantha already lives on Kong Island as a jungle girl. This plot change allows Ms Kraft to spend a lot of time in a costume that does not cover much up. ",
