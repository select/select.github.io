    "Plot": "A pilot - a white dog with one black ear - takes a trip to the South Pole, which is a physical thing with red stripes, making it resemble a barber pole. He is rude or indifferent to his assistant, a mouse who is forced to make him lunch, carry supplies in a bag several times his size and shovel snow from the top of the plane. Midair refueling is accomplished by flying elephants who pour the fuel from their trunks. Once the pair reaches the antarctic wasteland, they plow into a snow-capped mountain top and end up with a sleeping walrus on their plane. The mouse pushes off the walrus, who is still in his bed. Walrus and bed crash through the ice below, infuriating the creature. Later, the penguin Rotarians present the dog with a symbolic key, but the walrus interrupts the ceremony to take his revenge.",
