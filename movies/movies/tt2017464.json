      "description": "Koreyoshi Kurahara’s ingeniously plotted, pocket-size noir concerns the intertwined fates of a desperate bank manager, blackmailed for book-cooking, and his resentful but timid underling, passed over for a promotion. The marvelously moody  Intimidation  ( Aru kyouhaku ) is an elegantly stripped-down and carefully paced crime drama.",
