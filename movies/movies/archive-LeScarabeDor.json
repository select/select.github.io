      "description": "1907 Segundo de Chomón Le Scarabe d'or (The Golden Beetle) Note: This film is often incorrectly attributed to Ferdinand Zecca, a very talented comtemporary film-maker who often collaborated on films with Segundo de Chomón through Pathé Frères, for its direction. Weird, creative, and colorful, the visuals in \"The Golden Beetle\" are as spectacular as anything made in the early years of cinema. This had to have taken both a lot of skill and a lot of work to plan and execute. It uses several forms of trick photography, and also has lavish color produced by the old laborious process of hand-tinting each frame. The results are worth it, and it's still entertaining to watch over 90 years later. Much of the time, the succession of strange images is almost seamless, and there is not a dull moment. The actual story, though simple, is also rather amusing in itself. - 29 March 2002 | by Snow Leopard (Ohio) Director: Segundo de Chomón Country: France Language: French Production Co: Pathé Frères Also Known As (AKA) Le Scarabe d'or - France (original title) Aranybogár - Hungary The Golden Beetle - USA",
