      "description": "“Getting a lot out of 56 minutes” “Rare Anthony Mann film” “Creepy Freudian Gothic” (IMDB reviews quotes) A most unusual second feature mystery in which a WW2 marine receives love letters from a girl who has never been seen alive. Discovering the truth becomes a descent into madness. Good compact cast of only four main characters. However Helen Thimig’s performance as a woman who will stop at nothing steals the show. Recommended for when you feel like spending an hour on the dark side. IMDB rating 6.5. Directed by Anthony Mann. Released in 1944. Complete print. AKA “House of Terror”",
