      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. Features a custom menu with either poster art or a still photo from one of the movies and drive-in style audio. Burning this DVD is really easy: Download the zipped folder, open it, and extract the VIDEO TS folder. Grab a blank DVD and burn the VIDEO TS folder, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This DVD features SNOW CREATURE & THE PHANTOM PLANET, with previews and intermission reels. Enjoy the show!",
