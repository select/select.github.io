      "description": "ViaGrafix Video training Services presents: Using Word for Windows, Beginners. This instruction video from 78 minutes gives you an impression from the very first Word for Windows. This tape was thrown away in the office where I worked last year and in my opinion it represents a piece of computer-history. As today nobody works with this version of Word for Windows anymore, we must not forget that we also had 'ancient' programs from the windows 3.1 and 3.11 era for personal computers. This video-instruction belongs to a museum and before the last copy is thrown away, we'll put it on www.archive.org. Instructors: Kurt Gwartney & Kathryn Sparks Written by Chris Morrison Editor: Michelle Heuckendorf Lighting: Mike Green Electronic Graphics: Bobbie Reynolds Computers: Mary Lou Williams Continuity: Pamela Kemp Engineering: Ken Holcumb, IBS Grip: Jay Hogan",
