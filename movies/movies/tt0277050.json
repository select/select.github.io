His mother calls - to her he's Trevor - and reminds him to pick up his younger sister, Minne. He meets up with her; she's accompanied by Tim, a friend. Trevor takes them to a French film. On the way out, he overhears a couple talking. She likes the film, her date doesn't. In character, Trevor punches out the guy. The young woman runs off and Trevor chases her.
