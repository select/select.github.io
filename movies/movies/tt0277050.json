His mother calls - to her he's Trevor - and reminds him to pick up his younger sister, Minne. He meets up with her; she's accompanied by Tim, a friend. Trevor takes them to a French film. On the way out, he overhears a couple talking. She likes the film, her date doesn't. In character, Trevor punches out the guy. The young woman runs off and Trevor chases her. Has Trevor as Belmondo already pictured this scene?",
