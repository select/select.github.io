      "description": "Lonely Villa was directed by D W Griffith in 1909. If you look it up on Wikipedia or IMDB it is listed as \"The Lonely Villa\" but the name on the title card is as presented here. An interesting drama with a simple plot. Watch the tramp who first visits the house with the letter. You can almost hear him taking vocal directions from Griffith.",
