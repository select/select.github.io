      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This anti-alcohol film is about a man who's drinking habits causes him to lose everything. Contemporary reviews were positive, as may have been expected during prohibition, though modern reviews are definitely softer in their praise. The picture was selected as part of the Pioneers of African-American Cinema set by Kino Lorber.",
