    "Plot": "An archaeologist working in Southern Mexico believes that there are remnants of the ancient Toltec civilization in a remote area. He requests a photographer, and is frustrated when he is sent a young woman to do the job. He continually annoys her with his narrow-minded remarks, yet she takes the pictures he requests of a local fiesta, and later she convinces a plantation owner from the area to be their guide. As they begin the trip in search of the archaeologist's goal, he begins to respect the young photographer. But as both he and their guide become increasingly attracted to her, tensions begin to build, even as they face ever-increasing dangers.",
