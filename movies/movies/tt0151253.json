    "Plot": "Krazy Kat is the commentator on this cartoon newsreel. It was an occasional format for cartoons in this period, perfect for offering blackout gags. That's a term derived from burlesque, in which a very brief skit wuld be offered; hit the punchline, the stage goes dark, and then the spotlight opens on another skit.During this period, the animated Kray Kat not only bore no relationship to George Herriman's classic comic strip, he changed his voice from one cartoon to the next. In this one, the character uses several different voices....although probably only one voice actor, mimicking several radio and screen personalities.",
