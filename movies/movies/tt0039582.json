      "description": "TAGLINES : It's Wild and Wacky...and Romantically Gay! (print ad - Lubbock Evening Journal, Palace Theatre, Lubbock, Texas Oct.7, 1947) STORYLINE :  When an Englishwoman dies, leaving behind two children, her devoted friend decides to take the children to find the woman's husband, an American serviceman who had returned to the USA. But the father, now a successful architect, claims not to remember ever having gotten married or having any children. _IMDb by Snow Leopard IMDb User Review : Worth Watching due to actors' performances (Aug. 3, 2019 by dickyadams): From a social point of view, the setup of this is quite interesting as it lightheartedly shows the post war problem of kids left behind by their forces dads returning to the USA. Some criticise it for being a ridiculous setup but the lead character is actually just trying to get a better life by taking advantage of the situation. How many people were desperate to escape ruined Britain at that time? Passport to Pimlico dealt with exactly the same problem but in a much superior way. This film's setup is a bit silly but then lots are. This is an average comedy in the end but it's played well by the actors and isn't a waste of time at all. ** The non-profit streaming of the commercial free, quality films I have very much enjoyed and therefore uploaded to archive.org , are for educational purposes.
