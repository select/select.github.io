      "description": "Well, with summer cooling down, we thought it would be a good idea to celebrate the kids going back to school with every parents' nightmare - Teenagers! And what better way than to present some vintage \"Teen Terrors\" from the 1950's. First up, after the usual coming attractions and invites to the Snack Bar, we are pleased to bring you a wonderful short subject warning our youth about alcohol. Then, our first feature is \"Teenagers From Outer Space\" featuring a \"bad\" kid and a giant Lobster! Finally, after a brief intermission, we proudly bring you the low-budget wonder \"Teenage Zombies\". All in all, we can not think of a better way to bring summer to a close than with a bunch of \"bad\" teens causing a lot of trouble. Let's just hope they stay away from the snack bar! http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://mysite.verizon.net/vze10ote5/shockerdriveinredirectsite/",
