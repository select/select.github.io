      "description": "Just in time for Halloween and those cold, creepy nights at the Ol' Shocker Internet Drive In, we are very happy to bring you another Bela Lugosi triple feature in glorious black and white! After some Bela coming attractions, we are pleased to bring you \"Black Dragons\" with Lugosi playing Dr. Melcher, a Nazi(?) terminating Japanese spies (confused - so are we). Then, our second feature is a bit more traditional as Bela portrays the \"Voodoo Man\". Finally, as the witching hour creeps closer, we proudly present \"The Bowery At Midnight\" with our hero as a criminologist who uses his soup kitchen as a front for a criminal gang who commit a series of daring robberies and murders until some zombies show up in the basement. All in all, you can't miss these classic Lugosi cheap ... er .. creepies! So, come on down to your favorite spooky drive in for some late October fun. And, don't forget that our speakers come equipped with heaters and we have plenty of hot coffee at our snack bar. Boooooo! http://shockerdrivein.freeoda.com/ or http://mysite.verizon.net/vze10ote5/shockerdriveinredirectsite/",
