      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first adaptation of The Three Musketeers to be a big box office hit in America, star Douglas Fairbanks would go on to star in the sequel, The Iron Mask, eight years later as well. While not as well remembered as some of Fairbanks' biggest hits, The Three Musketeers still serves to show what he is remembered for: fantastic stunts and romantic adventure. ",
