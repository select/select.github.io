      "description": "20th Century pilot Buck Rogers (Buster Crabbe) and his young friend Buddy Wade (Jackie Moran) awake from 500 years in suspended animation to find that the world has been taken over by the outlaw army of Killer Kane. They join the rebel forces of Wilma Deering (Constance Moore) and Professor Huer (C. Montague Shaw). Compilation of the original 12-chapter cliffhanger serial with the duplications and separate chapter titles removed. 3 hrs 21 min I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
