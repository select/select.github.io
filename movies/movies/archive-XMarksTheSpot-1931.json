      "description": "A newspaper reporter, with a desparate need for $5,000, borrows the money from a \"shady character.\" Years later the reporter is charged with a murder he did not commit. Spoiler alert, the truth comes out in the end, the bad guy gets what's coming to him, and the good guy has a bright future. There's a little drama along the way, but there's no treasure map. I found this on this website; with most of the opening credits missing, and too much hiss and crackle in the audio. I used a shot of the 1931 movie poster to make a title card, and cleaned up the audio. I might have removed a few damaged frames, too. The sound is in synch and it's a pretty easy watch.",
