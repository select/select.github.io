      "description": "Synopsis Three siblings struggle to find success and happiness in this drama from Iranian filmmaker Siamak Shayeghi. After the death of their parents, sisters Farida (Fatemeh Motamed Aria), Farzhaneh (Ladan Mostofi) and Fereshteh (Pegah Ahangarani) were left to fend for themselves, with eldest Farida becoming the de-facto head of the household. Between being physically handicapped and having to give up a career in education to look after her sisters, Farida has had to forfeit her own life for the good of others. Clever Farzhaneh has a good head for business and is able to support the household overseeing production at a factory; romantically, she finds herself torn between her wealthy boss who is deeply infatuated with her and the awkward but charming low-level engineer who has stolen her heart. And while Fereshteh shows promise as a student of economics, she's increasingly tempted to follow her dreams and instead enroll in a school for aspiring actors. Winter Sleep was screened as an official entry at the 2008 Fajr Film Festival. ~ All Movie Guide Cast: Fatemeh Motamed Aria - Farida Ladan Mostofi - Farzhaneh Pegah Ahangarani - Fereshteh Sharokh Forutunian Kourosh Tahami Amar Tafti Mehdi Miami",
