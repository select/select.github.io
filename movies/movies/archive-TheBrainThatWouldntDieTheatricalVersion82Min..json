      "description": "This is The Brain That Wouldn't Die, but this is a better transfer than what I have seen on the Archive with all 82 min, plus this is widescreen, unlike most of the other copies on the Archive. IMDB for this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052646/ (p.s. I'm not calling this the uncut version because the uncut version, according to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_That_Wouldn%27t_Die#DVD_releases), is 85 min. long and wasn't shown in theaters. This version is widely accepted as extended) The AVI File is Marked as DivX but is in fact an AVI with a wmv2 codec (So that it will play in wmp without a codec pack) EDIT: I have uploaded a .torrent file. Please, if you could, download it and seed for everyone so that everyone else can have a faster downloading experience.",
