For the first time, they can be heard in a gaudy, grandiose music comedy revue. But also appearing are actors and actresses from the first 'talkies', stars from Broadway, and, of course, the German shepherd Rin-Tin-Tin. Frank Fay is the host of the more than 70 well-known stars who show various acts.",
