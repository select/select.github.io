      "description": "How about going back in time and fly with the KLM with a Fokker F.VII aircraft from Amsterdam to Paris in 1929? No long check-in times, no conveyer belts, no gates, no luggage claim areas, no queus, no removal of belts and shoes, no jumbo's, but in stead just a simple step ladder to board the plane with your suitcase in your hand to join the other half-a-dozen passengers. Aircraft in those times were noisy, cold, choppy and could only fly at low altitude because of the lack of a pressure cabin. Seats were made of wicker and the only entertainment was the stewardess trying to serve coffee while attempting to keep her balance... The original B&W film has been motion-stabilized, speed-corrected, A.I. enhanced and A.I. colorized. Source B&W footage: Beeld En Geluid.",
