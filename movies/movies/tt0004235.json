    "Plot": "Dorothy, the sweet and unsophisticated daughter of a country clergyman, is invited up to Newport by her worldly cousin for a weekend visit. After a day of sight-seeing, she is metamorphosed by borrowed finery into a typical social butterfly. Blundering into a heavy game of bridge, she loses heavily to her hostess, who presses her for payment. A middle-aged roué induces her to accept his check for the amount, which she endorses and turns over to her hostess. To her consternation the roué then shows his hand and insists on a pro quid quo for his money. As Dorothy cannot appeal to her father for money for a gambling debt, she is in a dilemma. She tells her story to Lt. Hawkhurst. He bribes a social tame-cat to part with some of the hostess' love letters and, using them as a bludgeon, finally induces that lady to hand over a check. He then tears it up under the roué's nose and throws him out of the place. An engagement between the lieutenant and Dorothy now closes the affair.",
