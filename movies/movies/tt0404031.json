He is happily married to his wife Tree (Jennifer Gates) and they are trying to have a baby, but he is afraid that his financial situation affects his marriage. Out of the blue, the weird producer George (Udo Kier) offers the true story of a real homicide that happened thirty-five years ago to Jeff to write the screenplay. He accepts the offer and learns that the killer killed his pregnant wife and in-laws and committed suicide after. While writing the screenplay, Jeff sees many friends and acquaintances dying and questions whether his writing is causing the deaths.",
