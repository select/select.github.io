      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This tragedy stars Lon Chaney as a man who has lost everything, and as a new career relives his losses every night. He dreams of revenge on the people who ruined him, but what can a circus clown do? He Who Gets Slapped also stars Norma Shearer as another circus performer, and was a critical and box office success on release. Modern rankings think of it as one of the finest films of 1924.",

      "description": "DVD remux of the 1924 MGM film \"He Who Gets Slapped.\" (No soundtrack. Frame rate corrected to 18 FPS using MKVToolnix.) IMDb TMDB Wikipedia He Who Gets Slapped is a 1924 American silent psychological thriller tragedy film starring Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, and John Gilbert, and directed by Victor Sjöström (credited as Victor Seastrom). The film was written by Victor Seastrom and Carey Wilson, based on the Russian play He Who Gets Slapped (Тот, кто получает пощёчины; Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny) by playwright Leonid Andreyev, which was completed by Andreyev in August 1915, two months before its world premiere at the Moscow Art Theatre on October 27, 1915. A critically successful Broadway production, using an English language translation of the original Russian by Gregory Zilboorg, was staged in 1922, premiering at the Garrick Theatre on January 9, 1922, with Richard Bennett (actor) playing the \"HE\" role on stage. The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916. He Who Gets Slapped was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable and critically hailed. It was also the first film to feature a lion as the mascot for MGM. Created by Howard Dietz, the lion logo was first used for the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation film Polly of the Circus (1917 film) and passed on to MGM when Goldwyn merged with two other companies to form MGM. Coincidentally, a real lion plays a key plot point in the Chaney film's plotline. The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Seastrom. Victor Seastrom called Chaney \"the finest actor in the history of the screen or the stage\". George Davis, a popular European clown, coached Chaney in his clown role. The circus sequences took two weeks to film on the studio's largest stage. Stills exist showing details of Chaney's makeup as both Paul Beaumont and \"HE\". In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film entered the public domain on January 1, 2020 (along with all American films from 1924) as dictated by U.S. copyright law.",

      "description": "IRONIA DA SORTE ( He Who Gets Slapped ) ( Filme Completo / Legendado em Português ) Data de Lançamento: 09  de Novembro de 1924 » SOBRE O FILME: O filme conta a história de um gênio científico que é humilhado pela esposa. Para expressar sua dor, ele se torna um palhaço de circo. Lá, aparentemente, ele encontra uma chance de renovação. Mas será que ele conseguirá encontrar a felicidade? . HE WHO GETS SLAPPED (Ironia da Sorte) foi o primeiro filme totalmente preparado e produzido pela MGM. Os seis meses que antecederam sua entrega à organização distribuidora em outubro de 1924 também foram ocupados em concluir, editar e liberar imagens originadas pelas empresas Metro, Goldwyn e Mayer. Mas Mayer e Thalberg sempre tiveram em mente a importância de fazer deste filme uma demonstração impressionante dos poderes do novo estúdio.  . Eles designaram três estrelas - Norma Shearer, John Gilbert e Lon Chaney (foto acima) - e o célebre diretor sueco Victor Seastrom (que também escreveu o roteiro com Carey Wilson) à história de um cientista que começou uma nova vida como palhaço de circo. O elenco inclui Tully Marshall, Marc MacDermott, Ford Sterling e Paulette Duval. Foi baseado em uma peça russa encenada alguns anos antes na Broadway pelo Theatre Guild: uma escolha arriscada para a estréia do estúdio porque, embora lidasse com elementos melodramáticos como um barão perverso perseguindo a heroína e assassinato por meio de um leão faminto, seu efeito tinha que ser o de uma tragédia sombria e poética. Felizmente, provou ser um sucesso artístico e comercial. A MGM descobriu o seu caminho. » » DIREÇÃO: Victor Sjöström  GÊNERO: Drama, Romance, Thriller ORIGEM: USA  DURAÇÃO: 1h 11min » » ELENCO PRINCIPAL: Lon Chaney ... Paul Beaumont Norma Shearer ...

She, however, is courted by the dashing Bezano (John Gilbert), a horseback rider. As Consuelo’s greedy father schemes to marry her off to a wealthy nobleman, Paul faces a heart-wrenching choice: remain the tragic clown mocked by the world or fight to protect the woman he loves.\n\nThe story culminates in a powerful finale of love, sacrifice, and revenge that showcases Chaney’s extraordinary emotional range.\n\nCast and Crew:\n• Director: Victor Sjöström\n• Production: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM’s first feature film)\n• Based on the play He Who Gets Slapped by Leonid Andreyev\n\nStarring:\n• Lon Chaney as Paul Beaumont (“He”)\n• Norma Shearer as Consuelo\n• John Gilbert as Bezano\n• Marc McDermott as Baron Regnard\n• Tully Marshall as Count Mancini\n\nFilm Significance:\nHe Who Gets Slapped is a landmark in cinema history:\n\nThe first MGM production, establishing the studio as a powerhouse.\n\nConsidered one of Lon Chaney’s greatest performances, cementing his reputation as “The Man of a Thousand Faces.”\n\nDirected by Victor Sjöström, whose influence extended to later masters like Ingmar Bergman.\n\nA perfect blend of tragedy, symbolism, and psychological storytelling, with circus imagery that foreshadows Browning’s The Unknown and Freaks.\n\nEnhanced Public Domain Explanation:\nThis film is in the public domain, meaning it can be freely shared, studied, and preserved.
