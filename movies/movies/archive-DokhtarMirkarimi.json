      "description": "THE DAUGHTER DOKHTAR     Director: REZA MIRKARIMI The strict and traditional Mr Azizi leads an uneventful family life in an oil town of southern Iran. Then one day, exasperated by her father’s authoritarianism, Setareh announces she is off to Tehran to say farewell to one of her best friends who is leaving Iran for good. Unfortunately, the engagement celebrations of Setareh’s younger sister are taking place simultaneously. Despite her father’s objections Setareh takes the plane for Tehran. This act of disobedience sets in motion a series of perturbations that upset the calm tranquility of the paterfamilias. script    MEHRAN KASHANI camera    HAMID KHOZOUEI ABYANEH design    MOHSEN SHAH EBRAHIMI music    MOHAMMAD REZA ALIGHOLI sound    BAHMAN ARDALAN, AMIR HOSEIN GHASEMI cast    FARHAD ASLANI, MERILA ZAREI, MAHOUR ALVAND producer    REZA MIRKARIMI production    REZA MIRKARIMI, ARVAND FREE ZONE ORGANIZATION world sales    DREAMLAB FILMS WWW.DREAMLABFILMS.COM     Iran     2016, 103'",
