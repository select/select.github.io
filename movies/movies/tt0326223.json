    "Plot": "How a thoroughly respectable British householder, bitterly opposed to woman's suffrage, becomes apparently a violent advocate of the cause, the difficulties this gets him into finally leading to his arrest, his forcible rescue by a band of suffragettes who believe him their champion, his final arrival home in a torn and dilapidated condition before his astonished wife and, above all, how the fatal \"votes for women\" confronts him at the end. All these make the fun fast and furious.",
