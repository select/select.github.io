      "description": "A deranged sculptor who creates particularly lifelike bronze sculptures edges to the brink of artistic success when the art market latches onto one of his masterpieces. No one realises that he is a maniac who uses real women as moulds for his sculptures, but lurking inside his latest work is a live  model hell-bent on avenging her submersion in liquid bronze.",
