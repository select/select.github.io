      "description": "A strange very artsy film about a Anita Berber who, apparently, was infamous in post WWI Germany. Not a great copy of the film and rather hard to watch for anyone expecting a polished work. Posted because it is a bit hard to find. Hard coded subtitles over German dialog cards.",
