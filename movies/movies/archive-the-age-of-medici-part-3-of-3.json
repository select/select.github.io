      "description": "Roberto Rossellini’s three-part  The Age of the Medici is like a Renaissance painting come to life: a portrait of fifteenth-century Florence, ruled by the Medici political dynasty. With a lovely score from composer Manuel de Sica (son of Vittorio), this grand yet intimate work is a storybook conjuring of a way of life and thought.",
