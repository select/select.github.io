    "Plot": "After graduating from high school 19 year old Göran goes to his uncle Anders's farm in the countryside for recreation. It's summer and a lot of work to do at the farm, but he, the city student, isn't accustomed to that. He falls in love with 17 year old Kerstin, and suddenly he is very engaged in country life. Göran is a foreigner, but he quickly blends in with the village youth. They are in a bitter conflict with the vicar, who condemns all their activities as immoral. When the vicar forbids the youth to use the school for their meetings anymore, Anders gives them an old barn, which they start renovating. Kerstin has a strict mother, who in vain forbids her to take part in the youth activities. She goes there with Göran. She is a bit shy, but the romance between them develops step by step, until it is fulfilled a summer night, when they swim naked in a lake. Despite all efforts of Kerstin's parents and the vicar, they cannot stop Kerstin and Göran from meeting each other also when autumn has arrived. When a road accident suddenly ends Kerstin's life, Göran is accused by the vicar for being a seducer that had led Kerstin astray.",
