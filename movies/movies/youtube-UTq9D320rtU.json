Harvey, Frank Gerstle\nDirector: Bill Karn\n\nThis True Crime exposé goes deep into the criminal mind of John Omar Pinson, the three-time loser once listed on the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted list. He’s portrayed by veteran small-screen baddie Myron Healey, and his twisted tale of murder & mayhem is based entirely on intel from law enforcement agencies across the five western states.",
