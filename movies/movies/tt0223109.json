    "Plot": "Presumably, this is one in a series of four short dance performances devoted to the seasons. WINTER, SNOW DANCE appears to be the only one of these films to survive (although it isn't clear if Alice Guy made the other three or not). Note the unusual copyright notice that appears momentarily in the lower right-hand corner of the screen and then disappears just as quickly. Numerous tricks of this sort were used during the era to discourage counterfeiting and illegal distribution.",
