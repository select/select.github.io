      "description": "Jack and the Beanstalk (1902) Director: Edwin S. Porter, George S. Fleming Jack and the Beanstalk is a 1902 American silent trick film directed by George S. Fleming and Edwin S. Porter. With ten sequential shots, Jack and the Beanstalk was twice as long as any previous studio film. According to Porter, \"It took in the neighborhood of six weeks in the spring of 1902 to successfully make this photograph.\" Reception: In The First Twenty Years: A Segment of Film History, Kemp Niver notes that \"the sets were extremely impressive, for they showed considerable ingenuity in their design... Throughout the film, Porter used the possibilities of a moving picture camera in a new way through the spectacular use of dissolves between scenes, stop camera action to allow people to appear and disappear, and the use of lantern slides as a projector of thought within a moving picture production.\" Similarly, Charles Musser wrote that the film \"contains all the elements that historian A. Nicholas Vardac sees in Life of an American Fireman: the pictorial development of two lines of action, spectacular devices such as the vision that introduces the second line of action, dissolves between scenes, and a change in camera position showing interior and exterior as the action moves from one space to the next.\"",
