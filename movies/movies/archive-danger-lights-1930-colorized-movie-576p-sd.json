      "description": "Danger Lights is a 1930 American Pre-Code drama film , directed by George B. Seitz , from a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman . It stars Louis Wolheim , Robert Armstrong , and Jean Arthur . The plot concerns railroading on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), and the movie was largely filmed along that railroad's lines in Montana . The railway yard in Miles City, Montana , was a primary setting, while rural scenes were shot along the railway line through Sixteen Mile Canyon, Montana. Additional footage was shot in Chicago, Illinois (where the Milwaukee Road was headquartered until 1986, when it went out of business). The film was the first ever shot in the new Spoor-Berggren Natural Vision Process . In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.",
