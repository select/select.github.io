    "Plot": "After Alice is caught pulling a prank in class, she's sent to the corner with a dunce's cap, where she quickly grows tired and begins daydreaming. She imagines herself cavorting with various animals until they're all espied by her teacher, who immediately calls forth her book army to vanquish Alice and friends. After a lengthy chase, Alice defends herself by forming her animal friends into an army; the teacher retaliates using a cannon, and looks to be winning until the animals build their own cannon from a junk heap and fill it with pepper. The battle wages until Alice is awakened from her reverie and discovers she hasn't left her classroom after all.",
