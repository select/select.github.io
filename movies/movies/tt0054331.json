      "description": "A ballet film by the Mosfilm studio based on the famous production by Yuri Grigorovich to the music of Aram Khachaturian. The roles are performed by the greatest dancers of our time - Vladimir Vasiliev and Maris Liepa. A. Khachaturian's ballet, which tells the story of the rebellion of gladiators and slaves led by the Thracian Spartacus and his defeat by the troops of the Roman commander Crassus, is based on true events in the history of Rome (1st century BC).\n\nYear of production: 1975\n\nThe ballet has four main characters, four soloists. These are the conflicting images of Spartacus and Crassus, personifying the clash of two worlds, as well as Spartacus's beloved Phrygia, and the insidious courtesan Aegina, Crassus's accomplice. They express the main ideas and fundamental provisions of the ballet. Revolutionary choreography by Yuri Grigorovich, as well as the performers of the main male roles Vladimir Vasiliev and Maris Liepa - made this ballet immortal.\n\nDirectors: Vadim Derbenev, Yuri Grigorovich\nScriptwriters: Vadim Derbenev, Yuri Grigorovich\nComposer: Aram Khachaturyan\nCinematographers: Viktor Pishchalnikov, Vadim Derbenev\nProduction designers: Valentin Vyrvich, Simon Virsaladze\n\nCast: Natalia Bessmertnova, Nina Timofeeva, Boris Efimov, Alexander Lavrenyuk, Maris Liepa, Vladimir Vasiliev",
