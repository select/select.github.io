      "description": "This (A.I. enhanced & colorized) film shows film footage of Deventer just after the liberation by the Canadians on 10 April 1945. The area was destroyed during the battle with the Germans. It cost the Canadian liberators from the 3rd Division quite some struggle to cross the river IJssel near Gorssel. Collaborators, NSB members and so-called Moffenmeiden are being forcefully paraded through the streets of Deventer by armed resistance fighters. The \"Executioner of the Landwacht\" is forced to parade through the streets at gunpoint and the massive crowd joins in mocking and humiliating the traitors.
