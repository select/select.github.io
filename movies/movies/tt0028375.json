Her father refuses as he knows Randall is a fortune hunter, as did any 30's audience once Bradley Page appeared on the scene. While Penfield hurries out to award the Penfield Prize for Service at his laundry, Babs, finding her allowance has been stopped by her father, tries to sell her car to raise cash to give to Randall. While Babs is talking to the car dealer in his shop, \"Con\" Cornelius, just out of jail, sells the car, pockets the cash and makes a getaway. The car is bought by Jerry Bassett, who has just won the Penfield $1,000 Service and has quit his job at the laundry. (So much for service awards.) Jerry drives his flashy car to the Royal Valley, a swanky resort, where Randal is awaiting financial help from Barbara. Jerry meets Barbara on the road and gives her a lift to the hotel, thinking she is on her way there to apply for a job, and is surprised to later see her as a guest. Some things happen, Barbara sees Randall for what he really is, and decides she'd rather marry Jerry and keep the family laundry business in the hands of a real laundryman... even one who bails out when he gets his hands on a few bucks.",
