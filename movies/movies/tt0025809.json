      "description": "“Quota quickie quipfest” “Enormously appealing” “Well worth your time” “What a glorious discovery!” (IMDB reviews quotes). A delightful seriocomic rags-to-riches fable with an all-British cast headed by Ian Hunter that was an early directorial effort of the outstanding Michael Powell (“The Thief of Bagdad” “49th Parallel” “The Red Shoes” etc.). A low-budget second feature with a good cast and adequate production values. Recommended fun that out-shines its resources. IMDB rating 6.5. Directed by Michael Powell. Released in 1934 (UK).
