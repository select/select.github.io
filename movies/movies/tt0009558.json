His position doesn't last long, but it remains for an automobile and a pretty girl to put him in soft. He is dined and wined at the palatial home of the girl and during his stay was \"some time.\" A tea party is in progress when Billy turns loose a mouse and the excitement starts. He is a bit too rough to suit the old man who shows him the door and the fade-out finds Billy again facing the cold, cold world.",
