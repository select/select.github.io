Meanwhile, a psychopathic gangster, his malignant mentor, and their dipsomaniac driver have the job of picking up the other heroin shipments, hidden in the luggage of unsuspecting travelers. All goes well until they attempt to retrieve the heroin stuffed in a Japanese doll. A little girl and her young mother have the doll, but when the crooks get possession of it, they find that the heroin has mysteriously vanished.",
