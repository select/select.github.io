    "Plot": "801 is a Mockumentary in which filmmakers from the fictional \"Utah Community College\" follow around a local young aspiring Rap artist who goes by the moniker \"Shawshank\". The film \"documents\" Shawshank's attempt to create his first album. He struggles in his efforts to seek inspiration from famous rappers and illicit drugs and quickly becomes frustrated by his failures, which he blames on all the \"haters\" in his life. However, when the \"film crew\" suggest he should search his hometown for inspiration, Shawshank goes on a journey of discovery about Salt Lake City (home to the 801 area code) and the Mormon culture which is embedded therein. Ultimately, Shawshank almost learns about himself and his own abilities as an artist while he searches for redemption.",
