      "description": "After an airplane is forced to crash-land in a remote area, its passengers find themselves face-to-face with an alien force that wants to possess them body and soul—and perhaps take over the entire human race. Filled with creatively repulsive effects—including a very invasive bloblike life-form—Hajime Sato’s  Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell  is a pulpy, apocalyptic gross-out.",
