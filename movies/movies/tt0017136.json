      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Regarded as one of the most influential films ever made, Metropolis was a financial disaster on release. It only made back about a fifth of its budget back. It didn't fare much better with critics or audiences at the time either. Since then it has become beloved by critics and film lovers worldwide, and is still considered one of the best science fiction pictures ever. The film follows a fiscally divided futuristic city that must unite if they are going to survive. ",
