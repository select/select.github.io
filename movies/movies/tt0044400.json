      "description": "In the Great lakes region of pre-Revolutionary America, a Colonial officer and scout (Lex Barker) tries to broker a peace deal between Indian chief Pontiac (Lon Chaney Jr.) of the Ottawa and the commander (Roy Roberts) of the local British fort, which would facilitate the release of a woman (Helen Westcott) being held hostage. But his efforts are sabotaged by the leader of a Hessian mercenary unit (Berry Kroeger) who embarks on a campaign of extermination against the Indians. Lex Barker as Lt. Kent McIntire Helen Westcott as Winifred Lancaster Lon Chaney Jr. as Chief Pontiac (as Lon Chaney) Berry Kroeger as Col. von Weber Roy Roberts as Maj. Gladwin Larry Chance as Hawkbill I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
