      "description": "“Good but short’ “My favorite Wayne B” “Highly recommended” (IMDB reviews quotes). This print is sharper and with better contrast than the existing IA copies. After riding for the Pony Express John Wayne starts a stagecoach line, brings the telegraph to his town, saves a telegraph construction camp from poisoning, beats the bad guys, gets the girl, finishes up with a rip-roarin’ stagecoach race and all in only 54 minuets. Which is a good example of why for action and production values little Republic Pictures was king of the B-westerns. Filmed at Agoura Ranch, Agoura, CA. IMDB rating 6.1. Directed by Mark V Wright. Released in 1936. Complete print. AKA “Stagecoach Run”",
