      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. In this spy drama, Sessue Hayakawa stars as a Japanese spy working for American interests against a German spy, played by Florence Vidor, and her cohorts. Reviews were generally solid, though box office numbers don't seem to have been recorded. Modern viewers like the cast and plot, but feel that the ending hurts the film.  This version of the picture does have some film damage, but it doesn't prevent understanding of the story, and for the most part looks quite nice.",

One of his associates is Kitty Little, a young woman who idealizes both Germany and her brother, who is in the Kaiser's army. They have been obtaining American military secrets through their contact with Major Northfield, who is in charge of a quartermaster depot. Nara-Nara, a young man serving in the secret service of Japan, which is allied with the USA, knows that there is a security leak in Northfield's office. An important troop transport order is soon to come through, and Smith abducts Northfield's secretary so that Kitty can take her place. Meanwhile, Nara-Nara sets up an office as an importer next to Northfield's office, in hopes of learning how the Germans are obtaining their information.",
