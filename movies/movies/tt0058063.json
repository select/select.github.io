      "description": "Babylonians capture Asparia (Anna Maria Potani), the queen of the Hellenes, and, unaware of her true identity, take her to Babylon as a common slave. Through another prisoner, she tries to send word of her capture to Hercules (Rock Stevens), and soon a false rumor that the hero is on his way spreads  through the city. Meanwhile, King Phaleg of Assyria (Mario Petri) convinces Hercules to help him fight the Babylonians, but the two-faced king is secretly conspiring to get his own hands on Asparia.",
