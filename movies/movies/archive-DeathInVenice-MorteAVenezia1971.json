      "description": "Synopsis Based on a novel by Thomas Mann, Death in Venice stars Dirk Bogarde as a German composer who is terrified that he has lost all vestiges of humanity. While visiting Venice, Bogarde falls in love with a beautiful young boy (Bjorn Andresen). The relationship is ruined by Bogardeâs obsession with the boyâs youth and physical perfection; the composer realizes that the child represents an ideal that he can never match. The character played by Dirk Bogarde is evidently intended to be Gustav Mahler, whose haunting music is featured on the filmâs soundtrack. âallmovie guide Cast: Dirk Bogarde, Romolo Valli, Mark Burns, Nora Ricci, Marisa Berenson, Carole AndrÃ©, BjÃ¶rn AndrÃ©sen, Silvana Mangano, Leslie French, Franco Fabrizi, Antonio Appicella",
