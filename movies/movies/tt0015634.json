      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The film debut for artist, activist, and professional football player Paul Robeson, Body and Soul follows an escaped convict who tries to pass himself off as a preacher in a small town. Before release, censors made director Oscar Micheaux cut nearly a third of the film to be \"fit for release\". Unfortunately the full version is now considered lost. Contemporary reviews don't seem to have survived for this silent picture, but modern reviews are mostly positive.  I've included both modern versions of the film, one by the Criterion Collection, with the other by Kino Lorber. ",

      "description": "     A minister is malevolent and sinister behind his righteous facade. He consorts with, and later extorts from, the owner of a gambling house, and betrays an honest girl, eventually driving them both to ruin.   Body and Soul , directed by the legendary African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, is a direct critique of the power of the cloth, casting Robeson in dual roles as a jackleg preacher and a well-meaning inventor.",
