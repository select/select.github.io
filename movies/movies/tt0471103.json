    "Plot": "This is quite an interesting old film, one of the hundreds made by the Northern partnership of Mitchell and Kenyon recently found in the cellar of a shop.Probably filmed on a weekend or bank holiday, it shows the good folk of Northern England enjoying some quality time on Blackpool's famous promenade. The main flaw of the film is that, instead of capturing people going about their usual business what we actually see for most of the film is a large bunch of people grinning inanely at the camera. Despite this, it's still fascinating to see our ancestors brought back to life for a few brief minutes.",
