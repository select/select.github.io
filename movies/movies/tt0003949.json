He and a rival for the girl's affections fight over the issue, the rival who does have a dress suit suitable for the occasion. Unable to get the money from his mother to rent a suit, Fatty manages to \"borrow\" the rival's suit. Despite the suit being too small, Fatty is able to put it on and go to the dance with his girl. However his rival won't tolerate Fatty's antics and decides to go to the dance and exact his own form of revenge against Fatty. Total mayhem ensues at the dance, with Fatty needing some help from a policeman to be \"decent\".",
