Unable to get the money from his mother to rent a suit, Fatty manages to \"borrow\" the rival's suit. Despite the suit being too small, Fatty is able to put it on and go to the dance with his girl. However his rival won't tolerate Fatty's antics and decides to go to the dance and exact his own form of revenge against Fatty.
