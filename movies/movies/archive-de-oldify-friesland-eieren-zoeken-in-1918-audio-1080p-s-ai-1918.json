      "description": "Friesland is one of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands. It lies in the North and borders the Waddenzee. Friesland is famous for its 11 cities skating competition (called \"De Elfstedentocht), which can only be occasionally held during years with hard winter conditions. Another popular event in Friesland is the search for the first \"Kievits-ei\" (Lapwing egg). In previous centuries the first person to find such an egg would take it home to show-off and to win a prize. Nowadays this practice is fortunately forbidden. This film shows Friezians undertaking a trip over Frieslands many lakes in search of birds eggs. There are some nice scenes of eggs starting to hatch. There is another (even nicer and more emotional) film about Friesland on my other channel. For copyright reasons it was not possible to show it on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_on14efU6k Don't forget to subscribe to both my channels! The original film has been motion-stabilized, speed corected, enhanced and colorized by means of modern A.I. software.",
