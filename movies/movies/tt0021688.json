    "Plot": "Bosko joins a wacky fox hunt. One of the hunters is an elephant, who is riding on a horse to be pitied. One of the hounds is a dachshund. Bosko's own horse must be made to swallow a log in order to keep his midsection from drooping to the ground. Meanwhile, the fox is utterly unconcerned. He lopes along, crossing the pond by stepping on the stones, and then using the floating logs as rafts. Eventually, Bosko's horse abandons his owner; but an overly friendly hound steps in to bring Bosko to his quarry. Both of them find more than they bargained for.",
