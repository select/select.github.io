      "description": "The Countryman and the Cinematograph (1901) Director: Robert W. Paul The Countryman and the Cinematograph (also known as The Countryman's First Sight of the Animated Pictures) is a 1901 British short silent comedy film, directed by Robert W. Paul, featuring a stereotypical yokel reacting to films projected onto a screen. The film \"is one of the earliest known examples of a film within a film\", where, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"the audience reaction to that film is as important a part of the drama as the content of the film itself\".[1] In 1902, a remake of the film, Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show, was produced at the Edison Company, directed by Edwin S. Porter.[2] -From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
