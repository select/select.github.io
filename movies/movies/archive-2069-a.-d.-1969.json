      "description": "Old black and white softcore set to smooth jazz and occasionally surf music.  A man gets a second chance to repair his love life by being sent back in time. Fortunately his underwear seems to follow him wherever he goes.  Not much of a plot and most of the dialog consists of groan and moans. Sadly this is not the full movie 75 minute movie only the first 53 minutes.",
