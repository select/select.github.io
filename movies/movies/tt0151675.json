    "Plot": "Lulu's daddy forces her to practice her violin when all she wants to do is play baseball with the boys. She sneaks out, but manages to get knocked unconscious when a ball hits her on the head. Suddenly, she is in dreamland - or rather, nightmare-land - when an anthropomorphic drum drags her to the Musical Court of Justice. Lulu is put on trial. The judge is a cello. The bailiff is a saxophone. The prosecutor is a clarinet. The complainant is Lulu's poor violin. The jury, ominously, is composed of no one but violins. The charge? \"Desertion of her violin!\" declares the prosecutor. At first, Lulu does not take the proceedings very seriously. But she soon finds that in a land of walking, talking musical instruments, mistreatment of a violin is a serious offense.",
