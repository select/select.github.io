      "description": "\"A Bride for Henry\" is a 1937 American film directed by William Nigh. When Sheila Curtis' (Anne Nagel) fiancé doesn't show up for the wedding, she drafts her lawyer, Henry Tuttle (Warren Hull), to stand in for the missing groom.\n\nWhen Eric Reynolds (Henry Mollison) finally shows up, after sleeping off the bachelor party, Shelia intends to get a quick divorce, and marry him, after the media attention dies down. Although, Henry has been in love with her for years, he gets fed up, and spends his time, on their \"Honeymoon\" with his old girlfriend, wealthy Helen Van Orden (Claudia Dell), and a bevy of beauties. Shelia soon gets jealous; and, realizes that Eric will always be unreliable; while, it's Henry she's always counted on, and loved; but, it might be too late. She might have taken Henry for granted for too long.\n\n---\n\nDirected by William Nigh, produced by Dorothy Davenport, screenplay by Marion Orth, story by Josephine Bentham, starring Anne Nagel as Sheila Curtis, Warren Hull as Henry Tuttle, Henry Mollison as Eric Reynolds, Claudia Dell as Helen Van Orden, Betty Ross Clarke as Mrs. Curtis and Harrison Greene as Constable.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"A Bride for Henry\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
