      "description": "\"Indiscreet\" is an American comedy film directed by Leo McCarey and starring Gloria Swanson and Ben Lyon. The screenplay by Buddy G. DeSylva, Lew Brown, and Ray Henderson, based on their story Obey That Impulse, originally was written as a full-fledged musical, but only two songs - \"If You Haven't Got Love\" and \"Come to Me\" - remained when the film was released.\n\nThe plot of the United Artists release centers on fashion designer Geraldine Trent (Swanson), who takes up with novelist Tony Blake (Lyon) after leaving her former beau Jim Woodward because of his many indiscretions with other women. Tony has indicated he has no interest in dating a woman with a past, so Geraldine remains mum about her affair with Jim, until her younger sister Joan arrives and announces she's engaged—to Jim. Madcap complications ensue as Geraldine tries to keep her secret from Tony while convincing her sister to rid herself of her womanizing fiancé in favor of simple country boy Buster Collins.\n\n---\n\nDirected by Leo McCarey, produced by Lew Brown, Buddy G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson, written by Buddy G. DeSylva (story & scenario), Lew Brown (story & scenario), Ray Henderson (story & scenario) and Leo McCarey, starring Gloria Swanson\nand Ben Lyon.\n\n---\n\nSource: \"Indiscreet (1931 film)\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.
