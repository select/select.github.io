      "description": "The Devil's Partner is a 1958 American film starring Ed Nelson, directed by Charles R. Rondeau and produced by Hugh Hooker, an actor and stuntman who had previously made the 1958 film The Littlest Hobo. However the film was not released until 1961 when it was acquired by Roger and Gene Corman's Filmgroup and released as a double feature with Creature from the Haunted Sea. The film was co-written by actor Stanley Clements and Laura Jean Mathews. Plot: An old hermit (Ed Nelson) who lived outside of dusty Furnace Flats, N.M., dies, and his nephew, Nick (also Nelson), arrives in town. Everyone likes Nick at first, especially pretty Nell Lucas (Jean Allison), who used to deliver milk to his uncle. But strange things start happening in town: A man dies of poisoned goat milk; Nell's fiancé, David (Richard Crane), is horribly mauled by a dog; and the town drunk winds up dead. Everyone has reason to suspect Nick because he is a warlock.",
