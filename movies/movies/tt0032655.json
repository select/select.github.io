      "description": "This noirish romance stars Ingrid Bergman as a shy young woman who is shot by her lover. Following his trial, she begins a new life in Stockholm under an assumed identity, working at a pharmacy and making new friends at the rooming house where she takes up residence. Both a grim exposé of sexual politics and a sensual romance,  June Night  features a remarkably intense performance from Bergman as a woman weighed down by a secret—symbolized by a scar near her heart—who learns to fall in love again.",
