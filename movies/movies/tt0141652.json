    "Plot": "Having run out of nickels to cheat at pinball, the villain goes to Little Nell's ranch. Either pay up or marry him!It's one of the cartoons that Ub Iwerks' studio, which had been foundering since they had lost their contract with MGM a few years earlier, made for distribution by Columbia, whose cartoon production was floundering due to the illness of and eventual death of Charles Mintz. Neither organization would do well. Iwerks would give up and go back to Disney, whom he had left in 1930, fed up at the lack of credit. He would spend the rest of his career doing technical work, earning the studio Oscars. Columbia's cartoon production would also flounder, with half a dozen heads of cartoon production until they farmed out cartoons to UPA in the mid-1940s.It's a moderately fun cartoon, but everyone was doing parodies of melodramas, a dying theatrical form.",
