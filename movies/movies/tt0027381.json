    "Plot": "World War I, apparently. There is a series of quick blackout gags, including a soldier that throws the pin, is blown sky-high by the grenade, and is caught in a net by an ambulance driver; one soldier's encounters with very smart bullets; a machine gunner with the jitters. Porky leads a charge, but with no support from his company, he runs back and dives under Beans' bunk. After a quick chorus of \"You're in the Army Now,\" a messenger pigeon drops in with news that General Hardtack is being held prisoner. They dash off in a motorcycle/sidecar, chased by another smart bullet, and arrive in the nick of time to dispatch the general's captors. They fly off in a plane and get shot down to end up together in the hospital.",
