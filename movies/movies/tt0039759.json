      "description": "There isn't so much story here that it gets in the way of the music. If you're a Louis Jordan fan, this one's for you. This one's all about the music, with three full Louis Jordan swing numbers before the storyline even starts. In a 67-minute running you get 14 songs by Louis with his Tympany Five, June Richmond, Mabel Lee, and Bea Griffith.",
