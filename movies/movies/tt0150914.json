    "Plot": "Krazy Kat and Kitty are tooling along the highway in their boat-tailed roadster.This one is packed full of gags, mostly very cartoony ones about automobiles, including jalopies and one old, cheap car with an axle that extends to the side to block any car trying to pass it. There are also gags about the weather and California's supposed sunny weather. Although the gags are good, it appears they were either running out of creativity or money, because there is considerable looping here, repetition of sequences that meant frames could be repeated, rather than drawing new ones.",
