      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the previously available IA copies.   “A little gem” “Better than you’d expect” “Phantom is good fun” “Underrated grade B sci fi” “Boring 50s sci fi” (IMDB reviews quotes). A micro-budget science fiction romp with an unusual plot and a solid cast of competent B-feature actors. Proof that you don’t need mega-bucks to produce an entertaining little film that works. IMDB rating 4.1. Produced & directed by W Lee Wilder Released in 1953. Complete print. CAST NOTE: Rudolph Anders (Dr Wyatt) also played the evil Nazi scientist (Col. Karl Osler) with the hots for Irish McCalla in the jaw-dropping “She Demons.” It’s available here at IA in the Feature Films Collection. https://archive.org/details/SheDemons",
