      "description": "The Daily Clarion hires detective story writer Steve Colt (Bruce Edwards) to investigate the deaths of a group of scientists working on an atomic rocket development project. Behind the killings is fortune teller Sombra (Carol Forman), a spy from an Asian country intent on world domination, who is determined to pilfer the atomic rocket by luring workers from the project to her parlor and killing them with black widow spider venom when they refuse to cooperate. With Virginia Lee, Ramsay Ames, Anthony Warde, and I. Stanford Jolley. 13 chapter cliffhanger serial I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
