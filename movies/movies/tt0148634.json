    "Plot": "It takes about 80 seconds of this cartoon from Scrappy staring blankly at the cover of LEARN TO PLAY THE PIANO IN TWELVE LESSONS to being an accomplished player of barrelhouse rag tunes. Fortunately, bratty Oopie is there to distract him.Aside from the pleasant score by longtime Mintz employee Joe De Nat, there isn't that much about pianos in this. The gags mostly concern the distractions. SOme of them are pretty good, even though this series had long before lost the odd kid's viewpoint that made it unique in the early 1930s, under originator Dick Huemer. Now, however, he was working for Disney.",
