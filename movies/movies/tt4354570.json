    "Plot": "Jasper 'Buck' Livingston made a decision early in his life that influenced and changed the cowboy culture. Through failure and disappointment he learned that although one person cannot change the world, it takes only one to start. Buck strategizes his life purpose one cowboy at a time. Woven within the film is Buck's incredible life journey as a rodeo cowboy, rancher father, and preacher. It's an exhilarating and emotional true-life story of an ordinary man from north Texas who served an extraordinary purpose. The film depicts the grueling travels of the rodeo circuit, from the backbreaking bull riding to the musical oasis of the honky-tonks. It portrays both the picturesque culture of the American rancher while dispensing cowboy pride and simplistic life solutions. Just as 32 nails attach the shoes to a horse; 'Nail 32' clenches the importance of men being courageous, honorable, and truly God fearing! As each nail serves a purpose; each life matters. Can a cowboy be a Christian and can a Christian be a cowboy? Either way you answer it, 'Nail 32' encourages all men to find the Lord before you need Him, and never, ever sell out your pride or saddle - 'Cause life's a long, long ride'.",
