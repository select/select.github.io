      "description": "Violence at Noon  concerns the odd circumstances surrounding a horrific murder and rape spree. In a twist, the film is as much about the two women who protect the violent man—his wife and a former victim—as it is about him. Containing more than two thousand cuts and a wealth of inventive widescreen compositions, this coolly fragmented character study is a mesmerizing investigation of criminality and social decay.",

As the film starts, Eisuke encounters Shino, who works as a maid in a house. She is a former coworker from a failed collective farm, whose life he once saved - only to rape her. Soon, Eisuke's criminal pattern of rapes and murders emerges as he goes on assaulting women. Shino witnesses of one of them, as Eisuke tries to violate her employer. When cooperating with the police on making a description of the rapist, Shino withholds her crucial knowledge of his identity. She prefers writing letters to Eisuke's dutiful wife, Matsuko, a schoolteacher, in order to expose his true nature and perhaps induce her into turning Eisuke over to the police.",
