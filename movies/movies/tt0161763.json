    "Plot": "Paul Terry's staff moves into its strongest period with one of its standard works: a synchronized cartoon with a musical theme. It's German-themed music and the concepts and gags are surprisingly strong and adult.The basics are the theme of the Lorelei; it's hardly surprising. Based on the German legends, there are visual references to the Ring cycle and to anything even vaguely Germanic, including Rip Van Winkle.The effect is a grab bag that suggests a PG rated Fleischer cartoon of the era. Even the Lorelei has a Fleischer air, as she sings in a Helen Kane voice reminiscent of Betty Boop. If that isn't particularly original, Terry's wasn't the only cartoon factory to do that.",
