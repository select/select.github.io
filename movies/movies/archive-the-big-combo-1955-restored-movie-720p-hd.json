      "description": "The Big Combo is a 1955 American crime film noir directed by Joseph H. Lewis , written by Philip Yordan and photographed by cinematographer John Alton , with music by David Raksin . The film stars Cornel Wilde , Richard Conte and Brian Donlevy , as well as Jean Wallace , who was Wilde's wife at the time. The supporting cast features Lee Van Cleef , Earl Holliman and the final screen appearance of actress Helen Walker . The Big Combo received positive reviews from critics.
