      "description": "The Cook’s Revenge (1900) 'La vengeance du gâte-sauce' Director: Georges Méliès The Cook's Revenge (French: La Vengeance du gâte-sauce) is a 1900 French silent trick film by Georges Méliès. Production and survival: Méliès himself plays the cook, one of his many roles in which he loses his head or has several duplicate heads. The special effects are created with substitution splices and multiple exposures on a black background. The Cook's Revenge was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 243 in its catalogues.Long presumed lost, a print of the film was eventually rediscovered in Manosque by the son of a fairground exhibitor, and sold to Méliès's granddaughter, Madeleine Malthête-Méliès.",
