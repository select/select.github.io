      "description": "Synopsis For this film adaptation of Peter Shafferâs Broadway hit, director Milos Forman returned to the city of Prague that heâd left behind during the Czech political crises of 1968, bringing along his usual cinematographer and fellow Czech expatriate, Miroslav Ondricek. Amadeus is an expansion of a Viennese âurban legendâ concerning the death of 18th-century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the vantage point of an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart (Tom Hulce) first gained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young snipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieriâso disciplined, so devoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiorsânot touched by God? Unable to match Mozartâs talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstartâs career. Disguising himself as a mysterious benefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking âRequiem,â which eventually costs Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the filmâs many pearls of dialogue, the best line goes to the Emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition on the grounds that it has âtoo many notes.â Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for F. Murray Abraham. In 2002, the film received a theatrical re-release as âAmadeus: The Directorâs Cut,â a version that includes 20 minutes of additional footage. âallmovie guide Cast: F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice, Simon Callow, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Charles Kay, Kenny Baker, Lisabeth Bartlett, Cynthia Nixon, Vincent Schiavelli",

    "Plot": "Antonio Salieri believes that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music is divine and miraculous. He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II. But he's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart. He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical mediocrity.",
