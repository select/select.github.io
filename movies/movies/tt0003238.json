    "Plot": "On his way to his wedding Krause meets some friends in front of a grocery store, who, for a joke, sprinkle his bouquet of flowers with red pepper. The bride, the minister and the guests smell the flowers and are thrown into spasms of sneezing. In despair, Krause runs away. He meets a pretty girl in the park and drives her escort away, deciding that he likes this girl better than the homely one he was to marry. The escort hires two thugs to attack Krause, who is given a thrashing and his coat and vest taken away. He rushes away and attracts the attention of the police who think he is crazy and pursue him. In his efforts to escape Krause tweaks up a picnic party, and has many accidents. Hard pressed, he runs to the roof of a house and drops down the chimney. It happens to be the home of his waiting bride, and when the police follow him down the chimney and arrest him she comes to his rescue and drives the bluecoats out. Krause accepts his fate, and an amusing reconciliation takes place.",
