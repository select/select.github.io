      "description": "The FBI's daring and resourceful Operator 99 (Martin Lamont) goes into action, assisted by his gal Friday (Helen Talbot), when a criminal mastermind (George J. Lewis) escapes custody and along with his lieutenants (Lorna Gray and Hal Taliaferro) embarks on a series of daring thefts involving lots of chases and stunts with cars, motorcycles and airplanes. A 12-chapter cliffhanger serial. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
