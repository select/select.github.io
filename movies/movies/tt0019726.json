Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, this vintage drama unfolds in the glittering shadows of Broadway, where ambition collides with crime and love becomes a dangerous game.\n\nA chorus girl chasing stardom finds herself caught in a sizzling love triangle between her dependable stage manager and a charming but dangerous bootlegger. Packed with Jazz Age flair, speakeasy style, and dramatic tension, this early talkie delivers classic musical numbers alongside bold storytelling—hallmarks of Pre-Code Hollywood.\n\nAlice White dazzles in the lead role, backed by standout turns from Sally Eilers and Marion Byron.
