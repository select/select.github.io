Receiving a severe rebuke, the boy resolves to avenge himself, and going out on the public road he purchases a supply of itch pollen, which he slyly blows down the necks of the various guests. The result is a severe itching of the cuticle, and the entire party soon experience great discomfiture, to the delight of the bad boy. Many ludicrous experiences witnessed throughout the festivities.",
