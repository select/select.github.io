    "Plot": "In his career, De Wolf Hopper recited Ernest Lawrence Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat\" thousands of times. Here, wearing a tuxedo, he emerges from behind a curtain as if at a theater, gives a short introduction, and launches into the poem. The camera is stationary, and although Hopper stands in one place, his hands and arms, his face, and his voice are animated throughout. In delivery, it's a minstrel performance.",
