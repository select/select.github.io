    "Plot": "Both \"Alkali\" and \"Mustang\" Pete loved Betty Brown, and the lady had her hands full in keeping the lovers from shooting each other. One day \"Alkali\" called on Betty with a pair of handsome saddle horses and asked her to go riding with him. She agreed, but the resourceful \"Mustang,\" driving up with a handsome horse and carriage, carried off the lady. \"Alkali\" goes to the village inn, inclined to drink himself to death, but finally trades for an old junk automobile his two horses, and clambering in the seat, starts in pursuit of his rival and the lady. Overtaking them, he has no difficulty in persuading Betty to ride with him. But the auto breaks down and \"Alkali,\" endeavoring to fix it, turns on the juice and the rattle-trap car starts down the trail at lightning speed, leaving \"Alkali\" behind. After a thrilling and exciting ride the car is ditched and poor Betty is thrown headlong into the road.",
