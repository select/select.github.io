Hell-bent on making them pay in blood, Tom embarks on a life-or-death quest to avenge his family, relentlessly pursuing the leader and his jackals in the unforgiving desert. As Tom crosses paths with Isaac, a compassionate prospector who has reasons to see McClain and his bandits suffer, he sets in motion his deadly campaign, methodically picking the perpetrators off with his ingenious traps. Is one ever too young for vengeance?",
