    "Plot": "A cat is playing with mice, sticking them in a crate marked \"Concentration Camp\" until they decide to get together to deal with the situation in this color Terrytoon.As usual with the cartoons that Paul Terry produced during his career, this one is up to the standards of the era; all the technical issues are well handled and the idea of the mice joining the army to fight the cat is a good one for 1942... although why they seem to be wearing Mountie uniforms is unclear to me It's the sort of cartoon that Terry made time after time, a variation on the Mouse that Belled the Cat. All that's needed is a cartoon star, perhaps one modeled on a popular comic book, radio show and competing cartoon series... well, maybe the next time some cat is beating up on a mouse in a Terrytoon, they'll come up with something.",
