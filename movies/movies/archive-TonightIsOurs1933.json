      "description": "This is a 1833 restored public domain movie starring Claudette Colbert, Fredric March, and Alison Skipworth.  The script was based on the 1927 play \"The Queen was in the Parlor\" by Noel Coward.  It was restored from a rough DVD copy. The plot concerns a princess who falls in low with a commoner, which conflicts with her duty to marry another man.  Because it is a pre-code movie, the princess can be frank about her sexual history.  The film would probably now be G rated with no profanity or nudity and only some tame violence. The cast includes: Claudette Colbert as Princess Nadya Fredric March as Sabien Pastal Alison Skipworth as Grand Duchess Emilie Arthur Byron as Gen. Krish Paul Cavanagh as Prince Keri Ethel Griffies as Zana Clay Clement as Seminoff Warburton Gamble as Alex Edwin Maxwell as mob leader (from Wikipedia)",
