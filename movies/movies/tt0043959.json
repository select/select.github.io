Jim Zimmerman, a fugitive murderer from Huntsville Prison disguised as a Deputy, and three other ruthless escapees take over the station, intent on robbing the next day's gold shipment. After murdering Sam, Zimmerman knows they must keep Tom alive in order to complete their plans. Owens does not correct Zimmmerman's assumption that Vinnie is his wife, correctly sensing that the misconception might be the key to her survival as well.",
