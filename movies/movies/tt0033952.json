      "description": "Blues in the Night is a 1941 American musical in the FILM NOlR style  directed by Anatole Litvak and starring Priscilla Lane, Richard Whorf, Betty Field, Lloyd Nolan, Elia Kazan, and Jack Carson. The film was nominated for a Best Song Oscar for its principal musical number \"Blues in the Night\".   Is an unusual film which often manages to juxtapose scenes of light-hearted musical comedy with dark, murderous moments. It was not financially successful as its East Coast release took place shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film has since achieved a small cult following, including The Simpsons creator Matt Groening.",

Mistletoe is his final refuge before he must escape to the outdoors just ahead of Tom's claws.
