      "description": "This was the first comedy that Laurel and Hardy starred in without producer Hal Roach, although they had previously been \"guest stars\" in four MGM movies. After they finished making \"The Flying Deuces,\" they returned to Hal Roach Studios to make films. In order to make this movie, producer Boris Morros bought the rights to the 1931 French film \"Les deux legionnaires,\" which had a similar plot. \"The Flying Deuces\" was Morros' first independent production and it was shot in continuity over a span of four weeks. Only one day was reportedly needed for retakes. The French original starred Fernandel and Noel Noel. SYNOPSIS: Ollie is in love with a woman. When he find out that she is already married, he tries to kill himself. Of course, the suicide is prevented and the boys join the Foreign Legion to get away from their troubles. Eventually, they are arrested for trying to desert the Legion and escape the firing squad by stealing a plane.",

      "description": "This print is much sharper and cleaner than the existing IA copy. Heartbroken looser in love Olly joins the French Foreign Legion to forget, and of course he drags along Stan who forgets everything. One of the funniest L&H feature-length comedies with great slapstick routines and magical moments like Stan playing \"The World is Waiting for the Sunrise\" on a bedspring while he and Olly are waiting to be shot at dawn. A must-see for all fans of the eternally hapless duo. Directed by A Edward Sutherland. Released in 1939 a.k.a.\"Flying Aces\" TRIVIA: Oliver Hardy met his future wife, Virginia Lucille Jones, on the set. She was the script supervisor. PERSONAL NOTE: The first time I saw this film the ending made me cry. I was too young to get the reincarnation joke.",
