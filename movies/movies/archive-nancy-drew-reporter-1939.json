      "description": "As part of a school assignment, Nancy emulates a newspaper repoter at an inquest. She decides that the young woman accused of the crime is not guilty, and enlists her neighbor Ted Nickerson in helping her find the real murderer. Bonita Granville as Nancy Drew John Litel as Carson Drew Frankie Thomas as Ted Nickerson Dickie Jones as Killer Parkins Mary Lee as Mary Larry Williams as Miles Lambert Betty Amann as Eula Denning Thomas E. Jackson as Bostwick - City Editor Olin Howland as Police Sgt. Entwhistle Sheila Bromley as Bonnie Lucas I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
