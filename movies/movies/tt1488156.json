McGowan from a story by Edward T. Matlack, is a short action film from a serial by the name of \"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Holmes.  This is episode 26 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917.  The first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson.  They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick thinking.  Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest ever.  Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976: \"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Nearing a river trestle under repair, she hurtles into the river; undaunted, she swims to the opposite bank and flags down the excursion train in the nick of time, causing the engineer to run his train onto a siding just a few moments before the runaway dashes by.",
