    "Plot": "Sid Marcus and Art Davis start off this lively cartoon starring Mintz' Scrappy with a lot of gags, some of them pretty gross to the modern eye, but all the funnier for that: hemorrhoidal mules, people straining mud through beards and teeth in order to catch the grains of gold and, of course, Scrappy himself, who wears a derby like Charley Chaplin or Stan Laurel and doffs it on appropriate occasions. The scenes set in the other typical gold-mining movie site, the saloon, are likewise chockablock with visual jokes.The gags are fine and the staff pulls them off in rapid fire, sure to keep people entertained -- and probably unaware of the looping that goes on constantly. The ending is a bit of a let down, and fairly typical for someone looking to end the gags. The rest of the movie, however, keeps up interest.",
