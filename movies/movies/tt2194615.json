    "Plot": "Thie is indeed a decent documentary but my eyes were glued for a time on that cooking-pot and I couldn't help feeling that there was a scene missing from the film that would famously later be provided by Mel Brooks in Blazing Saddles.I frankly rather doubt if it was made in 1912. Stylistically it looks like a film from the twenties, the golden age of the dude ranch.",
