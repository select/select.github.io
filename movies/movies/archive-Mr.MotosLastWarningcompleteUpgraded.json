      "description": "This complete print is brighter and significantly sharper than the truncated version already here at IA. Bad guys want to blow up the French fleet at Port Said. Mr. Moto would rather they didn't. Urban adventure ensues, along with a side order of comedy relief. Initially released on 20 January 1939. IMDB page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031678/",
