      "description": "A strange man, Johnny First, arrives in a small Western town. He doesn’t drink whiskey, doesn’t shoot with or without reason, he organizes movie shows in the saloon. The town is being transformed. Mesmerizing new art elevates the simple, raw souls of cowboys. And Johnny himself finds here his only and great love - Diana. However, the noble hero is hampered by hostile forces - a bartender who is losing his clients, a pastor who is an unlucky admirer of Diana, and Mr. Second, who introduces viewers to low-grade cruel films.\n\nIMDb rating: 7.6\n\nYear of production: 1987\n\nDirector: Surikova Alla\nScreenwriter: Akopov Eduard\nComposer: Gladkov Gennady\nOperator: Belenkiy Grigory\nProduction designer: Evgeniy Markovich\n\nCast: Kvasha Igor, Mironov Andrey, Anofriev Oleg, Polskikh Galina, Tabakov Oleg, Ivanov Boris, Boyarsky Mikhail, Krachkovskaya Natalya, Yarmolnik Leonid, Durov Lev, Fateeva Natalya, Karachentsov Nikolay, Pavlov Alexander, Brondukov Borislav, Yakovleva Alexandra, Medvedev Yuri , Farada Semyon, Svetin Mikhail, Filozov Albert, Mishulin Spartak, Tabakov Anton, Inshakov Alexander, Kherkheulidze Mikhail, Malyshev Alexander",
