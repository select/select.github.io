    "Plot": "I watched this short film a few times on YouTube. Different from the original version, the cartoon shown there was presented in its alternate title Alaska Daze. The real title to this was hinted to me by a user of the website who commented on it. After that, I made a brief research on the web, and I figured that user was right.The animators of this cartoon certainly made good choices of what music to use. Also what's shown there gives a good message that a lot of fun things can be done in the snow. The story features Krazy and his girlfriend (I just wonder what animal is she) do some ice skating on an outdoor rink.",
