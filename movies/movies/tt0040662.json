      "description": "Oliver Twist is a 1948 British film and the second of David Lean's two film adaptations of Charles Dickens novels.  Following his 1946 version of Great Expectations, Lean re-assembled much of the same team for his adaptation of Dickens' 1838 novel, including producers Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan, cinematographer Guy Green, designer John Bryan and editor Jack Harris. Lean's then-wife, Kay Walsh, who had collaborated on the screenplay for Great Expectations, played the role of Nancy. In the 1948 film \"Oliver Twist,\" directed by David Lean, a young orphan named Oliver escapes from a cruel workhouse and travels to London, where he meets a group of juvenile thieves led by the sinister Fagin. As Oliver navigates a world of crime and danger, he seeks a true home and ultimately discovers his identity and family ties.",
