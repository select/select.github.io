      "description": "This is a simulation of a double feature program at a second-run movie house in the 1940s. The sleuthing begins with coming attractions and a cartoon, followed by the first feature, Sherlock Holmes in \"Terror by Night.\" The intermission featurette is a true crime short, \"Night Intruder,\" followed by the second feature, Charlie Chan in \"Dark Alibi.\" (There are a few seats left in the balcony.) STREAMING SPECIAL NOTICE; I rederived the MPEG4 (MP4) file. It now streams normally without any audio or video dropouts. NOTE: All the items in this simulation are available separately in various IA collections.",
