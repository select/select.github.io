    "Plot": "A teenage girl and her mom think Crestwick will be a great place for them to have a new beginning but little do they know, the house they are moving into has been plagued by an evil demon known as Nefas dating back into the 1800's. Nefas has fed on the souls of innocent young girls and now has a new target. In order to save this teenage girl and her mother, a skeptical, small town doctor is forced to confront his own demons before another girl suffers a gruesome fate in his family's old house. The film was inspired from real events from the 1870's and has been updated to give a fresh perspective on possession and the pure evil that Nefas has been known to bring.",
