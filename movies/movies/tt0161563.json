    "Plot": "Farmer Al Falfa lets the cat out for the night, winds the clock and goes to bed. The mice take advantage of the situation to throw a party in this pleasantly amusing Terrytoon.Although there is little to point to, the progress of events points to a real story punctuated by gags and music, rather than a series of gags connected by a plot and music. That is a key advance from the \"synchronized music\" cartoon that Terry's studio had been making through the end of 1931. The distinction is a subtle one, and may be difficult to analyze, but it is a matter of pacing. It also argues that Terry's musical director, Philip Scheib, had become more than a technician. He was a full creative partner and Terry's staff adapted to his presence to make a better cartoon.",
