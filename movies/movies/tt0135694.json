      "description": "This is a B-western with an all-black cast that includes Spencer Williams and Mantan Moreland. Mantan's part isn't large, but he does have some very telling moments. Unfortunately this print represents the poor state of preservation of many surviving race films. Written and Directed by Richard C Kahn. Released in 1938. Approximately 4 minutes are missing. SPECIAL NOTE: The copyright notice in the opening credits refers to content not included here. This film is in the public domain. CAST NOTE: The multi-talented actor/writer/director/producer Spencer Williams (Butch Carter) is probably best known for his role as Andy in the \"Amos 'n Andy\" TV series (1951-55) He is here at IA in \"Son of Ingagi\" for which he also wrote the story and screenplay. As if all this wasn't enough, Williams also was a Jazz and popular music composer. He was inducted into The Songwriters Hall of Fame for \"Basin Street Blues\" and a long string of other hits.",
