      "description": "The Man Who Wouldn't Die is a 1942 American comedy horror mystery film directed by Herbert I. Leeds, starring Lloyd Nolan and Marjorie Weaver . This movie was the fifth of a series of seven of the Michael Shayne movies produced by Twentieth Century Fox between 1940 and 1942. The original source material was a novel by Clayton Rawson that featured his magician-sleuth the Great Merlini. However, in the film, the sleuth was changed to Michael Shayne, a private detective created by Brett Halliday, though the Great Merlini was retained as a minor character.",
