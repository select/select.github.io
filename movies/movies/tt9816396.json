The school's student council president is Miyuki Shirogane, and their student council vice-president is Kaguya Shinomiya. They are attracted to each other but do not confess their feelings for each other due to their stubborn pride. About half a year has passed since they have kept their feelings private. Now, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya think the person who confesses first will be the loser. They both think of ways to make the other person confess first.
