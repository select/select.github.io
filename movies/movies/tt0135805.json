They ride with Ann and Jeff is surprised to see that the Roberts' are living on what was formerly his uncle's ranch. The Roberts had only been there a short time, had never met Jim Blanchard, and after buying the ranch from Cobb Allen (Al Ferguson) learned they had no water rights. Billy also learns that other ranchers such as Dave Barlow (Edward Peil Sr.) had also bought ranches from Cobb, but that Cobb had diverted the stream that ran through the ranches and was now trying to force them to buy water from him. Billy and Jeff go to the barricade Cobb has around the water and after a fight with Allen-henchmen Bragg (Kenne Duncan), Mason and Baker, the water is turned back into its original channel.",
