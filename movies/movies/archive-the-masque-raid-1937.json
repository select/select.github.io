      "description": "Krazy Kat is a night watchman at the Colossal Costume Co. during a fierce rain and lightning storm. Inside, there's a lineup of apparent wax museum-type characters with costumes. Thinking that he hears a disturbance, Krazy takes his dog and flashlight and tours the place. All appears OK, so Krazy Kat and his dog go back to their table-and-chair \"post,\" where they both take a nap, and then Krazy Kat has a dream.
