Sheriff's department has Steve Nordstrom being released from prison after serving a sentence for a dance-hall assault on Carl Fowler for insulting Steve's girlfriend Harriet Owens. Steve is given time off for good behavior and is out on probation thanks to the efforts on his behalf by Lieutenant Andy Doyle. One night, after taking a truck-driving job, Steve is waylaid by the revengeful Fowler and is savagely beaten, causing him to lose his memory. Wandering aimlessly around, he meets genial businessman Morton Ramsey who hires him to work around his house as a handyman. Ramsey's wife Claire is having an affair and is planning to have her husband murdered, and sees an opportunity to frame Steve for the murder. He plan works, and all the evidence is against the memory-clouded Steve when Ramsey is found dead.",
