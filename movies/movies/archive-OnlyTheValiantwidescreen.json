      "description": "1951 directed by Gordon Douglas starring Gregory Peck, Ward Bond, Neville Brand, Gig Y oung, Lon Chaney Jr., Jeff Corey, Warner Anderson, Barbara Payton, Steve Brodie, Dan Riss and Michael Ansara. Captain Richard (Dick) Lance (ahem!) is blamed for the death of popular Lieutenant, after he is sent on a dangerous mission intended for the Captain. (The Company thinks the Captain changed the orders to spare himself but it was actually the Colonel). When the Captain then concocts the desperate mission of defending a narrow pass from a dilapidated outpost with the intention of blocking the evil Apaches from attacking the main fort, (which is poorly defended) Dick chooses the shabbiest men in the Company, who all hate him. Engaging cavalry western with a first-rate cast, produced by William Cagney, (Jimmy's brother).",
