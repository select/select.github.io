Claude Rains as Dr. Jack Griffin aka The Invisible Man Gloria Stuart as Flora Cranley William Harrigan as Dr. Arthur Kemp Henry Travers as Dr. Cranley Una O'Connor as Jenny Hall Forrester Harvey as Herbert Hall Holmes Herbert as Chief of Police E.E. Clive as Constable Jaffers I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
