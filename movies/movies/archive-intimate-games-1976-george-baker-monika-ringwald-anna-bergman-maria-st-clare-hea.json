      "description": "A psychology teacher assigns his university class a project about personal fantasies. Basically an excuse to get a lot of women naked on film and it succeeds at that. Note that Marilyn Rickard is credited with Monika Ringwald in the film. Amusingly Marilyn's IMDb page says not to confuse her with the British actress Marilyn Rickard of whom there is no mention.  ",
