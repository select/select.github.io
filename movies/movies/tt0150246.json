    "Plot": "Krazy Kat and Kitty are dancing down the street. They come across a curio shop and look into its window, where they see a lot of Chinese-looking objects. Gazing at a screen, they imagine themselves in a Chinese setting, where she is an aristocrat and he pulls a rickshaw.The principal thing to admire about Krazy Kat in this period is the fullness of its artwork. They did not, lke Disney, strive for realism, but took full advantage of the \"squash-and-squeeze\" animation of the era, full character design and, here at least, aborate background work.",
