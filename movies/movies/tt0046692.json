    "Plot": "Robert Ryan and Brian Keith, vastly under-rated actors, take a B-potboiler and make it appear to actually be something more. Matt Baker, a ne'er-do-well adventurer, gets out of jail and skips/sails away on his boat without paying for the storage and repairs. Back in his hometown, he is hired by his old friend Jim Kimmerly, head of the Salmon fishermen who have formed a canning cooperative, and are battling against an organized gang that rob the fishing traps regularly. Matt gets into a jam and needs money, so he joins the raiders, although his friend Jim, unaware of his duplicity, keeps covering for him among the other fishermen. The two men are also vying for the favors of Nicky.",
