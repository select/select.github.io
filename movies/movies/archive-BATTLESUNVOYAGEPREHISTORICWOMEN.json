      "description": "A COMPLETE DVD. To burn, download the zipped folder, extract the VIDEO TS folder, and burn onto a blank disc. Menu features either a still or poster art from one of the movies and audio derived from previous projects. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This double-bill feature a pair of Russian sci-fi flicks that Roger Corman got a hold of and \"Americanized\" by dubbing, cutting, and adding new scenes. The said new scenes in BATTLE were directed by Francis Ford Coppola and the ones in VOYAGE were directed by Peter Bogdonovich under a pseudonym. These flicks probably didn't run together back in the day, but I thought they were kind of a match because they have much in common. Cut together from stuff that's already here. Enjoy!",
