    "Plot": "A young deaf and mute man is constantly excluded from his environment. He is not taken seriously by anyone. This changes his behavior, the roots of which lie in a terrible childhood trauma. He begins to live out his craving for corpses, has had necrophilic tendencies since childhood and and eventually he develops a cruel urge to kill. While the police are unsuccessfully looking for the corpse abuser, who has given himself the name Mosquito, he develops a fascination for his (still) very lively, doll-like neighbor.",
