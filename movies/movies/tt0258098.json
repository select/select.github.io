    "Plot": "The camera is positioned so that it looks out to sea on a day when the waters are rough and the waves are high. As the waves come towards the shore, they are partially broken up by some rocks in front of the field of view. Even after passing the rocks, plenty of water and foam kicks up just in front of the camera.",
