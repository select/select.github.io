      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This part-talkie romantic dramedy follows two New Yorkers who meet, fall in love, and then lose track of each other over a 24 hour period. Contemporary critics praised the direction but faulted the simple plot. Modern reviews think of this film as one of the great pictures that was released during the transition between silent and fully talking movies. ",
