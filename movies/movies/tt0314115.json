    "Plot": "Funniest movie I've ever seen, although the ending is a little odd. The first half is the funniest. The ensemble work and pantomime is beyond perfect. I suppose it's genetic. (Lupino works with his brother in this.) Certainly proves that you can be hysterically funny without locker- room humour. Today's performers pale in comparison with the silent comedians when they were at their best like this. We really need someone to restore this film and give it a Grade A sound track. But Bob Vaughn is dead... Maybe Robert Israel could record this in front of a live audience for us? (His pre-recorded soundtracks lack the life he gives in live performance.)",
