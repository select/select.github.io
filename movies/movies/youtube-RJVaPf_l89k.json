      "description": "Movie Class by PizzaFLIX: The Spaghetti Western, aptly named for its Italian origin and extra marinara sauce for its gratuitous bloodshed. This genre came into prominence after the world-wide success of Sergio Leone’s A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS which introduced the Antihero to westerns. Played by Clint Eastwood as the “Man with No Name,” this character was morally ambiguous, not the heroic savior of traditional Hollywood westerns. These films were usually Italo-Spanish co-productions. Italy’s famed Cinecittà Studios handled technical production, directing and writing, and various film companies in Spain were used for the location shooting in the desert region of Almería which closely resembles the American West.\n\nPizzaFLIX WIDESCREEN edition\nStars: George Hilton, Charles Southwood, Agata Flori \nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo\n\nA revolutionary hires a mysterious gunfighter to take down emperor Maximilian by seizing a purse of jewels intended to be used to purchase weapons. (a.k.a. Mi chiamano Alleluja)",
