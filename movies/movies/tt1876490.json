    "Plot": "Jay C. Flippen finished out his career as a major supporting actor, particularly in westerns, playing the big, bluff hail-fellow-well-met sort of character who turned out to be a bully and a coward in the final reel. But before that he had a long career in vaudeville, and this is a record of his act.It may be a bit of a shock to see this piece as his roots were clearly in the minstrel show and his pacing clearly reflects this, rolling a cigar back and forth in his fingers, taking the occasional puff -- in mannerism much like George Burns, but in highly mannered language. His timing and jokes are also a bit old-fashioned, but spot on for the era. An excellent record but for specialists only.",
