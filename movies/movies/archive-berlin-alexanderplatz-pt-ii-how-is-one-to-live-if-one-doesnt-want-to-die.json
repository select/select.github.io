      "description": "Franz is self-employed hawking necktie holders on the street, but has trouble making enough money and does not consider himself an orator. After turning down the opportunity to sell sex education manuals, he is talked into selling the Nazi newspaper Völkischer Beobachter and wearing a swastika armband. In the subway, Franz is confronted by an old Jewish acquaintance selling hot sausages, but denies being antisemitic , and Dreske with two other men also known to him. Dreske admires Lenin and the Soviet Union , but Franz responds by decrying revolution and 'their' Weimar Republic . At Max's bar, Dreske and his friends sing \" The Internationale ” to provoke Franz, to which he responds by singing the 19th-century patriotic songs \" The Watch on the Rhine and \" Ich hatt' einen Kameraden \". At the top of his voice, Franz accuses them of being loudmouths and crooks, before almost collapsing. The other men return to their table. Outside, Franz meets Lina. He rambles about what has just happened; the men he has just met cannot understand life and do not know what it is like to be in prison.",
