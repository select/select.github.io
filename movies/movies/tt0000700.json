You can watch the whole film here: https://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation   \"Her First Adventure\" is a short crime drama.  The film is included in our program to illustrate the work of our star Billy Bitzer.  A very young Robert Harron appears as an extra in the crowd. A little girl strays away from home, attracted by street performers. As they move on, so does the girl. Upon discovering her absence the father starts a chase led by the family dog. The film is notable for two facts: first, for the acting performance of D.W. Griffith as the father, and second, for being the earliest film with the Biograph \"AB\" logo, posted on the piano, to discourage film piracy. Directed by                       Wallace McCutcheon Cinematography by         Billy Bitzer Starring                             D.W.
