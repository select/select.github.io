      "description": "The Narcotics Story began life as a training film for the LA police department. In sledgehammer fashion, producer-director Robert W. Larsen exposes the evils of marijuana, heroin and cocaine by illustrating the results of these drugs on \"normal\" people. The screaming, thrashing addicts depicted herein were actually played by police personnel, none of whom were exactly Academy Award prospects. There are also several scenes showing the manufacture and distribution of illegal drugs. Narcotics Story tends to elicit loud laughter when seen today, much like Reefer Madness and the \"Blue Boy\" episode from Dragnet. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide",
