    "Plot": "Heinz Rühmann is acting as always, a little bit too loud, almost shouting, seeming to be much older than he actually was. The story on the other side is so terrific, in some moments absurd, but in every minute funny, with fancy characters and sophisticated lines, that this movie is a pure joy to view! One girl forced to kiss every guy walking along, the other one a modern \"amazone\", shooting around with arrows, describe a new liberate form of sexuality which was not usual for this time and which was possible to be shown in a movie for only a very short time then. I do not know if there is an English version, perhaps it is impossible to translate the mood of the movie into another language, but I think this movie is to compare with something like \"My man Godfrey\", for example.",
