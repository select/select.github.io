Larsen, who had been ill for sometime, died this morning, his publicist Jørn Jeppesen has confirmed. The singer passed away in the company of his current wife and his six children. A nation mourns. Prostrate cancer couldn’t stop him Despite  a prostrate cancer diagnosis earlier this year, Larsen still managed to fulfil a number of appearances, including one at Smukfest in August. They are appearances that the lucky few who witnessed them will treasure as their last sighting of a singer who has held the nation’s ears in awe for one year shy of half a century. He first sprang to fame as the lead singer of the legendary band Gasolin’, and when they broke up in 1978 he went on to greater achievements as a solo artist. There won’t be a dry eye in Denmark as his song ‘Om lidt bli’r her stille’ (see video), a nation’s favourite at funerals, is played all over the airwaves this coming week. Quite simply, Denmark has lost its Elvis.  ",
