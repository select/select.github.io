      "description": "The last thing wanted by a tweedy literature professor (Hans Conried) while is wife is out of town, is the TV she bought to keep him company. But he discovers his new TV set is animate, apparently possessed by something from the future, and militantly intent on regulating his daily life. Based on the story by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
