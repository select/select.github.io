      "description": "The Gibson Goddess was directed by D W Griffith in 1909. It is one of Griffith's few ventures into comedy with mixed results. The Gibson Girl was a very popular image at the time. Here, from IMDB is an anonymous description of the film. \"A pack of admirers won't leave a beautiful woman alone at a seaside resort, so she devises a plan. She appears in a leg-revealing swimsuit, but the stockings have been stuffed with cotton to make her limbs appear misshapen. All but one of the men is driven off, and regret it when she removes the misleading leggings.\" Because it is a comedy, I have taken liberties with the music on this one.",
