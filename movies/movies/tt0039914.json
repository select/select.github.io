Coleman visits the bookshop of E.Charles (Gregory Gaye), forger of the book, and tells him the jig is up. Charles plots to kill Bill to prevent any further inquiries. Coleman then goes to his sister, Linda (Dale Evans), who is engaged to Bill and tells her a lie that Bill is mixed up with a forgery gang and that Bill is taking him to the gang's hideout. The car he and Bill are riding in is forced off the road and Coleman is killed and Bill injured. Linda thinks Bill had her brother hilled. Bill, in an effort to clear his name enlists the aid of \"Stevie.\" Linda still suspects Bill but since her brother mentioned Charles' bookshop, she and \"Stevie\" go there to investigate. The forger promptly makes prisoners of the two girls. Bill learns from Danny that the two girls are canvassing the city's bookstore but does not know which one, and his search for the two damsels-in-distress is hindered by Detective-Lieutenant Kirk (Grant Withers) who is suspicious of Bill.",
