    "Plot": "With an all-animal audience and all animal performers, it's a variety show of (bad) singers, eccentric dancers, gymnasts and piano playing.There's a nice, fluid piano version of \"12 Street Rag\", supposedly played by Krazy Kat, and that makes it an OK cartoon by me; it's a song that's always fun and impossible to ruin. Your taste may vary, of course; you may never have even heard of the tune. Perhaps, then, you'll enjoy the brief shot of Mickey Mouse in the audience.",
