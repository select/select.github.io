      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This critical and financial flop follows two French foreign legion soldiers trapped in a prison who remember the childhood and young adulthood they shared. While the film was a colossal loss of money for RKO Pictures, the creation of this film introduced important technological advances to the filming process overall.  I've uploaded two versions, one with higher quality but a small watermark in the upper right corner, and another with no watermark but noticeably worse quality.  Watermarked version sourced from \"Cult Cinema Classics\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEuo4JVM5PI",

This is not easy to do as John is confined to a prison for disgraced Legionaires and the people who put him there aren't overly concerned about who Isobel loves. But the resourceful John promises his love to an Arabian beauty, Zuleika, the 'Angel of Death', which gets him out of prison, and then he has to go after the evil Emir who caused him to fall into disgrace. Isobel waits patiently in England.",
