      "description": "The Ace of Hearts is a 1921 American crime drama film produced and directed by Wallace Worsley . The screenplay by Ruth Wightman is based on Gouverneur Morris's [1] story The Purple Flask , which was serialized in two parts in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1917. [2] The film stars Leatrice Joy , John Bowers , Raymond Hatton and Lon Chaney . One unique feature of this film is that the main title of the movie isn't written on the screen; rather an Ace of Hearts card is shown in its place instead. Prints of this film survive at the George Eastman House . [3] The film is readily available on DVD. A still exists showing Lon Chaney as Farralone [4]",
