      "description": "Scientists looking for fossils along the Amazon River find a strange prehistoric creature, half man and half reptile. It takes a liking to a research assistant (Julie Adams) who is engaged to the expedition's leader (Richard Carlson), whose boss (Richard Denning) expects to take credit for the find. The length of the movie is 1 hour and 19 minutes. Directed by Jack Arnold Richard Carlson as Dr. David Reed Julie Adams as Kay Lawrence Richard Denning as Dr. Mark Williams Antonio Moreno as Dr. Carl Maia Nestor Paiva as Captain Lucas Whit Bissell as Dr. Edwin Thompson I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
