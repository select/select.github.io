      "description": "1. As an unsuspecting wanderer between Maikammer and Hambach / Germany makes history. 2. Reassurance 3. Aborigines 4. Moons Lutz Mommartz' films focus attention on the mostly ignored confidante: The doves in the puddle, an ant swarm as a parable of human fuss, the course of the moon, flitting like a dirty spotlight through the night. Imperceptibly the only seemingly aimless camera succeeds to respond formally adequately to the brutal everyday life. In \"The italien Hunt\" the camera describes the chance of individual development. In \"Fear under the Stars\" it describes rude group behavior in the milieu of Cologne. The record of social poetry, destabilization, deformation and external occupation. (ANDREAS WILINK, DN, 14.9.90)",
