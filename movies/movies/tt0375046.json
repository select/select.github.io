    "Plot": "Lower Broadway is teeming with pedestrians on sidewalks and jay-walking, as horse-drawn cabs and streetcars are in abundance moving north and south. The cabs also cross Broadway as traffic allows. Men are in coats and ties, and most wear a bowler or a top hat. The few women are in street-length skirts and wide-brimmed hats. A cop keeps watch. The camera, which is at a second-story level, is the only thing that's stationary.",
