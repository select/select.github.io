    "Plot": "When Archie Cookson (Paul Rhys), a washed-up British spy, mysteriously receives stolen secret tapes, he becomes the target of an assassination by senior MI6 officials. Archie survives the elimination of his departmental colleagues only to be confronted by his long time friend and ex-CIA 'problem solver', Ennis Miller (Paul Ritter). Initially appearing to be Archie's salvation, Ennis is soon revealed to be a reluctant assassin hired to finish the job, but instead grants a stay of execution for Archie to reconcile his differences with his estranged family. As the grim reality of the next 48 hours begins to dawn on Archie, a chance encounter with an alluring young woman fires up the long lost passion and fight that Archie once possessed. Determined to evade his tormentors and bring to justice those responsible for the tapes, Archie battles to right his wrongs whilst inadvertently endangering the lives of those he loves in the process as Ennis tries to eliminate Archie Cookson.",
