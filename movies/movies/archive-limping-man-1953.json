      "description": "An American WWII veteran goes back to England after the war only to discover that his wartime sweetheart, whom he hasn't seen in six years, has gotten involved with a dangerous spy ring and is under surveillance by Scotland Yard. Lloyd Bridges as Franklyn Pryor Moira Lister as Pauline French Alan Wheatley as Inspector Braddock Leslie Phillips as Cameron Hélène Cordet as Helene Castle Bruce Beeby as Kendall Brown I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
