      "description": "Amos Kollek is a director, not many people know about these days. Still, film enthusiasts will know for his interesting take on New York in his films and collaborations with certain actors. Some of his films are accessible to watch online like platforms on the Internet Archive & Tubi , while others have fallen to obscurity and are very hard to find online. Fast Food Fast Women (2000) is a film that has fallen off the radar since it came out, but there are a lot of good qualities to find in this movie mainly the characters and the New York vibe in the turn of the millennia. Also, the film has Spanish subtitles made by the user who goes by rayorojo .  Plot Synopsis: Overworked Manhattan coffee shop waitress Bella isn't looking forward to her 35th birthday. Stuck in a relationship with a married man for far too long, Bella takes a chance on frustrated novelist/taxi driver Bruno. Determined not to scare yet another man off with her dreams of marriage and family, Bella plays it cool and tells Bruno she hates children. A tough break for the womanizer since his ex-wife has just dumped two small children on him ... In her coffee shop world, Bella witnesses she's not alone in the bittersweet battle against romance's difficulties. Shy widower Paul struggles through the tender courtship of lively widow Emily. Ornery old Seymour gets a magical shot of youth when he falls for a sexy exotic dancer. Despite love's accompanying twists and turns, everyone holds out for the best. And the persistent Bella discovers fairy tales can come true...even in New York City. The non-profit streaming of the commercial free, quality films I have very much enjoyed and therefore uploaded to archive.org, are for educational purposes. I have uploaded each movie for posterity, with the hope that all present and future generations will learn from and enjoy them, as much as I have. I own zero rights to this film, nor to any other I have uploaded, and I receive nothing for the uploads nor for the information I put with those uploads. Although I do receive great joy from sharing these uploads with you, I have no wish to infringe on any existing copyright laws.",
