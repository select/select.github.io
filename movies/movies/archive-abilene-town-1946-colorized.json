      "description": "Abilene, Kansas, in the years following the Civil War, is a town divided in two, with the cattlemen who want an open prairie on one side and the homesteaders who want to tame the land on the other. When a homesteader (Lloyd Bridges) upsets the delicate balance that had existed so far, the marshal (Randolph Scott) must prevent all-out war with no help from the county sheriff (Edgar Buchanan), as well as choose between a dance hall queen (Ann Dvorak) and a merchant's daughter (Rhonda Fleming). I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
