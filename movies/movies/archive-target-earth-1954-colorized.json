      "description": "A few random people (Kathleen Crowley, Richard Denning, Virginia Grey, Richard Reeves) wake up in Chicago only to discover the city abandoned. They find that the city is under attack by an army of alien robots. Meanwhile, a general (Arthur Space) and a scientist (Whit Bissell) attempt to find some way to fight back. I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
