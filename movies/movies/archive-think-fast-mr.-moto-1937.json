      "description": "On a ship bound from San Francisco to Shanghai, the Japanese sleuth becomes curious about some of the people on board, including the son of the owner of the shipping line, who falls in love with a mysterious woman who disappears when they arrive in Shanghai. Mr. Moto eventually uncovers the link between a mysterious letter, smuggling, and a murder back in San Francisco. Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentara Moto Virginia Field as Gloria Danton Thomas Beck as Bob Hitchings Sig Ruman as Nicolas Marloff Murray Kinnell as Joseph Wilkie John Rogers as Carson Lotus Long as Lela Liu George Cooper as Muggs Blake J. Carrol Naish as Adram I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
