      "description": "This is a simulated double feature program at a inner-city second-run movie house in the '60s. Rocket into the future with previews of coming attractions followed by a cartoon. Then in \"The Phantom Planet\" an astronaut lands on a mysterious asteroid populated by six-inch tall people - the cute ones in miniskirts. In the second feature presentation only Victor Jory can save Earth from being invaded by the slinky babes in black body stockings from \"Cat-Women of the Moon.\" (meow!) CAST NOTE: Richard Kiel's appearance as the \"Solarite\" monster in \"The Phantom Planet\" was his feature film debut. ",
