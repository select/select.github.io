      "description": "“Highly influential, largely forgotten and lots of fun.” “Max Steiner’s masterpiece” “Visually and sonically spectacular” “Awe inspiring” \"Best of many versions” “A visual treat” (IMDB reviews quotes). The second and best of the five screen adaptations of H Rider Haggard’s popular fantasy adventure novel. Helen Gahagan has the title role at the head of a good cast. The production values are exceptional with highly impressive visuals (see TIVIA) and a superb Steiner background score. IMDB rating 6.6. Directed by Lansing C Holden and Irving Pichel. Released in 1935. Complete print (original release). TRIVIA: The gigantic doors were recycled from “King Kong.” CAST NOTE: Shortly after making this film Helen Gahagan (Douglas) left the stage and screen for politics, and was elected to the US House of Representatives. Later during a senatorial campaign which became notorious for Richard Nixon’s highly unethical (and illegal) tactics she coined the term “Tricky Dick” which he never was able to escape.",
