There is his mistress Anya Roysen, a married woman, who was jealous of his flirtations with his old moll, night club singer Sally Marsh, who had agreed for one last night with Lother, to get her younger brother Ned out of the Lother's clutches because he has faked Lother's name on a check to pay his gambling debts. Then there is Sally's new flame Jimmy Brett, a con man and gentlemen thief, who has out-tricked Lother in a fixed poker game, and is, together with shorty, after the ladies jewels.

      "description": "“A whole amusement park” “Great film from the ‘30s” (IMDB reviews quotes). Comedy, romance, drama, crime drama; murder mystery, plus major musical production numbers and all this takes place on a single transatlantic ocean liner crossing. (I guess they ran out time for an iceberg) Extra-large cast of ‘30s movie and radio stalwarts. Jack Benny appears in a straight dramatic role. Good production values. Definitely entertaining, but even if it weren’t it would be worth viewing just to see how much can be crammed into a 90-minute movie. IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Benjamin Stoloff. Released in 1934. Complete print. AKA “Keep ’em Laughing” TRIVIA: The first time “rock’n’roll” appeared in a movie song title or lyrics.",
