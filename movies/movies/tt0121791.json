      "description": "  This version has better contrast and cleaner audio than previous IA prints. “Excellent propaganda film” “One of the better wartime documentaries” “A great document of World War II” (IMDB reviews quotes). A highly regarded British home front propaganda piece and docudrama of the RAF’s Bomber Command’s planing and execution of a night raid on Nazi Germany. No actors were used. Only RAF personnel appear (see cast note). Unfortunately the success shown did not reflect reality. Due to navigational errors and other factors, in 1941 the RAF’s night raids rarely hit anywhere near their targets. This would change for the better as the air war progressed. IMDB rating 6.6. Directed by Harry Watt. Released in 1941 (UK and US). Complete print. CAST NOTE: Sadly many of the air crew seen in this film did not survive the war. SPECIAL NOTE: In late 1943 the USAAF produced a similar although much more detailed film on daylight precision bombing.
