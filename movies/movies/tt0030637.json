      "description": "Loosely based on the Greek myth \"Pygmalion\" a Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory but his statue was so fair and realistic that he fell in love with it. The snobbish & intellectual Professor of languages, Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard) makes a bet with his friend (Scott Sunderland) that he can take a London flower seller, Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller), from the gutters and pass her off as a society lady. However he discovers that this involves dealing with a human being with ideas of her own.",
