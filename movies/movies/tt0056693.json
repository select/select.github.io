      "description": "Wild Guitar is a 1962 film starring Arch Hall Jr. as Bud Eagle, Arch Hall Sr. as Mike McCauley, Ray Dennis Steckler as Steak, and Nancy Czar as Vickie Wills. The movie was directed by Ray Dennis Steckler and was produced by Arch Hall Sr. The film was targeted towards the drive-in market, and is generally regarded as a B-movie, but has become infamous as part of a series of films made by Arch Hall Sr., which starred his son, Arch Hall Jr. The screenplay was written by Arch Hall Sr., Joe Thomas, and Bob Wehling, and the musical director was a high school friend of Arch Hall Jr., the young Alan O'Day, who went on to #1 pop hits in the 1970s.",

      "description": "Except for the fact that it stars Arch Hall, Jr., who's as cute as a warthog and as convincing an actor as Tor Johnson, this is a fairly entertaining little jukebox musical. Bud Eagle comes to Hollywood from Spearfish, South Dakota, signs with a sleazy agent, and becomes a big star. There's also a cute girl who can't act a lick, and a heavy in the form of Steak, played by Cash Flagg (really Ray Dennis Steckler, who directed). There's also some interesting camera work now and then (Vilmos Zsigmond did 2nd Unit photography here), and a truly surreal closing number that has to be seen to be believed. The file uploaded is a reasonably clear XviD AVI.",
