      "description": "The green tint has been removed from this print, and it now is in the standard MPEG4 (MP4) format with a smaller download footprint. “Bizarre salute to our boys ‘over there’” “A few nice laughs” “Strange lowbrow comedy” (IMDB reviews quotes). An oddball burlesque of the recently-ended WW1 that even includes a female impersonator. Not one of the Sennett gang’s best efforts. IMDB rating 5.6. Directed by Richard Jones. Released in 1919. Complete print. AKA “The Kaiser’s Last Squeal”",
