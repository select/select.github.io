      "description": "Razor’s Edge: The Legacy of Iranian Actresses By Fred Parvaneh , kayhan.london, February 24, 2017 The Story of Iran’s Actresses Is Told in New Film; Aghdashloo Attended L.A. Screening. An examination of the work and lives of actresses in the Iranian film industry prior to the 1979 revolution, featuring myriad interviews and rare film clips. \"Razor's Edge: The Legacy of Iranian Actresses\" looks at the often controversial role of women in Iranian cinema during the secular period from the 1930s to the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Through unprecedented access to the actresses and rare film clips of the works in which they appeared, filmmaker Bahman Maghsoudlou examines the effect that occurs when women gain expression in a stridently patriarchal society. The film will be submitted to all major festivals. Who were the first actresses in the history of Iranian cinema, and who are the female performers of today? A new documentary screened in L.A. in february brought answers to those questions – with Hollywood actress Shohreh Aghdashloo present both on screen and off. A sold-out audience attended the February 19 movie premiere of Bahman Maghsoudlou’s “Razor’s Edge: The Legacy of Iranian Actresses” at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. Sponsored by the Honar Foundation , the documentary tells the story of Iranian actresses from the 1930s to the present – through rare film clips and unprecedented access to the performers themselves. Several of the actresses in the documentary then participated in a post-screening panel discussion (held in Persian). Besides Shohreh Aghdashloo , they included Mary Apick , Vida Ghahremani , Fakhri Khorvash , Zinat Moadab and Partow Nooriala . The panel was moderated by the journalist and author Homa Sarshar , founder of the Honar Foundation . Aghdashloo said that she found it no different working in the U.S. today than working in Iran in the mid-to-late-1970s. “Maybe here and there, and exceptionally, there were people who looked at us actresses a bit differently, but in our generation, Iranians had great respect for actors, and for women working” in film, she said. “If an actress was thirsty, she wouldn’t get a drink of water any quicker than a man would,” she added. “I didn’t see any differentiation between male and female actors in my time.” The movie’s director, Dr. Bahman Maghsoudlou is a U.S.-educated producer and director who has dedicated his life to documenting Iranian cinema. The pre-screening reception was attended by many of L.A.’s prominent Iranian-Americans, and co-hosted by Bita Milanian. Also present were Haleh Javanshir, the movie’s editor, and her cameraman husband Serge Hamad. All proceeds from the sale of tickets were donated to benefit the movie, which will now be submitted to major international film festivals. * * * * * “Razor’s Edge” Farsi Show 02.21.17 by Taylor Thibodaux, kpcradio.com | Feb 28, 2017 | Spring 2017 -, ENTERTAINMENT, FEATURED Farsi Show with Hengame Abassi covered “Razor’s Edge” The Legacy of Iranian Actresses by Bahman Maghsouldou, a documentary 15 years in the making.
