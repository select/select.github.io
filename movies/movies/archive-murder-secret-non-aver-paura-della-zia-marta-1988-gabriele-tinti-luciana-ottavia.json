      "description": "A family of 4 makes a long drive to Aunt Martha's house to visit her for the first time in years. Only she isn't there. Just the caretaker and his message that she will appear the next day...if they survive the night. Lots of imported movies in the Sixties, Seventies and even into the Eighties went through multiple names and edits. This one has nine different ones at IMDb. One of the actresses, Luciana Ottaviani, has two other aliases including Jessica Moore and Gilda Germano.  I have included a couple extra of her names and the movie's names in the Tags. This is an awful copy of the film, but the only one I could find.",
