      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The first film directed by Erich von Stroheim, Blind Husbands was a massive critical and commercial hit, providing clout for his films for many years. In it, an Austrian soldier attempts to seduce an attention-deprived wife while distracting her husband with other affairs. I have uploaded the German-intertitled film, as this version has extra footage that the US version does not. I have also included an English subtitle track to the file.   ",
