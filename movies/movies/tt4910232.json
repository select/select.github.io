Each year the selected students will be lead and taught by the extremely talented and very friendly teachers (John Savage, Blanca Blanco, Adriana Volpe, Youma Diakite..), who will improve their students' skills, in order to prepare them for the \"Final Challenge\" of the year. At the same time, different stories of friendship, competition and strong emotions of the present and the past, interlace inside and outside the Academy, especially at the \"Zelo's Beach\" run by the hilarious Nathan (Bret Roberts) with the help of the crazy assistant Jonathan Bagoro. And there's more... Among the singing and dancing, new stories will begin; others won't continue, and some others will begin again. Everything set in the beautiful surroundings of the French Riviera.",
