    "Plot": "The Terrytoons are oddly interesting, mainly for anybody wanting to see (generally) older cartoons made by lesser known and lower-budget studios. They are a mixed bag in quality, with some better than others, often with outstanding music and with some mild amusement and charm and variable in animation, characterisation and content.1934, like all the other years for Terrytoons, saw a hit and miss batch, more so than the other years even. 'Hot Sands' manages to be one of the best ones. Not great as such, but it is pretty decent with some flaws but even more strengths. Flaws and strengths typically seen with Terrytoons generally. While its main reason for viewing is as a Terrytoons completest, 'Hot Sands' has more to it than that.Best asset is the music, which predictably is incredible. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and arranged, is great fun to listen to and full of lively energy, doing so well with enhancing the action. The ambitious, elaborate detail in the backgrounds is still great to see. Synchronisation is neat. There are some nice amusing gags, there is zest and a natural charm and the characters are nice enough.Parts of the animation, like some of the character designs and transitions, are a little crude still however.Likewise, the story is paper thin and formulaic, not an awful lot new here. While generating a little tension, the conflict can be fairly predictable. Occasionally, the cartoon is a little choppy and the gags are not enough and unimaginative generally, despite being amusing. In conclusion, decent. 6/10 Bethany Cox",
