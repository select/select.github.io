But they get captured and Jim is told he can join up only if he kills his friend.\n\nMovie Class by PizzaFLIX: Harry Carey (1878–1947) began acting in 1910 to become one of Silent Film's earliest superstars and successfully transitioned into \"talkies.\" He made 260 films and is best remembered as a cowboy. So much so, John Ford and John Wayne closed their iconic western THE SEARCHERS (1956) with a visual homage to Harry Carey.",
