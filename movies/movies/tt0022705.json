      "description": "Stars: Harry Carey, Kathleen Collins, George 'Gabby' Hayes\nDirector: William Nigh\n\n Jim Gray is looking for the gang leader known as the General. When Neil Denham is murdered, Jim assumes his identity. He and his pal Squint Saunders then try to join the gang. But they get captured and Jim is told he can join up only if he kills his friend.\n\nMovie Class by PizzaFLIX: Harry Carey (1878–1947) began acting in 1910 to become one of Silent Film's earliest superstars and successfully transitioned into \"talkies.\" He made 260 films and is best remembered as a cowboy. So much so, John Ford and John Wayne closed their iconic western THE SEARCHERS (1956) with a visual homage to Harry Carey.",
