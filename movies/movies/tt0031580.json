      "description": "In 1899, the young Sarah Crewe (Shirley Temple) is placed into an exclusive London boarding school by her widowed father, a wealthy British army officer about to embark for South Africa and fight in the second Boer war. Although she had previously spent all her life in India, Sarah adapts well to her new surroundings. However, things take a turn for the worse when her father is reported dead in battle and his South African financial holdings confiscated by the enemy, leaving her alone and penniless. This film is a bid-budget (1.5 million dollars per wikipedia) adaptation of the novel of the same name by Frances Rodgson Burnett. Little Lord Fauntleroy (1937) , which is also in the public domain and available on the archive, is another bid-budget adaptation of one of her novels. The film was originally available elsewhere on the archive as a 3.1GB MPEG2 . The files offered here are smaller and more accessible to people who might otherwise be discouraged by the sheer size of the MPEG2. The MPEG4 is a 2-pass, de-telecined H264 transcoding (using HandBrake 0.9.4 ) of the 3.1GB MPEG2 mentioned above. The AVI is a different print obtained from the Public Domain Torrents site.
