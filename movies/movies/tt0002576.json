    "Plot": "Jenks is a hypochondriac of the extreme type. Here he is at his villa, surrounded by flowers, gardens and orange groves. One would imagine that such a paradise would induce health and contentment in the mast abject \"gloom,\" but no, he believes that he has one foot in the grave, with the other one on slippery ground. The next hour he knows is to be his last. Hence, to humor him, his doctor orders him to the mountains. While there he is caught in a snowstorm, and his experiences make him glad to get back among the flowers.",
