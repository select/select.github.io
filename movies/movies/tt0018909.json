      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Even though director John Ford was prolific in his work between 1917 to 1928, with over fifty films to his name, this war drama is one of the few films he directed during that time that is not lost. While critics were lukewarm with opinions on the picture, Time Magazine said it was nicely cast and emotional. ",
