      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Even though director John Ford was prolific in his work between 1917 to 1928, with over fifty films to his name, this war drama is one of the few films he directed during that time that is not lost. While critics were lukewarm with opinions on the picture, Time Magazine said it was nicely cast and emotional. ",

Joseph is riding a hay wagon with a pretty girl when some of the hay falls off, landing on the fearsome Maj. Von Stomm. Joseph gets a slap from the major... The jovial postman has brought a letter from America. Joseph has the offer of a job in the States. But getting there is so expensive... It's Mother Bernle's birthday and most of the town gathers for the dancing. Mother gives Joseph the money she has secreted away. He leaves for the USA... It is \"Der Tag\", The Day when war is declared. Franz and Johann are excited about their new uniforms. But America is still neutral. Joseph runs the German-American Delicatessen with his new wife Annabelle. The reports of the first German battles with the Russians are good. So why does the postman carry a black-edged letter for Mother Bernle? When America does enter the war, Joseph enlists and meets his friend, the iceman from the deli... Times are very bad in Burgendorf. Von Stomm accuses Mother Bernle: she is the \"mother of a traitor\"...",
