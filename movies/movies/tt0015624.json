      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. The war epic that is thought to have inspired all-time-great films such as All Quiet on the Western Front, The Big Parade was praised in its time for realistically depicting war and its consequences. It is still thought of as one of the greatest films about World War I, and was a massive box office hit.
