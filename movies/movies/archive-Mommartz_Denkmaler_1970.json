      "description": "With Jürgen Kuhfuß \"Monuments\" is an attack on the meaning of monuments, here in Düsseldorf / Germany. And then suddenly a film with a recognizable concept was shown, an attack on the Monument Forest in Düsseldorf from imperialist and fascist days, along with the call to replace the monuments with memorials for the victims from these bloody times. That was a debatable attempt to make visible and attack the \"Unresolved past\". (PETER STEINHART, RP, 6.4.72)",
