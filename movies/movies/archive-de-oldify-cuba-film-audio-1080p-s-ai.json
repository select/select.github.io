      "description": "This film provides an interesting glimps of Havana and its surroundings in Cuba before the revolution in 1959 when Fidel Castro took over the regime and Cuba became a communist state. It shows great scenes of El Morro castle at the entrance of the harbor, the old center of Havana, cigar factories and rural life, accompanied by salsa music to enhance the atmosfere. The exact date of this film is unknown, but by looking at the car models it is estimated to be around 1948. The original film has been motion-stabilized, slightly speed-corrected, enhanced, restored and colorized with modern A.I. video software. Please just enjoy the film. No need to make unpleasant comments about what communism has done to this country, because that is well-documented and already debated to-the-bone.
