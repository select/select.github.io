David's a great salesman and he's successful attracting women, one after another. Joe, meanwhile, misses his deceased wife and is done with life. David gives Joe advice on how to get women's attention at the care center, and Joe gives David advice on how to find a lifelong companion. Each dismisses the other's words, then tries them out - David with Julie, a woman he met playing football, and Joe with Edna and with Rose. Failures follow success.
