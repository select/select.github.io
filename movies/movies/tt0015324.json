      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Buster Keaton's third film Sherlock Jr. was a critical and box office miss at the time of release. While the special effects were praised, it wasn't seen as very funny or witty by contemporaries. Modern viewers have come to appreciate the picture in a new lens, and Time magazine even labelled it as one of the top 100 films of all time. ",
