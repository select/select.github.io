      "description": "A homicidal maniac, who is strangling young women in London's West Side, is being sought by both Scotland Yard and a young reporter/writer (Judy Campbell). She finds one of the murder victims and sets out to get the story for her newspaper, as well as for the thriller yarns she writes. The trail leads to an eccentric millionaire living under an assumed name, and she uncovers enough evidence to convict the man. But then a new clue turns up in time to save him and unmask the real killer. Judy Campbell as Penny Sutton Sebastian Shaw as Tamsie Green Niall MacGinnis as Joe Henry Edwards as Inspector George Pughe as Oscar Kuloff Bill Fraser as Maxie I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
