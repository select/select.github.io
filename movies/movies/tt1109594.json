Stan's friend Billy has broken up with Alice, who is still in college in Ohio, and returns home to this parents outside D.C. Stan and Billy spend a lot of time together. There is a pretty and sarcastic girl who insulted them in the bar where they were drinking. Not a good idea. Billy talks to Alice a lot but she's not really there. Stan had his own bad breakup, with pretty Ashley, who he dated for five years. Ashley is missing and it's a big news story. It is eventually made clear that it is Stan, not Billy, who is going off the deep end. One day neither Stan nor Christian show up at the automotive sound equipment store where Stan is a manager.",
