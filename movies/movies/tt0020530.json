      "description": "Un Chien Andalou (English translation: \"An Andalusian Dog\") is a 1929 French silent short film directed by Luis Buñuel, and written by Buñuel and Salvador Dalí. Buñuel's first film, it was initially released in a limited capacity at Studio des Ursulines in Paris, but became popular and ran for eight months. Un Chien Andalou has no plot in the conventional sense of the word. With disjointed chronology, jumping from the initial \"once upon a time\" to \"eight years later\" without events or characters changing, it uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of the then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of tenuously related scenes. Un Chien Andalou is a seminal work in the genre of surrealist cinema.   source In 1960, Luis Buñuel added a soundtrack to the film. It has been uploaded as a separate file .",

A mysterious film open to interpretations ranging from deep to completely meaningless, this short (17-minute) film certainly presented something new in the cinema of its day.",
