      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, along with other pictures of the era that I find interesting, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This low-budget mystery only really has one claim to fame: being one of the few films from the year that entered the public domain early. That said, it does have a few interesting tidbits around it. It was one of the earliest films selected for television broadcast in 1942, and also stars Chinese-American actor James B. Leong in a minor role. It follows a group aboard a passenger plane that makes an emergency landing, only to discover that one of them is a killer. ",
