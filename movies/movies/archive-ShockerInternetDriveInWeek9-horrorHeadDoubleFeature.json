      "description": "Even though one of our past features was removed because someone after the fact determined that a movie was still copyrighted even though it was posted elsewhere on the archive, we will not be sidetracked! This week, we strongly suggest you get a good parking slot for our \"Horror Head\" Double Feature. After a hearty welcome and a classic Thanksgiving cartoon, we proudly present the 1959 gore classic \"The Brain That Wouldn't Die\", which is followed by a brief intermission and then \"The Head\", more or less the German version of our first film.
