      "description": "In Sing a Song of Six Pants (1947), the Three Stooges, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, run a struggling tailor shop called Pip Boys. Their business is about to be repossessed when they learn that a wanted bank robber, Terry Hargan, is hiding nearby with stolen money. By accident, Hargan leaves his trousers at their shop for mending, not realizing the loot is hidden inside. The Stooges discover the cash and scramble to catch the crook and collect the reward, while dodging both him and the police. The film is filled with slapstick chaos, quick jokes, and classic Stooges humor. Colorized and digitally enhanced as God intended.",
