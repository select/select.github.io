      "description": "In the grand tradition of every other \"Frankenstein\" movie, this \"Ultimix\" was cobbled together: \"a few scenes were ripped from uncut VHS and an Italian TV-rip, then muxed within dvdrip to make this longest uncut version,\" according to my source.   The Archive includes one at about 84-minutes; another is the German widescreen (sans audio) edition, at 89 minutes. But there may be yet another one out there: \"Incidentally, there’s some confusion about the running time of the film; the longest version is one shown on German TV at 99 minutes, and apparently the shorter versions of the film were created not by trimming the violence or the sex but by taking out important bits of plot exposition and thereby making the film seem much more incoherent than its original writers and director did.\"  http://moviemagg.blogspot.com/2012/10/lady-frankenstein-condor.html   In any case, “Lady Frankenstein Ultimix” is 96-minutes long, with English audio. Couldn't find an Italian movie poster, so here's one from France.  ",
