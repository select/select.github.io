      "description": "Westfront 1918 is a German war film, set mostly in the trenches of the Western Front during World War I. It was directed in 1930 by G. W. Pabst, from a screenplay by Ladislaus Vajda based on the novel Vier von der Infanterie by Ernst Johannsen. The film shows the effect of the war on a group of infantrymen portrayed by an ensemble cast led by screen veterans Fritz Kampers and Gustav Diessl. The film bears a very strong resemblance to its close contemporary All Quiet on the Western Front, an American production, although it has a much bleaker tone, consistent with Pabst's New Objectivity work through the late 1920s.",
