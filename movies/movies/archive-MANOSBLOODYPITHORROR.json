Burning process is beyond easy: Download zipped folder, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This disc features MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE & BLOODY PIT OF HORROR as well the preview and intermission reels. Enjoy the show! Made from stuff that's already here.",
