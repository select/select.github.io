      "description": "After a dormant volcano erupts miles outside of Los Angeles, something within the molten hot lava is awakened. Birthed from the bowels of the Earth itself, arachnid-like creatures with an obsidian-black exoskeleton swarm out. One man, COLTON WEST, a washed-up, former A-list action star, suddenly finds himself the real life hero as he’s forced to use his onscreen characters’ know-how to save the entire city from being victims to the most horrifying villains you couldn’t write any better.\n2015.

    "Plot": "Colton West, a once popular movie star and action hero from the 90s, is now reduced to acting in low-budget movies about horrific bugs. The old days of glamour and stardom, seem to be long forgotten and now Colton, the star of \"Red Rocket\", is having problems with the law, facing assault charges. On his way home after filming some scenes for his last action movie, Colton gets stuck in traffic and all of a sudden, a swarm of earthquakes hits Southern California, shaking the L.A. basin. To make matters worse, a volcanic eruption of the Santa Monica Mountains will lead to events of unprecedented scale, as chaos, panic and lava emerging from big gas-smelling gapes, begin to appear everywhere in town. On top of that, a new breed of lava-breathing arachnids are forcing a mandatory emergency evacuation of the city, so the need for Colton to go downtown and find his family is greater than ever. Armed with a shotgun and the will to survive, once more this intrepid man of action will have to do what he knows best. Will he reunite with his family, before all is lost?",
