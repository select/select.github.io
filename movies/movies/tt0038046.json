During the Austrian-Prussian War, Anna Maria (De Carlo) is a famous ballerina who has no other choice but to leave Europe after she is accused of being a spy. Jim Steed, (Rod Cameron), an American war correspondent, helps her escape to the United States, accompanied by her composer, Professor Max Blumenthal (J. Edward Bromberg). They eventually reach a small town in Arizona, where they meet an old entertainer, Madam Europe (Marjorie Rambeau), who joins them in a local performance of \"Salome,\" starring Anna Maria. She makes such an impact on the town that they re-name it \"Salome, Where She Danced.\" Anna also tames and falls in love with the local bandit, Cleve Blunt (David Bruce), who resembles her deceased lover, a Habsburg prince named Kurt. The group (Anna, Jim, Max, Madam Europe, and Cleve) moves on to San Francisco, where Anna attracts the attention of a wealthy Russian colonel (Walter Slezak) who decides to build her a new opera house. However, a Prussian nobleman (Albert Dekker) on the lookout for Anna, arrives in San Francisco with the intention of taking Anna back with him to Europe.",
