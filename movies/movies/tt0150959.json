      "description": "A comic interactions of \"hot-dog\" ice skaters on a frozen lake or river, and an Italian pushcart vendor who sells hot dogs to the ice skaters. A smart-aleck, larcenous skater tries to swipe a hot dog in a skate-by of the pushcart, resulting in a spinning amalgam of skaters and a long string of links. Other antics ensue on and under the ice.

    "Plot": "At the frozen pond, Krazy Ha, Kitty, and other animals in winter clothes are skating. An Italian vendor is pushing a sledge that contains hot dogs for sale. It's an idyllic scene, except this being a cartoon, no one is wearing pants, which must be chilly. And, oh yes, there's a larger critter, might be a dog, might be a bear, stealing the hot dogss and generally tormenting the other characters. At first it seems like high spirits. Then it seems mean.Had this one dated from half a dozen years earlier, when cartoons were just getting out of the synchronized sound era, it would have been a lively and superior study in animation and motion. Given its actual date, I'm not sure what effect they were trying for.",
