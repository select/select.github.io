    "Plot": "A black sheep tries to get even with his white siblings by scaring them. Is it a barely concealed metaphor for racism? No, it's just another variation of the Ugly Duckling with the Boy Who Cried Wolf from the Paul Terry Studio.This one looks like it was padded. the stage-Dutch teacher from earlier in the year shows up to introduce the story to his students. In addition, the gag are a bit scarce and the characters seem to be drawn a bit more crudely than Paul Terry's studio was doing this year. Add in the fact that the first half of the year had seen classic children's stories and the second half of 1934 love stories set in exotic locations, and this looks like a cartoon that was intended for the first half of the year, but when it didn't gel was withheld, then rushed into production to fill gap.",
