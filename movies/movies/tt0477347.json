      "description": "“Getting a lot out of 56 minutes” “Rare Anthony Mann film” “Creepy Freudian Gothic” (IMDB reviews quotes) A most unusual second feature mystery in which a WW2 marine receives love letters from a girl who has never been seen alive. Discovering the truth becomes a descent into madness. Good compact cast of only four main characters. However Helen Thimig’s performance as a woman who will stop at nothing steals the show. Recommended for when you feel like spending an hour on the dark side. IMDB rating 6.5. Directed by Anthony Mann. Released in 1944. Complete print. AKA “House of Terror”",

Larry accepts the job of night watchman in the Museum of Natural History and takes the place of three old security guards that have just retired in order to raise some money and pay his bills. On his first shift, Larry soon realizes that everything at the museum is not as it seems as the statues begin to come to life after the sun sets. The Museum transforms into complete chaos with the inexperienced Larry in charge as he learns that an old Egyptian stone that came to the Museum in 1950 brings these statues to life until dawn. When Larry brings his son to spend a night with him, the three old guards break into the Museum to try to steal the magical stone. Larry organizes all the historic characters to help him stop the criminals and save the museum.",
