      "description": "A professor of ancient languages (Tom Poston) comes into possession of a coin with magical powers, making him the target of enemy spies. With Julia Meade, Jim Backus, Fred Clark, Cecil Kellaway, Zeme North, Margaret Dumont, James Millhollin, Mike Mazurki I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
