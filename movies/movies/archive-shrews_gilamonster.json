      "description": "PREVIOUS PLAYBACK ISSUES FIXED. A COMPLETE DVD. Custom menu w/ poster art and audio. EASY BURN INSTRUCTIONS: save the zipped folder, open it, copy the VIDEO_TS folder, and burn it, that's the easiest way. I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be viewed here on this site. This disc features THE KILLER SHREWS & THE GIANT GILA MONSTER. These flicks actually played together back in the day. With preview and intermission reels, this disc is laid out just like an old drive-in show.",
