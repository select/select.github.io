    "Plot": "After being informed of the sudden death of her long lost composer father, a young virtuoso violinist, Rose Fisher (Freya Tingley), inherits an old mansion in which he used to live. There, she discovers her father's final work: a mysterious music score marked with strange symbols. With the help of Charles Vernais (Simon Abkarian), her agent and manager, she deciphers the symbols and, little by little, starts to unlock secrets concerning her father's past, setting in motion the mechanisms of a somber plan imagined since the day she was born. They soon discover that there's more to the sonata in question than meets the eye which, when played, triggers and unleashes dark and terrifying forces.",
