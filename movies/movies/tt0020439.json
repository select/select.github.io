      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. William Haines last film without recorded dialogue, Speedway follows a racecar driver whose main rival is his father. Reviews were decent but not superlative, and box office returns don't seem to have been worth noting. Near the end of the film a car is seen overturning several times. As a result of the crash, racecar driver Bill Spence was killed due to head trauma. ",

One day at the track, Bill sees the lovely Pat Bannon, and tries his best to impress her, but to no avail. On his way to catch a flight, he tricks Pat into taking him to the airport, and she gets even by taking him up in a plane. He hates to fly, but will not show her that he is afraid, and when the plane breaks up, he is a hero for rescuing her. This gets him publicity and Lee Renny offers him his car to drive in the Indianapolis 500. Bill breaks with Mac to drive the car and puts it on the pole for the race. Then Renny double crosses Bill and drives the car himself since Bill has tuned it so well.",
