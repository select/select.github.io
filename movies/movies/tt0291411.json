    "Plot": "It's the view of the gorge at Niagara Falls from a moving train.Although James White's movies are usually notable mostly for their poor camera placement, looking at the backs of crowds watching an event or, in his phantom train rides, focused almost entirely on the tracks, this one is a relatively pleasant view of the rough waters in the gorge itself. To that end, this resembles the series of 'Rough Seas' movies that were a favorite of early British movie makers. These appear, in turn, to be based on earlier photographic studies. It's good to remember that the movies did not arise with no reference to works in earlier arts.",
