    "Plot": "Mister Laurel and Mister Hardy are preparing to go to sleep in their room at a rooming-house. Unfortunately, Mister Hardy has a cold and sneezes a lot. He asks Mister Laurel to help him by applying a few home remedies to mitigate his cold. However, they both are clumsy and many unintended mishaps occur. The noise grows with every cry of pain caused by funny but painful accidents. This is exacerbated by the noise of falling objects and accidentally tripped bodies, amplified by Mister Hardy's yells of reprimand directed at Mister Laurel. This brings the landlord who threatens Misters Laurel and Hardy with eviction if peace and quiet is not restored immediately. To make things worse, the bed's inflatable air-mattress is accidentally punctured. To fix it, Mister Hardy tries to re-inflate it by connecting the mattress' air hose to the gas valve of the room's heating system. The mattress inflates very fast, actually way too fast. While Misters Laurel and Hardy panic, hard pressed against the room's ceiling, the landlord and two uniformed policemen burst into the room and cause a boom.",
