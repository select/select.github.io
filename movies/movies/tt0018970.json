    "Plot": "The esteemed and slightly eccentric scientist, Professor Padilla, is one crucial ingredient short to finally prove his theory--and much to his delight--Stan and Ollie are willing to lend a hand. Five hundred dollars in cash are theirs if the boys pay a visit to the local cemetery and bring Padilla back a fresh body to complete his bold experiment. Of course, nothing is what it seems in the shadowy realm of a horrible graveyard--and as the reluctant body snatchers struggle to fulfil their mission--strange sounds and blood-curdling encounters threaten to put an end to Stan and Ollie's assignment. Just how difficult is it to steal a dead man's body?",
