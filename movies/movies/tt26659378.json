      "title": "What Really Happened to Baby Jane? (1963) Drag Parody",
      "description": "Spearheaded by filmmaker Ray Harrison, the Gay Girls Riding Club (GGRC) took California’s 1960s underground gay scene by storm with drag spoofs of classic Hollywood films. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is the GGRC take on WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? -- filmed only a few months after the original’s release. This pioneering DIY movie is an essential snapshot of mid-century drag culture that would feel right at home with the dreamy work of Mike and George Kuchar. AGFA, in partnership with the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project, is thrilled to present this overlooked chapter of queer cinema -- preserved from the only known 16mm film elements in existence.",
