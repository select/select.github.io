      "description": "Early silent version of James Fenimore Cooper's classic story. It's not the best transfer in the world, and I couldn't find any info on this at IMDB, but according to the information I have, that's Bela Lugosi in the role of Chingachgook. If that's not Bela, it sure looks like him. Runs about 45 minutes.",
