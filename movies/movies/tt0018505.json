      "description": "The years of the NEP. Print worker Vladimir comes to Moscow from the province and temporarily lodges in the room of his battlefield friend Nikolai on 3rd Meshchanskaya Street. Lyudmila, the host’s wife, is fond of her guest, who, unlike her husband, is very kind to her. She makes no secret of her affection for Vladimir - and now the three of them will live together...\nOne of the riskiest Soviet romance films about new life. The first title of the picture is Menage a Trois. In the West, it was released as Three in a Cellar, and as Bed and Sofa in Germany. The movie was a great success but caused a string of scandals. Screenwriter Viktor Shklovsky was criticized for being disrespectful towards poet Mayakovsky and the Briks family, whom he knew well and whose love story supposedly inspired the film. The film was called immoral, and in the late 1920s it was banned. \n\nYear of production: 1927\n\nDirected by: Abram Room\nWritten by: Viktor Shklovsky, Abram Room \nDirector of photography: Gregory Giber\nProduction designers: Vasily Rakhals, Sergei Yutkevich\nStarring: Nikolai Batalov, Lyudmila Semyonova, Vladimir Fogel\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel, and be sure to click the bell so that you won’t miss the best Soviet movies! \n\n\n#love_triangle #USSR #roaring twenties #FullMoviesWithEngSubs",
