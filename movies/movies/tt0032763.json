Wrongfully imprisoned, Bill is caught in a prison escape attempt gone wrong, forcing him to flee into the harsh Arizona desert. With only a stray dog he names Wolf by his side, Bill seeks refuge in the town of Tempe. There, Dr. James Prentiss Harkness and his daughter Linda give him shelter, work, and trust. For a moment, Bill finds peace, but Mallon and his gang soon escape as well, staging a bank robbery and leaving Bill falsely accused once again. Determined to clear his name, Bill hunts down the criminals through blistering desert landscapes. One by one, Mallon’s men collapse in the unforgiving terrain, until only Bill, Mallon, and Wolf remain. With courage and loyalty on his side, Bill forces a confession from Mallon and is finally exonerated.
