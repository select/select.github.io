    "Plot": "This film may not be of strong interest to everyone, but I found it fascinating to watch from a historical standpoint. It is interesting to be able to get a glimpse into the actual goings- on of life in 1911 New York, and in particular the specifics of how these young girls were being trained for various occupations. But as the earlier reviewer said, what makes this film particularly enjoyable to watch over and over is the charming and inventive score composed by Elena Ruehr and performed marvelously by the QX Quartet and the Winsor School Small Chorus led by Lisa Taillacq.Note: the National Film Preservation Foundation has this available for viewing online, along with some interesting commentary and background on the film.",
