      "description": "Dr. Frankenstein is obsessed with re-animating the dead. He succeeds in assembling a living being from parts of several exhumed corpses, creating a confused monster. Directed by James Whale Based on the book by Mary Shelley (in which Dr. Frankenstein is named Victor) Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein Mae Clarke as Elizabeth John Boles as Victor Moritz Boris Karloff as The Monster Edward Van Sloan as Doctor Waldman Frederick Kerr as Baron Frankenstein Dwight Frye as Fritz I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
