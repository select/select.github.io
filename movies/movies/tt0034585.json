Bugs, not wanting to have a poster nailed over his home, ends up getting a pie in the face by the magician and vows revenge (\"Of course you realize this means war\"). Later, at the magic show, Bugs pulls many interesting gags to heckle the magician and even pretends to be a small boy from the audience who volunteers to help with a magic trick. Bugs then finishes it all off at the end with a pie in Ala Bahma's face and a Hawaiian song.",
