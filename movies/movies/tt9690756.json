    "Plot": "Spoiled single girl Angie Moore is living the good life in New York City - shopping, eating at the best restaurants, and no job to go to Monday Morning - all on her parents dime. But when her frustrated mother, Margaret, cuts Angie off 25 days before Christmas, Angie is determined to continue her lush lifestyle. When she discovers a sizable trust that she will inherit once she gets married, Angie decides to find a man to marry by Christmas. She heads back to her small hometown of Greenwood, a town she hasn't been back to since her father died two years before, with her sights set on her high school crush, heartthrob Tyler. But as she spends more time with Tyler's best friend, Gabe, offering to help him re-vamp his grandfather's diner, she rediscovers her true self, learns to let go of her grief, and remembers the true meaning of Christmas.",
