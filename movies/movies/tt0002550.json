    "Plot": "Joe would have been happily married to Emily if he could have kept his promise to give up drink. But seemingly it was impossible, and when drunk he became so reckless and dangerous that he had received the name of \"The Bad Man of San Fernand.\" A young man from across the desert meets Emily, and before long she consents to marry him. Joe hears of this, and, his mind inflamed by liquor, he sends a message to the new sweetheart that he will shoot him on sight. Emily fearful that Joe might carry out his threat, marries the young man at once and they start across the desert for home and safety. Joe hearing of this, vengefully follows. On the desert the ripping of their water sack has left the young couple without a supply of water, and when Joe overtakes them they are on the verge of dying from thirst. Gloating over his chance for revenge, he refuses their appeals for water and leaves them to die. He cannot, however, forget little Emily's heartrending appeals, and, his better self awakening to a realization of what he has done, he returns.",
