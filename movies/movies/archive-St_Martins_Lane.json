Charles, who recites dramatic monologues, sees that a young pickpocket, Libby, also has a talent for dancing and adds her to his act. Harley, the theater patron who never knew Libby took his gold cigarette case, is impressed by Libby's dancing and invites her to bring Charles and the other buskers in his group to an after-the-play party. Libby comes alone. A theatrical career is launched. Stars: Charles Laughton, Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison Writers: Charles Laughton, Bartlett Cormack Director: Tim Whelan Produced by Erich Pommer Charles Laughton",
