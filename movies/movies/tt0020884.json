But Ace and Tyson quickly inform her, and are well on their way to getting all of the Barton/Malden gold mine. The two songs are \"Wait for the Wagon\" and \"Oh, Susanna.\" Other than being filmed under the working title of \"California in 1878\", which was also the title of Jack Natteford's original story,and then getting sold to TV in 1949 and having the title changed, there are no other alternative titles on this film. Two alternative spellings are shown by some sources---fighting for fightin' and through for thru---but those are typos created by two different trade paper reviewers in 1930.Accuracy regarding B-western titles was not a sticky point with the trade papers of the day.There are several versions of this story, including a Maynard remake called \"Fargo Express\" and Reliable Pictures used the story for Bob Steele's \"The Pal from Texas.\"",
