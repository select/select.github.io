      "description": "“Great late night thriller” “Better than its reputation” “Cult classic” “Silly but enjoyable” “So bad it’s good” (IMDB reviews quotes). An outrageous old dark house mystery/horror with Bela Lugosi, a wacky plot and a satisfyingly large body count (eight). There ain’t nothin’ subtle about this potboiler. Good cast and good B-feature production. Lots of macabre fun. IMDB rating 5.7. Directed by Ben Stoloff. Released in 1933. Complete print (minus a few missing frames). A.K.A. “Terror in the Night”. TRIVIA: Although the role of the “Maniac” was credited to Edwin Maxwell, it's not known who  really played the part.",
