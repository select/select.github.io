    "Plot": "A dissipated looking man is seated at a table with a decanter of whiskey and a glass beside him. A large revolver is on the opposite side of the table. The man is evidently an habitual drunkard and is lamenting his fate. He pours out a glass of whiskey, and with a despairing look, starts to drink it. He changes his mind upon seeing the revolver and seizing it places it against his temple, but right here he changes his mind again, and laying the revolver carefully upon the table, drinks the whiskey with a contented smile. When the pistol is placed against his head, the audience becomes greatly excited until the old toper bursts into a fit of laughter and points comically at the audience, as much as to say, \"Did you ever get left?\" The effect produced is remarkable.",
