SIMPLE BURN INSTRUCTIONS: Download the .zip, open it, extract the VIDEO_TS folder and burn to disc, that's the easiest way. But I've also uploaded the files outside the .zip so they can be seen here on the site. This DVD contains the movies HERCULES AGAINST THE TYRANTS OF BABYLON & HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD, along with the preview and intermission reels.",
