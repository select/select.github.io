    "Plot": "A saucy, light-hearted romp, straight outta the Third Reich. Involves a Napoleon fanatic who goes to a conference on Napoleon in Paris and meets up with a blonde floozy showgirl. After the paparazzi snaps a picture of him together with the girl he must pretend to be her father in order to keep up appearances.He returns back home to his wife with the girl in tow, still pretending she's his daughter and his wife tricks him into thinking she had an affair with his best friend. After a hilarious duel goes wrong, the two gents work up a plot to put a mickey in the showgirl's drink so that she won't make an appearance at a big party and ruin his reputation. But his wife changes the table places and his best friend gets the mickey instead. More hilarity ensues.This is the one to catch if you're in a 1930s screwball kind of mood but you're tired of Hollywood flicks. Includes a great dream sequence, gags that hold up several decades later, and a quotation from Oscar Wilde. 8 out of 10.",
