    "Plot": "The Totville Eye is the name of a newspaper published in Totville. John Adams, the editor, has an assistant in the printing office, a kindly old fellow known as Scotty. Having at one time stuck type on a metropolitan daily, Scotty favors modern journalism, but his views make no impression on the formal Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams is suddenly called out of town. He departs leaving Scotty in charge. Just as Scotty and Sammy (the printer's devil) are about to lift the form of the first page on to the old-fashioned hand press they drop it and the type is \"pied.\" Scotty decides to set up an entirely new first page and to that end he nominates Sammy as the reporter and sends the youngster out to gather some real live village news. Sammy is in the act of picking up several choice bits of information and rushing back with his stories to Scotty who hastily puts them into type. When the paper is given out to the villagers the following morning the population is in an uproar, but as it happened in each ease the publication of the sensational news works out well for the persons involved. When Mr. Adams, the editor, returns and discovers the audacious articles in his staid old paper he has visions of a half-dozen libel suits, and his rage against Scotty knows no bounds for taking such a liberty. In the midst of his tirade he is interrupted by the various parties concerned, who come rushing into his office, as he supposes, to demand an explanation for his daring publication, but to his great astonishment , they express themselves most gratefully for the lesson it has taught them, and thank him again and again.",
