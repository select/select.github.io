      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. Night Parade is an early boxing-themed drama that would have inspired other boxing talkies of the era. In modern views it is mostly forgotten, as none of the stars were icons of the era, and reviews and box office were average. It is notable for being one of the few films that lead Hugh Trevor acted in before his untimely death. ",
