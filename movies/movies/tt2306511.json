After the discovery of a breakthrough cancer cure, a documentary film crew follows a group of researchers into the heart of the rain forest to capture the entire experience. With the cameras rolling at all times, the former Reality TV crew focuses on the researchers' personal dramas, leaving some feeling very uncomfortable as well as capturing strange unexplained occurrences. When the research samples are mysteriously destroyed, things take a deadly turn and they're left stranded, scared, and fighting for their lives, facing both physical and potentially supernatural forces. To make it back to civilization, they must traverse the dangerous rain forest and resist the mental and emotional anguish of this deadly journey.",
