      "description": "Willow and Wind - Beed-o baad (1999) Synopsis A young school boy was ordered to walk a long way to purchase a piece of window glass larger than he could carry back to his school. The weather was bitter and the wind so strong that he almost failed on the road. He tried hard and finally moved the load back to the classroom where he was supposed to fix up a broken window. He was all alone and no one to turn for help. The glass blew crushed in pieces by the wind... This is the best film I've seen in recent years. It gives helplessness and uncertainty a wider view, in isolated mountainy landscape. This one is a seamlessly made masterpiece by Iran director Mohammad-Ali Talebi. The child actor is very creditable. -- IMDb Cast: Hadi Alipour, Amir Janfada, Majid Alipour, Mohammad Sharif Ebrahimi",
