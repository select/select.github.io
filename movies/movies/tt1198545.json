    "Plot": "Since the days of Joan of Arc, fighting blood has not been confined to the sterner sex, and when danger has called dauntless women have been found at the fore in line with sons and husbands. Two women are involved in this silent playlet, Helen Masters, of the West, and Mrs. Henry Raymond, of the East; the one radiant with rampant red blood; the other cool and aristocratic to her finger tips. The West, rough and uncouth, had filled her with dread, but when she and Raymond appeared in the mining camp, Helen, unsophisticated in matters of the heart, merely looked and loved. So fast follows a tale. The woman of the mountains seemed to see in this man from the far East, her ideal, and her whole nature cried out against fate, which had mated him with a \"weakling.\" Raymond himself observed with dismay his wife's trepidation, her observance of petty things, and grew troubled by reason of her childish acts. In some similar measure his admiration grew for the self-dependent, strong and reliant Helen. Then danger came, and with it an alarm. Raymond, cornered and alone, fought for his life, and both the women of Fate's combine heard the call. One might have thought the response would have been single. Helen, aroused, seized her ready gun to fly to the aid of the man she loved, the red blood surging in her veins inspired vigorous action, but this time blue blood flew quickly to the emergency. The aristocrat became the dominant factor as of old, and rushing to the front, wrested the gun from Helen, went straight on into the bullet-swept zone of danger, and kneeling low over the man she loved, held the enemy at bay until Helen arrived with aid. When Raymond was nursed back to life, his love revived for the woman who had emerged from the shell of artificiality, and honest Helen recognized the justice of the proceeding by silently bowing to the inevitable.",
