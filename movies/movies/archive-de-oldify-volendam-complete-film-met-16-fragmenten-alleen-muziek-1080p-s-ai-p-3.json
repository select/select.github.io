      "description": "A compilation of a large number of highly important historic films about the Dutch fishing town of Volendam nearly a century ago. The original film material has been restored, speed corrected and artificially colorized. The result is an amazing one hour film! Volendam is a fishing village on the former Zuiderzee. Sinds this inner sea was enclosed by a 36 km dam called \"De Afsluitdijk\" in the 1930's the salt water has become sweet which had a huge impact on the fishing community. Fishing for eals has become the main activity. Other sources of income for Volendam used to be the cutting of reeds for the purpose of thatched roofs and other. It has always been a very close community where everbody knows everyone and many inhabitants are somehow related to each other. The village is also famous in the Netherlands for its pop music bands like BZN, The Cats and Jan Smit.",
