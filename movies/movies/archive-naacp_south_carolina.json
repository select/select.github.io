      "description": "A documentary produced by the National Association For the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on the racial disparities in the education provided in South Carolina public schools. The film was produced by the NAACP in its drive to desegregate schools which ultimately led to the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown vs Board of Education. We are shown what \"seperate but equal\" means in the ramshackle conditions of many school, dozens of young children piling into cars, the disparity in state funding and many other facets of the educational reality for Negro students. In addition to the full documentary approximately 35 minutes of outtakes from the film is available. The outtakes notably contain footage of Mary McLeod Bethune. Produced in partnership with the Harmon Foundation. This version was dubbed from VHS video from the Harmon Collection at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland.",
