Disrespectful and selfish, Sang-woo lashes out in anger, perceiving that he has been abandoned. He tries to trade his grandmother's only treasure, a hairpin, for a video game batteries; he throws his food and he throws tantrums. When Sang-woo's mother finds work and finally returns for him, Sang-woo has become a different boy. Through his grandmother's boundless patience and devotion, he learns to embrace empathy, humility and the importance of family.",
