      "description": "Robert Bennett (Dix) is a stockbroker who is very carefree with other people's money. Encouraging clients to buy stocks in companies that are failing is all in a day's work to him. His girlfriend Dorothy Hall has to raise $40,000 for a charity project, comes to him with $10,000 to invest from her charity group, and wants him to double it within five days. Meanwhile, E. M. Burke (Churchill), Frank Connelly (Bartels), and Clarence Van Dyke (Sparks) bet Bennett they will pay him $10,000 if he tells the truth for 24 hours. The men later go to a nightclub where they meet Sabel and Mabel Jackson (Gibson and Helen Kane), who are a gold-digging sister act. Cast Richard Dix as Robert Bennett Berton Churchill as E.M. Burke Louis John Bartels as Frank Connelly Ned Sparks as Clarence van Dyke Wynne Gibson as Sabel Jackson Helen Kane as Mabel Jackson Dorothy Hall as Gwenn Burke Madeline Grey as Mrs. E.M. Burke Nancy Ryan as Ethel Clark William Crane as Drunk Preston Foster as Nightclub Patron Producer: Victor Schertzinger Audio/Visual Black & White Uploaded by BoopBoopaddoop (Alternative Information from me to you, this is the VHS version, some parts are missing to the end of the movie, including Helen Kane's performance of \"Do Something\" But if you dislike her voice, im sure you wouldn't mind,apart from that the film is in full, and better quality than Dangerous Nan Mcgrew).",

      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. This drama is notable for being the first talking picture that star Richard Dix ever performed in. Otherwise, it has an interesting plot and mostly solid acting, but has seemingly been forgotten. Unfortunately the quality of the only remaining copy is very poor, and it is a bit difficult to watch in the current condition.",
