    "Plot": "Four estranged friends reunite and spend the night in a remote country house that was once home to a Manson Family like cult. As the night goes on, the strange rituals in the house's past open connections between the past, the present and the subconscious, forcing all the characters to confront their deepest secrets and darkest demons, or be destroyed by them. It's a blend of The Shining style freaky horror with the emotional character focus of a film like Magnolia. The film stars a number of prominent geek culture personalities including Amber Benson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Chloe Dykstra (Heroes of Cosplay), Tiffany Smith (DC All Access), etc.",
