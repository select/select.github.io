      "description": "I've been researching newly public domain films from 1929 and earlier, so I'm uploading the best possible copies that I can find. F.W. Murnau's first American film, Sunrise, is frequently lauded as one of the greatest silent films ever created. A romantic drama about infidelity, attempted murder, and rekindled love, it was a success critically and financially. ",
