      "description": "Title: Miss Lulu Bett Summary: A once-timid young woman gains newfound confidence after a failed marriage, much to the chagrin of her miserable family. Directed by: William C. de Mille Actors: Production Company: Paramount Pictures Release Date: November 1921 (USA) Aspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1 Wlliam deMille produced and directed Miss Lulu Bett, a film of extraordinary conviction and insight. It was then often the custom for unmarried women to lodge with family; thus we discover Miss Lulu in a boring Midwestern town, an exploited household drudge for her sister and her overbearing brother-in-law. In the course of the story (based upon the Pulitzer Prize play and novel by Zona Gale), Lulu evolves from slavery into an attractive and self-assured woman, prepared to make her own life. Revealed through wonderful performances and clever use of props, the characters are extraordinarily solid and involving.",
