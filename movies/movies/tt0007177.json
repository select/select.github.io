    "Plot": "Phable of the Phat Woman, The (1916) ** (out of 4) A pretty simple, one-joke film has an overweight woman doing everything she can to lose weight. She jogs, works out, goes into the steam box and even does construction. Three months later she weights herself and....she's gained weight. The entire film follows a predictable storyline but it was rather funny seeing the weight issue being told in 1916. The movie's animation is pretty rough but this does add a bit of charm as does the female character who is the butt of many jokes. I'm sure some might find the film offensive but I personally didn't take it too serious and got a few laughs out of it. The scene where the woman stands on her head and the aftermath is the highlight.",
