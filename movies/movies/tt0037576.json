Three years later, Kidd, posing as a respectable merchant captain, offers his services to the King of England. Seeking a social position, Kidd also negotiates for Blayne's title and lands, provided he can prove Blayne was associated with piracy. Launched upon his royal mission, Kidd is unaware that Blayne's son Adam is among the crew, determined to clear his father's name. Watch on RetroFlix:  https://retroflix.org/captain-kidd-1945/",

      "description": "With the exception of a few brief interludes this print is much sharper than the IA Feature Films Collection copy. “High seas fun” “Magnificent Charles Laughton” “Worthy sea adventure” “A bit disappointing” (IMDB reviews quotes). There may be more intrigue than action in this medium-budget pirate adventure, nevertheless Laughton more than makes up for it with his wonderfully over the top and ironic performance as the infamous captain. Randolph Scott costarrs at the head of a good supporting cast. The production values are adequate for the plot. IMDB rating 6.4. Directed by Rowland V Lee. Released in 1945. Complete Print.",
