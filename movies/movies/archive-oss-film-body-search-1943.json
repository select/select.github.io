      "description": "This classic video – originally titled as \"Body Search\" – is a dramatized spy training film produced by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the intelligence agency of the United States during World War 2, and the predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The film demonstrates and describes the body search process, and suggests ways to avoid being searched and how to avoid detection should search occur. \"It tells the story of an untrained, native courier who forgot, or perhaps never knew, that the quickest way to fail in your mission is to blow your cover.\"",
