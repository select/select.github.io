    "Plot": "Becky, a child, is left an orphan by the death of her father and is consigned to the tender mercies of the Misses Pinkertons, who conduct a fashionable school for girls. Becky feels keenly the semi-charitable nature of her life, and, when kindly-hearted Amelia Sedley invites her home, she eagerly accepts. It is then that Becky, the child, becomes Becky, the adventuress, cold, calculating and selfish. With the entrance of Becky into the peaceful Sedley home comes misfortune. Sedley goes bankrupt. Old man Osborne promptly breaks the engagement between Amelia and his son, George. Becky lays her traps for Joseph Sedley, Amelia's brother, and nearly succeeds in her designs on that self-satisfied young man. Urged by his faithful friend, Captain Dobbin, George marries Amelia. This change throws Becky into new surroundings. She goes to Queen's Crawley and enters the most active sphere of her existence. Her adventures with old Pit Crawley, her marriage to Rawdon Crawley, their poverty Becky's flirtation with Lord Steyne and her subsequent separation from Rawdon, the Battle of Waterloo and the death of George Osborne are all faithfully portrayed incidents of Thackeray's novel.",
