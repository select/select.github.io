      "description": "You can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and Film Nolr of the Week .   The Glass Wall is a 1953 American black-and-white drama Film Noir directed by Maxwell Shane and starring Vittorio Gassman and Gloria Grahame. The title refers to the design of the United Nations headquarters in New York City. The Secretariat building looks like a giant glass wall, 505 feet tall and having almost 40 stories.You can see the reflection of the city's skyline in the continuous rows of windows. It represents the uniting of nations to create a more cohesive world, yet the building seems less like a beacon and more like a giant impediment. In some ways, the building looks like a wall blocking the world from the US. It tied with two other films for the 1953 Golden Leopard, the top prize at the Locarno International Film Festival.",
