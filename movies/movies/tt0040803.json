    "Plot": "The growth of juvenile crime in a small town starts a movement for the building of a youth center. The project leaders discuss with the town mayor Phineas Wharton Sr. about buying an old warehouse from the city, and rebuilding it as the Center. The mayor, however, has his own plans to buy it himself for another project which he would profit from. The teenagers, now attending San Juan Junior College, Freddie Trimball, Dodie Rogers, Lee Watson, Betty Rogers, Roy Donne and the rest of Monogram's non-delinquent juveniles, think otherwise and, while the mayor does buy the warehouse, he is forced to donate it to the Youth Center committee.",
