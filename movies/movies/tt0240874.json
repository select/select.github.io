      "description": "MG 4068 // This film outlines the most common emotional illnesses that may be suffered by a civilian upon entering a military service and suggests how the individual serviceman can deal with them. Anxiety can be caused by isolation from family and familiar circumstances, the pressures of military training, lack of privacy in barracks life, and worry about performing one's duty. Footage of a sailor in the above situations is shown. A navy psychiatrist reassures a troubled seaman, helps him to understand what is happening to him, and gives him material to read that will guide him in his recovery. The seaman shares his reading material and his new self-knowledge with his buddies. They too suffer in greater or lesser degree from some of the effects of anxiety. Animation is used to illustrate the workings of the unconscious mind.  ",
