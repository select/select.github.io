      "description": "Machine - Vic, an ex mercenary turned hardened criminal and his partner Frank survive in LA's underground. They spend each day immersed in a cesspool of ruthless crime lords, dirty cops and desperate drug dealers. Their goal is simple...work both sides of the street and grab as much cash as possible. A fine idea until all factions are entwined in their plot and the result turns into a brutal earth-shattering explosion of evil versus evil.\n2006.

To help Lou recover from car-exhaust poisoning, Adam and Nick, with Adam's nephew Jacob, go to a winter resort that was their old party place. It's now a dump, but the lads rally for a night of drinking in the hot tub. Somehow, the hot tub takes them back to 1986, on a fateful night for each of them. Maybe if they do everything the same way they did that night, they'll get back to the future so Jacob can be born. There are serious temptations to do things differently. Will they make it back to their sorry lives? And what about Jacob?",
