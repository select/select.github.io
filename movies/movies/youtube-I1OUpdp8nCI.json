      "description": "Only Hell could breed such an enormous beast. Only God could destroy it! Well, if not God, how about a heroic hot-rodding teenager? That's the idea behind this independent slime fest from the same film company that produced another low budget \"classic,\" The Killer Shrews. Both were directed by Ray Kellogg, a special effects specialist and second unit director who would eventually work on some of Hollywood's biggest pictures. In 1959, though, it was all about Gila monsters and revved up teens. If there's a schlock Hall of Fame, this one deserves its own wing!\n\nWith bonus audio commentary:  Go to settings ⚙️ and select the Audio Track \"English Descriptive\" \n\nBlack & White version: https://youtu.be/apwWuNIsKwI\n\nDirected by Ray Kellogg\n\nMain cast:\nDon Sullivan - Chase Winstead\nLisa Simone - Lisa\nFred Graham - Sheriff Jeff\nShug Fisher - Old Man Harris\nBob Thompson - Mr. Wheeler\nJanice Stone - Missy Winstead\nKen Knox - Horatio Alger \"Steamroller\" Smith\nGay McLendon - Mrs. Winstead\nDon Flournoy - Gordy\nCecil Hunt - Mr. Compton\nStormy Meadows - Agatha Humphries\nHoward Ware - Ed Humphries\nPat Reeves - Rick\nJan McLendon - Jennie\nJerry Cortwright - Bob\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gsu7VGzgdaCZLpcv8iGWXLZYtR7XH8S\n\n@CultCinemaClassics",
