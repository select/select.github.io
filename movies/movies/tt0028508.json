    "Plot": "Royal Canadian Mounted Policemen Sergeant Gale Farrell and Constable Pat O'Hearne are on a mission to Twin Oaks in the dense Canadian wilderness to quell a war between rival fur trappers, and capture The Raven, a notorious gunman and killer, on his way to join the war. Pat returns to the post with the prisoner while Gale resumes his journey with the Raven's documents and identity. Gale contacts tavern owner McClain, suspected of being mixed up in the wholesale fur thefts, and convinces him that he is actually the Raven masquerading as a Mountie. McClain discloses some of the secrets of the operation but will not tell Gale the name of the ring leader. Gale meets Reynolds and Foster, the rival trappers who are accusing each other, and attempts to restore peace between them Reynolds is shot and wounded and Gale meets Ruth, his daughter, and falls in love with her. Gale learns that a fur buyer is at Twin Oaks and has just made a deal for ll of Reynolds' pelts. Foster, certain those are the pelts recently stolen from his warehouse goes to Twin Oaks and confirms his suspicions. Gale finds out that McClain has been stealing furs from both trappers, thus inciting both men into the present feud. Gale brings them together. Dr. Martin, Twin Oaks only physician, discovers Foster and Reynolds discussing McClain and speculating who the higher-up can be. It be him and he shoots both men. The wounded trappers are found by Gale, who also finds a string of wild doves recently killed by a hunter and some empty cartridges. He traces the evidence to Dr. Martin and rides to town to arrest him. But he is met by McClain and his men, who challenge his identity as the Raven. He hides outside his cabin and arrest McClain and his men when they show up to kill him. Pretending to be wounded, Gale stumbles into Martin's office and finds the gun which was used to shoot the two trappers. Dr. Martin and McClain are sent to the Mountie headquarters, while Gale remains behind to claim Ruth for his bride.",
