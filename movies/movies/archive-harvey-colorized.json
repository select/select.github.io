Dowd Josephine Hull as Veta Louise Dowd Simmons Charles Drake as Dr. Raymond Sanderson Cecil Kellaway as Dr. William Chumley Jesse White as Martin Wilson Victoria Horne as Myrtle Mae Simmons Wallace Ford as Ellis Logfren, The Taxi Driver Peggy Dow as Miss Kelly William Lynn as Judge Gaffney I colorized this using AI software that doesn't always get the colors right, but I think it looks fairly natural. Hopefully a more professional job will be done someday.",
