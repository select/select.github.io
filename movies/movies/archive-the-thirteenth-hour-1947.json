      "description": "The Thirteenth Hour is a 1947 American mystery film noir based on the radio drama The Whistler. Directed by William Clemens, the production features Richard Dix, Karen Morley and John Kellogg. It is the seventh of Columbia Pictures' eight \"Whistler\" films produced in the 1940s. This was the last of Dix's seven starring roles in the series, and one of only two that featured him in a sympathetic light. Suffering from heart disease, Dix was unable to continue his acting career and died in September 1949 at the age of 56. Plot: Trucking company owner/driver Steve Reynolds finds himself caught up in a feud with a rival firm. A masked assailant associated with the adversarial company attacks Steve and steals his truck. The thief runs down and kills a policeman and leaves other clues pointing at Reynolds as the murderer. With only a glove that has diamonds stashed inside the thumb, and the help of his love interest and her son, Reynolds evades police while working to clear himself.",
