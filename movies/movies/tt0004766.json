      "description": "The Virginian (1914) - Directed by Cecil B. DeMille https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian_(1914_film) https://www.cecilbdemille.com/portfolio-item/the-virginian/ Deinterlaced using Handbrake - (Decomb + Preset: EEDI2) Upscaled and enhanced using Topaz Video AI - (AI Model: Iris + Recover Original Detail 20 + Grain: Amount 7, Size 2) Topaz Video AI is software that uses artificial intelligence to enhance the quality of video footage. These settings produced the result that I was happiest with. Additional tweaking along with different settings may have improved the results further, however, I don't have the time nor the experience for that kind of experimentation. I added the layer of film grain to improve the visuals: it replaces the original grain that is often lost during the denoising process AND it prevents the picture from looking too cartoonish/waxy which can be caused by the enhancement process. Overall I am very impressed with the results - comparing it with the source video it's like night and day. I highly recommend Topaz Video AI.
