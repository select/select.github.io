      "description": "The Crime of Dr. Crespi is a 1935 American horror film directed by John H. Auer. It features a cast led by Erich von Stroheim, who plays the title role of Dr. Andre Crespi. The film is loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Premature Burial.\" Dr. Andre Crespi harbors a deep hatred for Dr. Stephen Ross, who has married Crespi's former girlfriend, Estelle. During a surgical procedure, Crespi drugs Ross, inducing a state of apparent death while Ross remains aware of his surroundings. Suspicion arises, leading to an exhumation where Ross awakens on the autopsy table. This film is considered a classic example of 1930s horror cinema, showcasing themes of revenge and the macabre.",

They exhume the body and find Ross alive, albeit now a terrified, ghostly figure given to stalking the hospital corridors.",
