      "description": "Mooch, a stray dog, rides the train to Hollywood to become a star. It would be best if she could find an owner/manager so she tries to ingratiate herself with famous stars. These include Vincent Price, James Darren, Jim Backus and others. Along the way, Zsa Zsa Gabor, the film's narrator, gives her helpful advice on practical matters.",
